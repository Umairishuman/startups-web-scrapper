            "Amico is a beautiful, compact hardwood box made out of marine plywood and finished in furniture grade teak veneer that delivers big, room-filling audio with no smart device required. It's a simple, all-in-one solution to streaming music with the ability to be taken with you wherever you want to enjoy your music.",
            "When you stream music straight from your Amico, your phone stays free to do everything else. Never waste your phone's battery with streaming again.",
            "The newest Como music system to accompany the Solo and Duetto- Como Amico. High quality sound and build, simplicity of use, and an unprecedented number of music listening options available at the touch of a button with the newest feature, wireless and battery powered for up to 8 hours play time at over 60% volume makes Amico the perfect choice for your portable audio needs.  The Amico only takes 4 hours to fully charge its lithium battery.  All units come with a battery pack ($50 value).",
            "Streaming and playing your favorite music and playlists are as easy as pressing a button. Everything can be done with the unit itself without tying your mobile device to the Amico. Simply press the desired button with your saved presets and listen!  Como Audio does offer its own app for the more technical savvy individuals for your convenience and simplicity.",
            "When streaming services took over, a lot of people stopped paying attention to sound quality. You listened through your earbuds, your laptop, your smartphone. Or you connected to a music player through Bluetooth and everything sounded a little better — as long as you stayed within 30 feet, and Mom didn’t call.",
            "Musica takes our \"Smart Speaker\" music system concept to the next level. In addition to an Ethernet connection, Musica integrates four more music streaming services: Tidal, Deezer & Napster, with Amazon Music integration expected Winter 2017. The system also has an on-board, single slot-loading CD player, giving the user access to CD-quality audio. Musica also boasts 8 presets (2 extra) which double as CD controls when in CD mode. The included remote adds CD controls to the functionality of the Duetto remote.",
            "Musica will work independently or as part of a multi-room system with other Como Audio music systems, allowing for a number of playback combination options, ranging from different sources on each device to the same source on all, including CD playback streamed from Musica.",
            "Control your music ANYWHERE from ANYWHERE.  Multi-Room capability allows you to play different music in any room or sync all of the rooms together.",
            "In the spirit of keeping things phone-free, every Amico comes with a remote control. That said, we do have a full-featured app: Como Control, which is an easy way to change things up from anywhere in the house. Available for iOS and Android.",
            "As a thank you to our backers for helping get the Amico and Musica off the ground, we’re offering a limited number of discounted products in our rewards. Grab your Kickstarter-exclusive discount before they run out.",
            "Whether he is introducing the theater experience to the home audiences with Advent and Kloss Video big screen TVs, or selling stereo systems direct to the consumer with Cambridge SoundWorks, or making high performance radios and music systems with great design and great sound reflective of another era with Tivoli Audio, Tom DeVesto never loses sight of the goal: make a high quality product that supports the latest technology — is simple to operate – has distinctive design – takes up a small amount of space – and doesn’t become obsolete.",
            "Millions of the products created by Tom DeVesto are used around the world today. He returns to the consumer electronics marketplace with a new Boston Massachusetts based company “Como Audio”. Here he will continue his goal of bringing high performance, vision, design and long lasting products to the consumer.",
            "Products that will, hopefully, continue to raise the bar on their expectations.",
            "We expect to fulfill all Kickstarter orders by fall of 2017. However, it's possible that our production schedule may shift based on the number of orders we receive.\n\nComo is staffed by a team of audio experts who have produced millions of music solutions over many decades. While we cannot confirm final production dates until our campaign ends, we have the knowledge and connections to execute the Amico quickly, beautifully, and with the highest audio quality.",

Using this information, the Mine Kafon Air creates systematic, efficient flight paths for subsequent detection and detonation drones. Therefore, the user knows the topography of the region and specifically of dangerous areas. The camera used is the mvBlueFOX-MLC. This module is a fully featured compact board-level camera perfectly targeted for space and cost sensitive OEM applications. A superior image quality in combination with a very high frame rate make the camera ideally suited for its purpose. \n\nThe final models used in the field to map the danger areas around the world will cost around €12k.
