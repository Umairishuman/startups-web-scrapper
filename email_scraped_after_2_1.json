      "The World's Most Satisfying Flashlight",
      "Red and Black DARKFADE",
      "When four years ago we decided to design the best flashlight we could ever think of we had two specific goals in mind: \n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you try DARKFADE you'll wonder why it's wasn't like this before",
      "We can\u2019t stand scrolling through flashlight modes to find the brightness you need. Is this the last one? Nope... And start counting modes again!",
      "NO THANK YOU!",
      "We solved this problem by making an invisible knob.",
      "But not only that, you can even decide the desired brightness BEFORE you turn it on!",
      "Do you want to turn it on at the lowest level to avoid disturbing others? EASY!",
      "It should always have been like that! Why did it take us four years?\n\n                          The Pocket Clip can be adjusted at any height and direction...",
      "Four years in the work, it's finally here!",
      "In the beginning, we tried adding things like magnets, spikes, clamps... ANYTHING WE COULD THINK OF!",
      "Until almost by accident we tried putting the lens at 45 degrees.\n\n \nRelax your hand and just raise it in the most natural way possible, this is what you get:",
      "This is by definition the most comfortable way of holding anything, this is the way you\u2019ll hold your DARKFADE.",
      "All of a sudden it was the most natural way possible and it\u2019s always right!",
      "No more holding the flashlight in your mouth or strapped to your head or all kind of other things that felt always WRONG!",
      "The WORLD'S MOST SATISFYING FLASHLIGHT",
      "Attach it to your belt or t-shirt and it always shines where you want",
      "Set it on the floor and it\u2019ll be always so satisfying!\n\n                        The most natural position in a flashlight, it's just satisfying to hold",
      "The World's Most Satisfying Flashlight",
      "We have chosen the best LED we could put our hands on (from SAMSUNG) but we didn\u2019t stop there.",
      "We designed a lens that\u2019s actually 200 microlenses together. This makes the smoothest light imaginable.",
      "Other flashlights, to be able to state on the box how far the light goes, use an old dirty trick of focusing the beam light right in the center.",
      "This allows them to write that the beam of lights goes incredibly far. What they don\u2019t tell you is that it is absolutely horrible",
      "Having a super bright center beam is not only annoying to look at but it\u2019s also incredibly useless! We opted for having the closest to perfect beam that\u2019s always usable and a pleasure to look at. No strange artifacts and the beam is smooth and nice from side to side.",
      "Our goal isn\u2019t to just turn the light on, is to turn the darkness off!",
      "The World's Most Satisfying Flashlight",
      "The charger is IN THE DARKFADE. Yes, it\u2019s a lot more expensive to produce this way but you can charge it with virtually any USB-C cable!",
      "The same cable and charger you already charge your phone with (hi Apple, we love you, but...).So finding a way to charge or keep charged your DARKFADE can be done anywhere you want.",
      "We keep one in the car the whole time... But what if you want to keep DARKFADE on for an insane amount of time? Well,",
      "Take your lovely battery-powered Dyson vacuum cleaner.",
      "The battery is low but you didn\u2019t quite finish. Easy you think, I just plug it in and use it wired like the good old times!",
      "Errm... Nope!",
      "It\u2019s actually not that easy for many different reasons. But we wanted to work and keep on even while you charge DARKFADE.",
      "So yeah, we did it! And it\u2019s awesome! Mostly in the most hardcore missions in the forest trying to find a Hobbit!",
      "Oh and there\u2019s one more thing...",
      "We plan to add a lot of functionalities to DARKFADE via software updates (Drag and drop files). The first one will be the sentinel mode.",
      "Just place it somewhere and it\u2019ll make noise and flashing lights as soon as someone or something will move it! This is your added security while camping in the forest or maybe just staying in a sketchy Motel room on your next adventure!",
      "You read that right, FREE SHIPPING WORLDWIDE! :)",
      "We're able to include the shipping costs in your pledge so no added costs at the end...",
      "We borrowed the idea of attaching accessories with a rail from the gun industry. We just made it thin and slick. This opens up to a number of possibilities, it\u2019s not just locking you into one.",
      "We\u2019ll release different attachments but we are makers, we make things adapt to our needs. This is why we\u2019ll release the 3d files to make your own rail attachments for ANYTHING YOU WANT!",
      "This data can slightly change based on the final components and how well the campaign goes. So please share it! :)",
      "PRO CLIP - Aluminum attachment (Add-on)",
      "Springsteel CLIP - Included in every DARKFADE",
      "These are not official data because they can vary on so many things that it's impossible to determine at this stage, but we can tell you what we aim for:",
      "3 hours on medium brightness",
      "10+ hours on low brightness",
      "But we're very proud of the fact that you can use DARKFADE with a power bank connected for as long as you want with a standard USB-C.",
      "The battery can be replaced easily and you can virtually use any 18650 Li-Ion since the discharge and overcharge protections are built-in in DARKFADE.",
      "We have also added two smaller LEDs in the lens (one green and one red) that will help know if your DARKFADE is running out of juice or if it's at full charge, and many other things. ;)",
      "Pro Clip",
      "Compared to the standard clip (included) made of just spring steel (it snaps in place) the PRO CLIP has a rail attachment in aluminum. This doesn\u2019t have just a more appealing look but it\u2019s also easier to position exactly where you want it and change position or orientation (standard clip remains included). We are designing a whole ecosystem of attachments for the rail as well as giving you the files to 3d print your own rail attachments!",
      "Magnetic Necklace",
      "This is probably the best way of positioning DARKFADE on you. Set the Magnetic Necklace under your t-shirt and just snap DARKFADE into place, change orientation and angle as you wish. Forget those heavy, eye-blinding lights strapped to your forehead! This is the way, right in from of your hands.",
      "Kinetic Driver",
      "This is our last campaign. Just in case you want to adjust your clip in real style! :)",

      "We're BLANC - we\u2019re passionate about designing problem solving products that are comfortable and useful to allow more exploring than ever before. The company is named after Mont Blanc - the highest peak in western Europe.",
      "Mount Blanc is a symbol of exploration which is home to hiking, skiing, paragliding, mountain biking, ice climbing, travel and on and on - to us Blanc is just that.",
      "Oh boy, we were hoping you\u2019d ask. We\u2019ve set out to design the warmest shirt on the planet! One major challenge is how to keep warm but also to not overheat or sweat. Most of us layer up to keep warm, but then end up getting too hot. When resting or starting an activity, you\u2019re cold, but when active, you can overheat. We thought, what if there was smart clothing that adapted to the body\u2019s needs?\n\nHere is the shirt that warms you when you need the heat, and doesn't overheat you! It warms you like multiple layers, but is lightweight and can be temperature adjusted to fit your needs. After many prototypes, design changes, manufacturer evaluations, performance tests, focus groups, and late nights...we\u2019re thrilled to share the shirt that will keep you feeling just right no matter where you are headed!",
      "Greg & Chris here - We're two brothers that were raised high up in the Rocky Mountains and have become quite familiar with the feeling of being cold all too well. Greg wanted to figure out a way to help people stave off the cold & as an engineer Greg started working on a technical shirt & built tons of prototypes. He started nailing down a really cool product.",
      "Greg brings the engineering and product design expertise to the table, while Chris brings experience in successfully launching products on crowdfunding platforms. Chris has launched two successful and Kickstarter and Indiegogo products and has a lot of experience from the top-down to get a campaign prepared and to get the rewards into your hands.\n\nWith your help we can meet the production minimums and bring this product to life!",
      "It\u2019s equal parts dapper and technical. The feel and look of the shirt was designed to be wearable not just under your top jacket but on it's own too! It has low profile features that sneak in technology without screaming tech geek. \n\nLet\u2019s start with the technical aspects of the shirt that make it so unique.",
      "We\u2019ve integrated a patented & lightweight battery powered carbon fiber heating technology throughout the shirt to keep your body warm for when and where you need it most. These heating elements use a carbon fiber technology that quickly heats up and efficiently draws minimal power. The carbon fibers are also non corrosive for a long lasting build that has been time tested so the shirt is durable + can be fully washed.\n\nCarbon fibers are the most durable & flexible heating fibers that can be packed tightly into tight travel bags.",
      "The shirt's power button is on the lower side, out of the way to avoid getting bumped and where it can be easily seen or felt to turn on.",
      "From lounging, traveling, or playing outside in nippy temperatures there\u2019s a warmth setting that will fit just right. Keep your body warm in vital locations on your body at the right temperature with the touch of a button.\n\nThere are three different warmth modes that can be used as a thermostat to cycle through the temperature that fits your needs.",
      "Low Warmth Setting",
      "Set the colored LED button to white and get hours of long lasting/steady warmth. Perfect for when you need a little extra warmth in a drafty movie theater, on an airplane, or at work.",
      "Medium Warmth Setting",
      "Click the colored LED button to advance to orange for the next warmth setting for an extra warmth boost. This setting is great for getting out the door on those early mornings with that crisp autumn air, at those chilly sporting events that go into double overtime, when you warm up for a run.",
      "High Warmth Setting",
      "Oh Baby, it\u2019s cold outside. The third heat setting is for when you really need furnace-like heat to curb the cold. This is what our ancestors dreamed about. Stay merry while on that family trip chopping down that perfect Christmas tree in the middle of the forest. Wear it under your jacket to keep toasty while on the ski slopes.",
      "The shirt comes with a strong 5000mAh power bank that packs a punch with a run time powering the shirt of up to 5 hours.",
      "The battery pack is lightweight and is about the size of an iPhone 6. The battery stores in the side pocket with room to spare. You won't feel the battery tugging the shirt down.",
      "Using the standard USB connection you can also use larger power bank to power the shirt by placing it in the shirt pocket, in your pocket, or in a pack using the extra long USB cable.",
      "The power bank can also be used to charge your devices when not heating the shirt - perfect for when a device like your phone needs a boost.",
      "The power bank has a digital power level display for accurate power checking.",
      "The shirt is available in sizes small, medium, large, and extra large. The shirt is stretchy and designed to fit both men and women.",
      "The sizes below are for both men and women. Just make sure you know your dimensions.",
      "Fit Type: Regular, will fit a little snug to your body to transfer the heat more efficiently.",
      "The entire shirt is washable! (yes...the circuits can handle it!) We have extensively tested the shirt in harsh conditions and through many cycles to verify long term use. Just remove the battery pack and throw your shirt in the wash for your next event or trip. It is best to air dry to keep the shirt lasting as long as possible.",
      "We used premium materials from the fabric. The heating elements, circuitry, zippers, and even tags are top notch. \n\nThe shirt material is a lightweight quick dry polyester on the outside with a super soft quick dry fabric on the inside to wick moisture away keeping you warm and dry.",

      "The watch born once in a blue moon \u2013 Enjoy your special moon bathing time.",
      "The very first watch allowing you to carry moons on your wrist whenever and wherever you go is born. Over a year effort on research and prototype, our OVD team finally comes up with this breaking design \u2013 the BlueMoon Watch.",
      "Time flies back to a night in 2020 Oct, Designer Ricky was walking under the moonlight in the countryside enjoying the 2nd blessing from the Blue Moon. Such moon bathing experience injected power, strength, and a sense of calmness to a person. OVD would like to create a watch with the same calming effect to the world.",
      "Blue Moon is a rare phenomenon. Blue Moon refers to the second full moon occurred />in one month. A Full Moon occurs roughly every 29.5 days so when the Full Moon falls at the very beginning of a month, it is highly likely that a Blue Moon will occur at the end of that month. Blue Moons that are blue are extremely rare and only occurs because of specific atmospheric conditions.",
      "BlueMoon Watch has two 3D moon phases coated with blue super-Luminova BG W9 on the dial. The 3D moon phases are tailor-made so wearer could adjust its location. To create the sense of calmness and stillness, numbers are removed from the watch so there won\u2019t be any distraction between wearer inner self and the moons.",
      "Glowing star map was imprinted on a cloud-shaped lens inserted inside the transparent dial. In the dark, it creates a dusty light effect and the hands with strong-luminova shining through the blue mist to tell the time.",
      "The 3D moons could be adjusted by the hidden crown. The crown is deliberately hidden to maintain its simplicity. The crown is completely merged into the watch while looking at the front. The integration of the crown into the streamline exudes the beauty of simplicity - less is more.",
      "Self-Modified movement",
      "Our engineers deliberately apply self-modification onto movement, boldly embed the two 3D moons on the original calendar disc. The moonphase disc will move to the next grid every 24 hours. A total of 31 grids are on the movement to fit the main idea of having two full blue moon in a month.",
      "Europa (OM01) is BlueMoon with ashy case, beige dial and sand leather strap to recreate the mineral content in the ice surface on Europa. Europa is the smallest of the four Galilean moons orbiting Jupiter.",
      "Nebule (OM02) is BlueMoon with PVD ice blue case, blue dial and blue leather strap to recreate the different elements within the nebula resulting in the beautiful glowing blues. Nebula is a distinct body of interstellar clouds.",
      "Nibiru (OM03) is BlueMoon with PVD khaki case, black dial and black leather strap to represent the transition from the dark mess to a golden future. In Mayan myth, Nibiru is said to be the planet that will collides with Earth.",
      "Gravity (OM04) is BlueMoon with PVD black case, black dial and black leather strap to represent the region where gravity is so strong that no lights could escape from it.",
      "Halley (OM05) is BlueMoon with raw steel case, silver dial and brown leather strap to represent the mixture composition of Halley\u2019s Comet \u2013 volatile ices and dust.",
      "The rotor of movement is also deliberately modified with attention. Sky map patterns is engraved on rotor. While the rotor is in motion, it will create the lightning bolts stretching across the sky captured by camera in slow-motion. Net-like etching pattern is also engraved on case. This idea comes from the dot and line pattern from the sky map.",
      "BlueMoon features a crystal caseback allowing a view of the rotor movement embedded with glowing stars to honor the history of engineering, craftsmanship and technique. Having an exhibition caseback reminds wearer to take a pause from the hustle life and talk to the inner self.",
      "The sapphire crystal is coated with a three-layer anti-reflective coating.",
      "Matching with a translucent upper surface, the arched edged surface is applied with 12 three-dimensional indexes creating a more sculptural appearance. The movement of the moonphase is special tailor-made to run under the surface. All these have increased the difficulty in producing this watch with very precise calculation and complicated assembly procedures..",
      "Special Italian crepe leather is used to make the watch more casual and reckless. With the superb craftsmanship of leather craftsmen, each watch carries a textured appearance. The leather strap is equipped with quick release spring bars, allowing users to quickly change their favorite belt styles without any tools at any time.",

Located in an artsy neighborhood, OD studio is surrounded by a rich combination of energies, values, and vibes. We hope this would lead us to the never-ending design journey with bolder and creative ideas rolling in.",
      "A lot of effort and time was devoted to perfecting the BlueMoon. We would like to keep the design united and make sure it truly achieves the same effect as a moon-bathing \u2013 to help people take a break and recharge.",

      "Powerful British design meets Swiss mechanics - 10 ATM - In stock & ready to ship.",
      "\u201cA powerful heritage design honouring traditional watchmaking. Painstakingly sculpted using the finest materials.\u201d",
      "Firle Watches takes its name from the Old English word fierol, meaning oak-covered land - a name that carries strength and integrity and a name that embodies our British heritage and landscape. The coastline that surrounds us here can often be fierce and powerful. These are the days we most look forward to \u2013 they force us to escape, and they bring with them possibility.",
      "The fine movements in our watches are every bit as rugged, powerful and beautiful as the ocean and landscape from which we draw our inspiration. Firle watches are for admirers of mechanical perfection, lovers of adventure - and lovers of life.",
      "In much the same way, we believe our timepieces will come to embody the story of those who wear them. They are designed to be with you for the whole journey.",
      "At Firle, we are passionate about the Ocean, it's the source of our inspiration and it's a place that provides us with a huge amount of joy. We believe it is the responsibility of both consumers and companies to minimise our impact on the environment. Which is we have decided to donate \u00a35 from the sale of every Firle timepiece to the charity Plastic Oceans. Plastic Oceans is a leading ocean clean-up initiative that aims to reduce the amount of plastic pollution in our oceans through science, sustainability and education. (More can be found on Plastic Oceans and our \u00a35 promise at the bottom of our campaign).",
      "A modern tribute to classic timepieces, offering a rich collision of design, with dials that embody the powerful colours of the mighty Cornish coast and a case honouring the elegance of vintage pocket watches.",
      "Firle's debut model, the Sennen Automatic, is a wristwatch that takes design inspiration from some of the best watchmakers in the world such as FP Journe, IWC, Cartier, Laurent Ferrier, and H. Moser.",
      "The Sennen takes its name from the Cornish Cove located on mainland England\u2019s most westerly point - Land's End. Exposed, it takes a battering from the most extreme conditions. The result is one of the most beautiful, contrasting landscapes in the world. Sennen and Cornwall have, in my eyes, always been a place of staggering beauty and power. A haven which as a surfer, or a nature lover, you can get completely lost in. Ultimately, it is a place of inspiration and reflection. This captivating coast provided me with a space to create the framework and design for the Sennen Watch by Firle.",
      "The Sennen Automatic's design is entirely unique; every part of it designed with absolute intent to create an incomparable piece.",
      "THE CASE - The Sennen Automatic case features a beautifully rounded 41mm case, modelled after traditional pocket watches produced by watchmakers like Waltham and Breguet.",
      "Seeing rounded cases is rare nowadays, this could be due to the difficulties in trying to create a flawless transition between lug and case. This was a detail that took me many months to perfect -a seemingly impossible task but it was vital for me to do this as I believe rounded cases are the embodiment of exceptional design. Not only does a rounded case ensure comfort, but it is a wonderfully simple expression of nature.",
      "The 41mm 316L stainless steel case could only be perfected if it were entirely polished.  Which I feel combined with its shape, exudes traditional watchmaking values and transports you back to the era of classic pocket watches.",
      "THE CRYSTAL - Committed to the utmost quality, the Sennen features an extremely high-grade scratch-resistant double-domed sapphire crystal, rather than the more common single-dome sapphire or mineral glass. This ensures that the watch can be viewed from any angle without creating any distortion of the dial. Furthermore, double-domed sapphire crystal increases the light luminosity on the dial, which creates a magnificent, radiant effect.",
      "THE CASE BACK - The Sennen features an open case-back revealing the beautiful STP1-11 movement through a flat high-grade sapphire crystal. The case-back is held in place via six titanium screws. Furthermore, the watch is water-resistant up to 10ATM - 100 Meters / 330 Feet.",
      "THE DIAL - I wanted the dials to reflect the deep, saturated colours of the rugged coastline that I\u2019ve come to love. The eerie blacks of the rock formations, the deep blues of the Atlantic Ocean, the whites of the sea foam and sand, and the greens that cover the coastline.",
      "The only way to truly replicate the vivid depth of these tones was by using enamel on the dial surface. Not too dissimilar to the grand feu method of enamelling, the enamel used on the Sennen uses a mixture of enamel glaze and fine glass compounds, which are repeatedly applied, heated and polished to achieve a perfect finish. The enamel provides the rich colours and the glass provides a shine comparable to the sun reflecting off the ocean. All of these different elements, weighted and balanced to perfection, finish off the classic yet modern design of 'The Sennen'.",
      "This laborious project has taken me four years to complete, the necessary amount of time to create a watch in which every component is custom designed. From the unique case and lugs right down to the hand-placed indexes and Assegai inspired hands, every part of the Sennen was been pored over until it was perfect.",
      "You might find similar, but you will not find the same design features on any other watch. This is what truly makes the Sennen a special, unmatched timepiece.",
      "The Sennen is powered by the Swiss-made calibre: STP1-11, an exquisite movement, specially selected for its thinness and quality.",
      "The STP1-11, at only 4.6mm, is one of the thinnest automatics on the market, allowing the Sennen to remain incredibly slim with a case thickness of 10.4mm, or 11.7mm with the double-domed sapphire crystal. This ensures it sits extremely well on the wrist, without being at all cumbersome.",
      "The STP1-11 is a high precision movement that operates at 28'800 vibrations per hour, 4 Hz and offers a 44-hour power reserve. The movement has a Perlage finish, and the rotor has a C\u00f4te de Geneve finish engraved with the Firle logo.",
      "All of our Sennen Automatic watches come with either:",
      "1. A faux crocodile print leather strap (genuine leather)  or",
      "2. A smooth Italian leather strap (genuine leather)",
      "THINKING OF ADDITIONAL STRAPS?",
      "VINTAGE COWHIDE STRAPS (sold separately)",
      "The Sennen Automatic can also be beautifully paired with our Vintage Cowhide Straps, which are designed to show signs of ageing and distress -perfect for giving your watch a rugged look and feel. A characteristic I am personally fond of. Please note these are not included with the watch but can be ordered separately.",
      "Available in Cognac (pictured on the left) and Light Brown (pictured on the right).",
      "We believe the initial presentation of your watch is extremely important. We also felt if we built something well enough, you would want to keep it \u2013 which is a more sustainable approach.",
      "Our presentation boxes are crafted from veneered Oak and MDF.  The inside of our boxes are lined using a luxury grey felt and are stamped with our gold foil Firle logo.",
      "Firle watches come with a beautifully illustrated user guide and a 2 or 5 warranty card.",
      "We wanted to take a more sustainable route with the rest of our packaging \u2013 our strap boxes, user guide, warranty card, shipping boxes, packaging tape and labels are all 100% recyclable.",
      "Our promise to reduce as much plastic as possible is implemented all along the way: our watches don\u2019t arrive with dust stickers and our packaging filler and label pouches are also all 100% biodegradable/compostable.",
      "Firle watches are made to last long into the future.",
      "The Sennen Automatic timepieces have been made using the highest quality components and materials by our rigorous and skilful manufacturers.",
      "Firle Watches are guaranteed against any manufacturing defects for a period of 24 months from the date of purchase. Please note the warranty does not cover any damage on any part of the watch resulting from abnormal use, lack of care, negligence, accidents, incorrect use of the watch and non-observance of the directions provided by Firle Watches.",
      "No. 001 WARRANTY",
      "No. 001 Sennen Automatics come with an exclusive 5-year warranty.",
      "All Firle watches will be personally inspected before shipment and will be accompanied with a Firle warranty card.",
      "\u201cFor four years I have been tirelessly working to make this dream a reality. I believe I have achieved my goal of an exquisite, expertly crafted watch and an honest brand.\u201d",
      "In recent years, the watch industry has become oversaturated with supposed minimalist, \u2018Bauhaus\u2019 inspired quartz watches featuring low-cost and low-quality components. Consumers are, understandably, drawn to these watches because of affordability -a factor not commonly found in the watch industry.",
      "Many of these brands centre around extravagant marketing, which promotes affluent and idealistic lifestyles that are simply unattainable for the average consumer. The visions fed to customers do not match their brand offering.",
      "I have to admit; I was fooled by this too. However, I soon realised there was a much more beautiful and honest way of doing things, which would honour the essence of watchmaking.",
      "After taking a closer look at the watch industry, I realised there was a massive gap in the market between the low-cost, low-quality offerings and the exorbitantly priced, good-quality brands.",
      "This pushed me to start thinking about the sort of watch that the industry was lacking.",
      "I was inspired by the need to create an honest and timeless brand, incorporating world-class components of highly complex mechanics, yet which falls into an affordable price bracket.",
      "Through my research, I became infatuated with mechanical movement. I firmly believe that mechanical watches are the only timepieces worth owning. A smooth sweeping second hand on the surface and an intricate marvel of interactions going on within the watch case that completely capture the imagination. I have dreamt about designing and creating a truly exceptional timepiece that does not represent a symbol of grandiosity but is a testament to the true art of watchmaking.",

      "This is what makes Brake Free special: it's not just a passive LED light that is constantly on (and in this case, it's on the continuous flash mode--more on that below).",
      "It responds to how you ride and alerts everyone around you when you're slowing down making you even more visible at this crucial point to prevent being rear ended.",
      "Above, you'll see Brake Free's CEO Alex Arkhangelskiy riding with the unit on, looking left and right, and bobbing his head in which the unit's LED lights did not glow brighter. Only until he pulls up to a stop, the LEDs then glow brightly syncing with his tail brake light wirelessly thanks to the accelerometer and gyroscope sensors onboard.",
      "We get asked a lot if the lights on Brake Free can be seen during the day time and the answer is a definite yes. The above is a raw clip from a GoPro mounted on the backpack of Brake Free's CEO Alex Arkhangelskiy slowing down during a day ride on the freeway.",
      "In fact, the lights are typically so bright that the camera's sensors are usually saturated from the 100 red LEDs.",
      "\"After nearly 42 years of working in the motorcycle industry, and 17 specializing in helmets, one thing continues to prove true. A rider can NEVER be too visible. The Brake Free system is about as simple as it gets, yet offers a level of visibility unavailable prior to its introduction. It\u2019s easy to install and will help riders to be seen when it counts the most. Brake Free is a simple, effective device that will dramatically improve the safety margin for all riders, regardless of skill level.\"",
      "\"Riding a motorcycle is like being invisible. To increase your odds of survival, it is crucial to increase your visibility. I use hi viz gear, headlight modulator and reflectors, and I will be adding Brake Free to ensure drivers see me.\"",
      "\"As the owner of a DIY motorcycle repair club I see so many bikes come in that have been clipped by cars that just did not see them or give them enough space for a turn. The novel idea of the Brake Free is a wonderful addition to increasing the visibility of all my riders - right at eye level for car drivers and without interfering with the riders reactions or responses. I'm recommending it to all the members!!\"",
      "Brake Free attaches to almost any helmet with our unique universal clip mount",
      "Mounts seen in the main pitch video are early prototypes and their look has changed from magnetic snap mounts to a mechanical clip mount.",
      "Brake Free is easy to turn on even with gloves thanks to its one-touch button. When it does turn on, it flashes to indicate its battery level:",
      "Brake Free also has a continuous flash mode which can be used as a hazard light. You can still wear it during this mode in which the light will function normally letting others know when you're slowing down by glowing brighter.",
      "And it's just as easy to turn off: Simple press and hold the one button for 3 seconds to turn off the unit.",
      "When it is time to charge Brake Free, simply use the included micro-USB cord to fully charge it in 2 hours.",
      "Each BRAKE FREE unit comes with:",
      "We've gone through a series of prototypes prior to settling on the final Brake Free design. We got feedback from countless riders and industry insiders to help steer our design. We worked hard to keep the design slim, stylish and versatile.",
      "We've come a long way since our first proof of concept prototype. This prototype helped us validate our idea of being able to use sensors to detect deceleration.",
      "This was our test rig for tesing our algorithm with our sensor package collecting data from the helmet while riding. It involved lots of packaging tape, but it served its purpose. Don't try this at home.",
      "Conducting measurements of the final design's LED brightness.",
      "Our team has worked tirelessly for almost 3 years designing, developing, testing and iterating Brake Free. We connected with many industry professionals, motorcycle groups, influencers, and riders to make sure we are developing a product that is truly valuable and needed in our community.\n\nWe invested countless hours and close to $100,000 of our own money to get Brake Free to the stage it is at now.

We have done our best to anticipate and account for many of them in our timeline and budget. And while there may be some unforeseen complications throughout our journey, we promise to let you, our backers, know first and be transparent.",
      "Click HERE to view our press kit",
      "How much does it weigh?\nBrake Free weighs 170 grams (6 ounces).\nFor easy comparison, it weighs a little less than an iPhone 7+.\n\nHow does it connect to my motorcycle?\nIt doesn't. We use sensors inside the unit along with our special algorithms that allow Brake Free to detect all types of braking; normal braking (applying front brake and/or rear brake) and engine braking.\n\nIsn't this a huge safety issue?\nThe Brake Free unit attaches to the helmet using a universal clip mount. The clip mount uses a 3M VHB adhesive (much like GoPro mounts) to attach to the helmet. It is designed to break away from the helmet in case of an accident. It won't cause torsional damage to your head and neck. You are much safer with it than without it.",
      "How long does the battery last?\nShort answer, 8-10 hours on average. Long answer, it depends on the type of riding you're doing and the mode you select.",
      "How long does it take to charge?\nBrake Free takes 2 hours for a full charge.",
      "Can I charge it on the go?\nYes. If you have a power bank or any other power source that can charge a device using USB cable, you can charge Brake Free while you ride.",
      "Can I use it with multiple bikes?\nYes! Brake Free is completely wireless. It does not have any connection to your motorcycle. So use it on as many bikes as you want.",
      "How do I know it fits my helmet?\nThe Brake Free unit is designed to fit all helmet shapes with horizontal or vertical feature lines. If the unit does not fit on your helmet let us know and we will come up with a custom mount solution.",
      "What type of helmets will it fit on?\nThe Brake Free unit fits helmet sizes XS to XXL, matte or gloss finish, full face or half helmets. We have attached the prototype unit to road race helmets, street helmets, touring helmets, adventure helmets, modular helmets, and more.",
      "How Do I install it on my helmet?\nBrake Free requires a clear spot of about 6 inches by 3 inches on the back of your helmet.\nFirst time installation:",
      "Will it fit if I have a Bluetooth module on my helmet?\nMajority of Bluetooth headsets mount to the side of the helmet. Brake Free mounts to the back of the helmet. You should be able to add both products to your helmet without any issues.",
      "How do I switch it from one helmet to another?\nThe easiest way is to order an extra helmet mount(s) and install one on each of the helmets you plan to you with Brake Free. Brake Free is designed for easy removal and installation. You can do this with one hand (without taking your gloves off)!\n\nHow can I tell how much battery charge is left?\nWhen the unit powers on it will indicate the battery status. We are currently using the center LED panels to do that.\n3 blinks = full battery, 2 blinks = 2/3 battery, 1 blink = 1/3 battery.\n\nHow can I tell it\u2019s working?\nWhen the unit powers up, it indicates the battery level. If the unit is in sleep mode, simply picking up the helmet will wake it up. You will see lights flashing as it wakes us. If picking it up or a quick shake did not wake it up, simply press the power button.",
      "Will it make noise on my helmet?\nNo. The shape was designed to work harmoniously with the natural air flow around a helmet. You won't even notice it's there.\n\nCan I ride with it in the rain?\nWe are aiming to get Brake Free IP64 certified, which means you can ride with it in the rain.",
      "Can I clean it?\nYes. Use a dry or slightly damp cloth to clean the unit. We recommend using microfiber towels to prevent scratching the surface.",
      "Is it legal?\nIn the United States there are no regulations preventing use of lights on helmets. Brake Free uses red LEDs that adhere to all DOT vehicle requirements.\n\nHow bright is it?\nIt is the brightest helmet accessory on the market by far. It is brighter than most motorcycle brake lights.\n\nCan I swap batteries?\nThe Brake Free unit is sealed. At this time our design prevents user access to the battery.",
      "Will my friends think I look awesome?\nYes! Totally.",
      "Can I wear it while riding in a group?\nYes! As a matter of fact, it will improve your safety as a group. Riding in tight formation with other members' bike noise can make engine braking even harder to detect. The Brake Free unit will generally detect deceleration quicker than the naked eye and alert the riders behind, giving them an extra split second to react to you.",
      "How is it different from other helmet mounted lights?\nWe are the only truly wireless helmet accessory. Brake Free is completely autonomous. It uses sensors and our algorithm to detect braking. Other units require a transmitter to be spliced into the wiring harness, causing potential electrical problems in the future. We also use lights that are thinner and brighter than anything out there.\n\nWhat kind of light source does it use? E.g., LED?\nWe are using 4 custom shaped LED panels. There are 100 LEDs in total. These LEDs have a wide viewing angle of 120 degrees.\n\nWhat color is the light?\nThe lens is red and so are the LEDs that are being used. These lights are so bright that they typically over-saturate the sensor on most cameras, making them look orange.",
      "How bright is the light relative to other brake lights, both OEM and auxiliary (both incandescent and LED)?\nBrake Free is brighter than most OEM brake lights. There are motorcycles coming out now with really bright brake lights, but they are still out of the line of sight of car drivers. The helmet lends itself as the perfect place to add more visibility.\n\nIf it uses an adhesive, does it damage the helmet (or leave a residue) when removed?\nWe are working with a 3M chemist to make sure we use an adhesive that will not damage your helmet when it is removed.\n\nCan I claim multiple perks?\nYes, if you'd like to claim multiple perks, please make a new contribution for each perk.\n\nCan I get a refund after the campaign has ended?\nThe money raised here on Indiegogo will go into product development, purchasing of materials, and manufacturing to deliver Brake Free to you. Refunds will only be issued if we can not deliver the final product after exploring all possible options. We will always be transparent and keep you updated on all developments.\n\nWill the product vary from the design above?\nWhile we have the preliminary design and prototypes built, we may still make some minor improvements. We love hearing from our supporters and if you have any suggestions we will be more than happy to consider it.",

    "allParagraphs": [
      "Microplastics in Blood? We\u2019re Building the Solution.",
      "Short summary",
      "Hi, we are Cristian and Zakaria \u2014 we graduated together in 2020 from high school with a diploma in Chemistry, Biotechnology, and Biomaterials with a focus on healthcare. We later worked together in a chemical laboratory where we tested the quality of active pharmaceutical ingredients. Today we are  respectively a Medical student and a Chemical Engineering student. Two different paths, but a single mission: to find a way to protect the human body from one of the most insidious invisible dangers of our time \u2014 micro and nanoplastics.",
      "Our project was born in the most spontaneous and authentic way possible: from a question raised during a study session in 2023. As we delved into the cellular and molecular mechanisms of the human body, we asked ourselves:\n\u201cWhat is the impact of microscopic artificial particles \u2014 such as micro and nanoplastics \u2014 within biological fluids? Can they interfere with human health?\u201d",
      "The lack of a clear answer pushed us to begin a long investigation. We discovered that although studies on microplastics in the environment are increasing, very few have addressed their direct impact on human health. And above all, no one has yet devised an effective method to remove them from the body.\nBut the data is alarming. Recent research shows that these particles are already present in blood, placenta, breast milk, and even in the heart. We are no longer talking only about environmental pollution: we are talking about internal pollution. We are talking about something that enters our body, travels through the blood, and can interact with organs and cells in ways still unknown.",
      "Thus, empowered by our shared laboratory experience and our passion for applied science, we began designing an innovative filtering module capable of separating and removing micro and nanoplastics from blood plasma \u2014 without damaging the other physiological components of blood.",
      "It is an ambitious project, never done before. But precisely for that reason, it is necessary. Because no one is doing it, and the time to act is now, before the problem becomes systemic.\nWe decided to launch this campaign because ideas alone are not enough. We need a place to work, materials, tools, and expert support. We need the first step. And to take it, we need you.",
      "With your help, we can build a prototype, start a startup, and begin a concrete journey toward protecting public health from one of the most silent and underestimated threats of our time.",
      "What We Need & What You Get",
      "Creativity and ingenuity alone are not enough to carry out a project of this scale. But we've now reached the point where we need concrete resources to turn our idea into reality. That\u2019s why we come to you with this campaign: to ask for financial support aimed at covering essential costs and giving a real boost to our work.",
      "The funds raised will be used to:\n\u2022 Create a safe and well-equipped workspace to develop the prototype\n\u2022 Purchase high-precision materials and components, including those in the field of nanotechnology\n\u2022 File a patent to protect the idea and make it scalable\n\u2022 Collaborate with external experts (such as biomedical engineers, materials chemists, and others)\n\u2022 Cover the operational costs of a laboratory for the first few months\n\u2022 Access coworking spaces\n\u2022 Purchase licenses and software for component design and advanced simulations",
      "Financial Goal\nOur initial goal is \u20ac15,000. This amount represents the minimum needed to build the first working prototype of the filtering module \u2014 a device never created before, designed to remove micro and nanoplastics from blood without damaging the vital components present in human plasma.",
      "If we exceed our target, the additional funds will still be reinvested in the project, particularly to support operating costs, coworking spaces, specialist tools, or expansion of the research network.",
      "What We Offer to Our Supporters\nWe know that this campaign is not tied to a finished product, but to a visionary and urgent idea: to prove that it is possible to remove micro and nanoplastics from human blood.

      "The Impact\nThis project goes beyond the two of us. It concerns the future of human health, the environment, and the relationship between technology and biology.",
      "We live in an era where plastic is everywhere: in the air, in the water, in food. Recent studies have demonstrated the presence of micro and nanoplastics in the blood, placenta, breast milk, cerebrospinal fluid, and even in human heart tissue. The scale of this contamination is no longer negligible, and growing evidence suggests these particles may negatively affect biological processes such as oxidative stress, inflammation, DNA damage, and immune system dysregulation.\n\nYet, no medical device in the world has been specifically designed to selectively remove these particles from human blood.\nWe want to change that.\nOur filtration module represents a pioneering technology, designed to be:\n\u2022 Compatible with existing transfusion systems (first intended application)\n\u2022 Adaptable to future blood purification devices (e.g., modified dialysis)\n\u2022 Potentially integrable in hospital settings, blood donations, intensive care, and clinical prevention",
      "If proven effective, our system could become a biological safety standard for:\n\u2022 Infants and children (more vulnerable to the effects of toxic environmental substances)\n\u2022 Immunocompromised individuals or people with chronic diseases\n\u2022 Blood or plasma donors and recipients\n\u2022 Cancer patients or those undergoing invasive therapies",
      "But our impact doesn\u2019t stop at the clinical level.\nBringing attention to the problem of microplastics in the blood also means raising public, regulatory, and industrial awareness, pushing toward a new generation of bio-technological solutions aimed at preventive health and environmental detoxification.\nIn a world that has just begun to realize the consequences of plastic pollution, being the first to act means having the chance to lead the change.\nWith your support, we can take the first concrete step toward a future where plastic no longer enters our blood.",
      "HERE WE PROVIDE SOME SCIENTIFIC ARTICLES FROM PUBMED THAT HIGHLIGHT THE PROBLEMS CAUSED BY THE ENTRY OF THESE SUBSTANCES INTO THE BODY",
      "Microplastics, nanoplastics and their heartfelt impact on cardiovascular health (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40247666/)",
      "Microplastics contamination and biological alterations in Atlantic wild fish populations, and human health risks associated to fillet consumption (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40253821/)",
      "Microplastics as benzo-a-pyrene carriers: genotoxicity assessmente simulating human gastric digestion (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40253306/)",
      "Risks & Challenges\nWe are fully aware that our project is ambitious and pioneering. Micro- and nanoplastics remain an underexplored and underregulated area in healthcare. While this may appear as a challenge, we view it as an opportunity \u2014 we don\u2019t want to follow the future; we want to shape it.",
      "Our goal is not only to respond to an existing problem, but to offer a concrete solution before it becomes globally overwhelming. We know very well that the path is long: laboratory tests, in vitro studies, biological validations, and complex regulatory phases await us. But we are moving forward with awareness, strategic intelligence, and great determination, knowing that every step taken today will be crucial tomorrow.",
      "This project is still in its early stages, but it is not a far-fetched idea \u2014 it has solid scientific foundations, a concrete application, and a clear vision. And above all, it has a profound purpose: to protect us from an invisible danger that is already inside us.",
      "With your support, we can turn this vision into reality. We want to build, test, demonstrate, and make accessible a technology capable of intercepting one of the most insidious emerging problems of our time so that we are ready.",
      "We are ready to face challenges, to make mistakes, to fall and get back up \u2014 but to overcome them all, we need you.",
      "Other Ways You Can Help\nWe understand that not everyone can contribute financially, but everyone can make a difference. Even sharing this campaign with friends, colleagues, or on social media will help us get closer to our goal: raising awareness and finding a concrete solution to the growing problem of micro and nanoplastics accumulation in our bodies.",
      "Spreading the idea is an integral part of change, and every single share can inspire new people, open new doors, and create new opportunities.",
      "If you have technical or scientific expertise \u2014 in biotechnology, engineering, nanotechnology, materials chemistry, or related fields \u2014 and would like to collaborate with us, contact us: we\u2019d be happy to meet you and see how we can work together.",

      "Your support during this campaign will enable us to accomplish the upcoming phases: prototype development, testing, commercial production, packaging, and full delivery to the customer.",
      "[How Ghydion Was Born]",
      "Over two years ago, while deployed to Qatar, Donovan suffered heat exhaustion due to dehydration. The temperature in that region easily ranges from  105 to 130 degrees. His medical emergency was a wake-up call and the realization that interval drinking was the key to consistent hydration.",
      "Donovan and the Ghydion team have committed over two years to industry research. Their discovery led them to the concept development and validation, planning, building a consultant team, and networking with design and manufacturing experts needed to produce the Ghydion Gallon.",
      "[Why Crowdfunding]",
      "When the idea of a smart gallon water bottle came to Donovan, he knew it was a product he himself desperately needed.

      "LIFESABER is the ultimate companion for backcountry survival. We believe it will become your 'mechatronic multitool' for every emergency.",
      "Not only is the LIFESABER an inexhaustible cell phone recharger, but it also functions as the hub for energizing custom accessories. These snap-in tools are compact, lightweight, reliable - and less expensive - because there are no redundant parts.",
      "Ultimately, you can enjoy the wilderness, without worrying about whether or not your cell phone battery will survive the trip.",
      "Let\u2019s be honest, your mobile phone is an essential tool in case of an emergency. But, when it runs out of power, there\u2019s no way to call for help when you need it most.",
      "With LIFESABER, you can recharge your phone at any time, indoor or out, with a simple ergonomic motion that even a child can master.",
      "In just 15 minutes - using the simple twirling motion of a jump rope - you can generate enough power to restart a dead cellphone. Or, you can produce the required energy in as little as 3 minutes by using your full forearm to 'powercrank' the LIFESABER.",
      "Simply shift the patent-pending Force-Multiplier into high gear, matching the torque (resistance) to the strength you can comfortably apply. The PowerGrip\u2122 handle features an unprecedented 5 degrees of comfortable motion.",
      "Using LIFESABER, you can keep your cell phone charged, survive the elements, and even ward off predators.",
      "Let\u2019s face it. Your cell phone might die in an emergency situation. What can you do?",
      "You could carry a spare battery, but that's usually only good for a single charge (assuming the battery hasn't already gone dead). Solar chargers are great, if you have the time and the sun is shining.",
      "There are also the old-fashioned 'crank' generators, but they are very awkward, tiring and inefficient (because they rely solely on limited wrist rotation), and only the most expensive models actually work.",
      "We\u2019ve designed a solution that is superior to everything else out there on the market.",
      "Not only can you recharge LIFESABER with a simply twirling or crank motion, but you can also recharge it from a wall outlet - or even a solar panel - so that the replaceable, high-capacity internal battery is always topped off.",
      "The LIFESABER comes equipped with a replaceable 2200 mAh capacity battery. This gives you more than enough juice to call for help, or to browse the web for routes, trails, and other valuable data.",
      "With the ruggedly-built LIFESABER in your backpack, glove compartment or bug-out bag, you'll never be alone in an emergency.",
      "The optional snap-in UV Water Purifier treats micro-biologically unsafe water with germicidal ultraviolet light. Ultraviolet water purification is a common method for disinfecting bacteria from water (but by no means a cure-all).",
      "It's suitable for treating water taken from a river or stream that looks clear, but contains dangerous microorganisms. After three minutes of cranking, you\u2019ll have enough power to sterilize one liter of unsafe water.",
      "Just insert and gently twirl to purify water. You'll have better drinking water in a matter of three minutes.",
      "UV water purifiers haven proven to be extremely effective at eliminating unwanted bacteria and germs from drinking water. The UV wavelength scrambles the DNA of any organisms in the water, so that they can\u2019t replicate and make you sick.",
      "This is a well-documented process that is backed in science (see more links at end of this section). It is a completely safe process and does not add any harmful chemicals to the water. As long as you don\u2019t touch or look directly into the UV bulb, it poses no threat.",
      "Do note, that these devices are only intended for use with clear water and that the volume of the container will determine the correct use of the UV wand (including time of immersion and the requirement to stir the water).",
      "We developed our UV snap-in module in response to requests from the hundreds of outdoor activists who we surveyed, many of whom are familiar with the safety and efficacy of using handheld UV devices, such as the Steripen\u2122 (which is the gold standard and the basis for our functional specifications). The owner of Steripen is Katadyn, a long-established Swiss company specializing in water treatment at all scales. We do not have a formal relationship with Katadyn, (or its Steripen subsidiary).",
      "They recognized that our UV wand could be made lighter (without sacrificing quality) since we wouldn't be duplicating the battery, controls, etc. already built into the LIFESABER.",

      "The snap-in fire starter (sold separately) creates a 2,000F degree arc to start fires even in the roughest weather. Three minutes of cranking will power 16 ignition cycles.",
      "Unlike a butane or methane lighter, absolutely no lighter fluid is required. Plasma lighters are battery powered.",

      "To signal rescuers (even flying overhead), or to startle animal or human intruders, select the built-in strobe light. Three minutes of cranking will power the strobe for up to 40 minutes.",
      "Also, with one button, you can trigger both the emergency siren and blinding strobe. This will get everyone\u2019s attention, while disorienting any attacker.",
      "The 85-decibel siren will operate for 35 minutes after just three minutes of cranking.",
      "With a reliable flashlight/lantern and emergency strobe button, LIFESABER is a solid investment in your family's future!",
      "The LIFESABER personal energy generator represents a technological revolution in efficiency and comfort. Our unique blend of patent-pending mechatronics enables even a child to generate the power they need in an emergency.",
      "The multi-jointed, telescoping handle of the LIFESABER enables a full 5 degrees of flexibility which accommodates the natural motion of the hand, wrist and forearm. In contrast, the crank of a typical manual generator is short and inflexible. This means that all the work has to be done by the wrist \u2013 which is awkward and quickly becomes tiring.",
      "The weighted grip at the end of our handle permits this swing arm to be 'twirled' much like the motion of a jump rope. This is a very comfortable activity which kids can sustain for hours on the playground.",
      "Alternatively, the extended handle can be gripped for power-cranking, putting the strength of the entire arm to work.",
      "Which brings us to our unique and essential force-multiplier technology.It stands to reason that you can overcome much greater resistance (torque) while cranking than when twirling.",
      "With the LIFESABER, the user can electronically (rather than mechanically) set the resistance (think gearing) to suit the mode (twirl vs. crank) and to match the person's strength. The higher the force multiplier setting, the more work will be accomplished during each rotation (and the faster you will generate electricity).",
      "That's why we expect that it will require a typical person (even a child) 15 minutes to generate a Quick Charge of 900 joules at the lowest resistance setting, while only 3 minutes of power cranking will produce the same results at the highest resistance setting. You can think of our proprietary technology as a kind of distant cousin to regenerative braking.",
      "We created the LIFESABER as a potentially life saving tool for:",
      "Ideation on the high-level spec for what was originally called the Personal Energy Generator (PEG) began more than 5 years ago. The challenge was to create a self-charging device that even a child could use to generate lifesaving power, but which would be ergonomically efficient for use by even the strongest adults. Of course, the device would also have to be compact, affordable, lightweight and wilderness-friendly.",
      "After 3 years and dozens of false starts and dead ends, I had an epiphany which led to the first of the technical breakthroughs which would be required. Specifically, development of a swing arm that could both be twirled (like a jump rope) yet comfortably cranked.",
      "The resulting PowerGrip\u2122 was successfully prototyped in July of 2018, which featured a telescoping arm with a weighted handle for twirling. It also served as the handle grip while for cranking. We created a unique, multi--jointed design which enables an unprecedented 5 degrees of freedom in the arm\u2019s motion. This results in comfortable, sustainable twirling or cranking while bringing to bear the full forearm strength of the user.",
      "But while necessary, the PowerGrip was not sufficient in order to realize the ambitious product objective. It took hundreds of additional hours to prove-out the second breakthrough technology \u2013 a dynamically adjustable torque control achieved solely through electronics (no mechanical gearing).",
      "In June of this year we completed our most advanced working prototype, enabling the user to toggle the \u2018Force Multiplier\u2019 circuit to match the rotation-resistance to the type of input (twirl vs. crank) and the strength of the user.",
      "This sophisticated prototype was privately demonstrated \u2013 to real acclaim \u2013 at the Outdoor Retailer show in Denver. While functional, none of our existing prototypes are optimized for manufacturability, which is why we've come on Kickstarter!",
      "I have many successful products on the market. The folks who backed my Lil Trucker Kickstarter campaign were pleased with the tools I delivered. In the risks/milestones section of the campaign page we detail the years of work to get to this point where we've demonstrated the crucial technologies - including the 'force multiplier' system.",
      "I have a colleague with a PhD in electrical engineering who has run all of the development and testing of the patent-pending circuitry. We are very confident in the physics/electronics as well as mechatronics overall.",
      "This project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 850+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $370M raised between them.",

      "AnyConsole Mini isn't just for gaming. Use it to any TV or monitor into a smart entertainment HUB. Play your favorite YouTube videos, stream Twitch, browse TikTok, watch TV shows \u2013 all on the big screen in 4K*.",
      "*AnyConsole Mini supports up to 4K resolution in theater mode. The final resolution might be limited by your phone's resolution.",
      "AnyConsole Mini also works a stylish desktop mount that can charge your smartphone. Never be interrupted by a low-battery warning again when you are gaming..",
      "With its ultra-slim and compact design, you can take it with you to plat games at parties or gatherings, share downtime with coworkers at the office, or use it when you\u2019re traveling.",
      "We shipped the first batch of 300 units on July 15th. The main batch will be shipped in October, guaranteed. Free international shipping is included for all perks. You can add an additional $15 for expedited air shipping.",
      "I'm a gamer since I was 3.",
      "I remember as a kid, trying to steal the controller from my older brother just to play a few minutes of Super Mario...",
      "I remember in my teens, my mom caught me at an internet cafe, while I was commanding my squad in Half-Life...",
      "I remember as a grownup, playing for hours and hours, and sometimes forgetting to eat, building my empire in Civilization...",
      "All my best memories of gaming have been on PCs and TVs. Nevertheless, I find myself spending more and more time on my smartphone, playing mobile games like PUBG and Mobile Legends. The first reason is that all my friends have moved to mobile platforms. Second, the latest mobile games are actually quite... AMAZING.",
      "But deep down, I miss my memories of gaming on big screens. For years, I've been searching for a device that would allow me to play mobile games on a TV, and I know I can't be the only one. Yes, there are things like Smart TVs and Chromecast, but the latency is unsuitable for gaming.",
      "So I thought it was time to bring CHANGE to the fifty-year-old gaming console market. We love PC and video games, but incredible games are emerging on mobile platforms as well. With years of research and development, we made it possible to play mobile games on a TV or monitor using any iOS or Android smartphone.",
      "Can I use an HDMI cable and a USB HUB instead?",
      "No. Except for a few Samsung phones, 99% of phones don't support HDMI output. You would need a Chromecast, but the latency is >1s. AnyConsole Mini uses our patented ESM (Electrical Spine Mirroring\u2122) technology for a better gaming experience. The ESM technology makes lag time so low that it is imperceivable to the human eye. Here is a full list of phones that support HDMI: https://bit.ly/3h3RHPI",
      "What's the different betweeen AnyConsole Mini and traditional game consoles like PS4?",
      "On PS4/Nintendo Switch, you are playing console games. On AnyConsole Mini, you are playing mobile games on the big screen.",
      "What's the different betweeen AnyConsole Mini and smartphone HUBs like Samsung DeX?",
      "There are two major differences:",
      "1. Smartphone HUBs like Samsung DeX only support less than 1% of phone models (such as 6 Samsung phones models), while AnyConsole Mini supports almost all phone models, including mainstream iOS and Android phones.",
      "2. You can use Samsung DeX for working and typing, but you can't use a keyboard or mouse to control your mobile games. In contrast, AnyConsole Mini enables you to control your virtual joystick with WASD and turn with a mouse.",
      "What's the difference between AnyConsole Mini and screen mirror devices like Chromecast/Smart TV casting?",
      "There are two major differences:",
      "1. With Chromecast, you will have ~1 second lag between your phone and the big screen. AnyConsole Mini uses our patented ESM (Electrical Spine Mirroring\u2122) technology, which makes lag time so low that it is imperceivable to the human eye.",
      "2. Chromecast only enables one-way video output. However, with AnyConsole Mini, you can control your phone with any USB keyboard and mouse.",
      "What smartphones are not supported?",
      "1. iOS devices with iOS 13.4 and above need to use a Bluetooth controller. USB controller/keyboard/mouse doesn't work with iOS 13.4 and above devices. iOS 13.3 and below can use Bluetooth controller/USB controller/keyboard/mouse.",
      "2. Android devices with MediaTek chips are NOT yet supported. Very few phones use MediaTek nowadays, the top 3 brands with most MediaTek phones are Tecno, Gionee, and Infinix.",
      "If I have an iOS 13.4 and above device, what are supported?",
      "Currently, the video output works perfectly, but the ESM reverse control is limited to one-point control, not 10-point. If you use your phone as the controller, it works fine. But if you want to use a USB controller/keyboard/mouse, you can only click one key at a time.",
      "Will I get banned for using AnyConsole Mini?",
      "Some games like Call of Duty Mobile (CoD) have official support for accessories like controllers. Some games don't have official support. AnyConsole Mini works with either situation. Our AI algorithm learns how your fingers control your phone, and it simulates the same thing (it's like virtual fingers floating on your phone's touchscreen). Our engineers have tested thousands of different games, including CoD, PUBG, and Fortnite. No tester got banned so far. However, you should always check the terms of use for the game that you play and comply with it.",
      "Is AnyConsole Mini an emulator?",
      "No. Emulators are PC software that lets you run Android apps on a computer. Your computer is providing the computing power. While using AnyConsole Mini, the game is running on your phone. In other words, your phone is still the \"brain\", and TV/monitor/keyboard/controller are just the parts of \"body\".",
      "Returns Policy",
      "You have 7 calendar days to return an item from the date you received it. Please ensure that the item you're returning is repackaged with all the included accessories when you received it. Return shipping is NOT included.",
      "We understand that many of you have been burned by other crowdfunding campaigns, which simply can't deliver products. We are an established company with a history of delivering computer hardware at a large scale in China. We are confident not only in our team, but also our partners, supply chain, and logistics providers. We bring proven experience in designing, manufacturing, and fulfilling products (both crowdsourced and otherwise) to the table.",
      "That said, even the biggest companies have some risks with bringing a new product through production and into market. A shipping container could get hit by a storm. A natural disaster could take out one of our suppliers. Even in the event of a disaster, we are confident we have the experience and resources to overcome it. COVID-19 previously delayed our production schedule for our PhoneBook product fulfillment, but we beat the challenges presented and went into our final mass production in May.",
      "During the fulfillment of PhoneBook, we updated our backers regularly with our progress and challenges. We know how important communication is, and we pledge to be open and transparent with you to the best of our ability. We also commit to resolving fulfillment issues as rapidly as possible with all our resources.",
      "We need your help to put AnyConsole Mini into large-scale mass production, and we sincerely thank you for your support.",

    "allParagraphs": [
      "Make tooth care even more sustainable\u2014with this beautiful, reusable container from TIO.",
      "Since 2014\u2026we\u2019ve been redesigning dental products at TIO...",
      "...environmentally friendly AND at the highest quality level of tooth care! To achieve this, we\u2019re constantly battling to advance as pioneers in the field of plant-based plastics. We want to prove in our own way that pollution can be avoided. Because sustainable redesign of an everyday object, such as dental floss, which billions of people use every day, can have a huge, positive impact on our environment. Read on to find out why we rethink, reduce and reuse.",
      "To reach the next level we need your support!",
      "We operate on comparably small profit margins with TIO and a big investment required to make TIOFLOSS happen is the creation of two injection moulding tools for our dispenser: One for the top and one for the bottom half.  We can then set up the manufacturing process and start the first production run. Your support would also allow us to purchase the required raw materials and cover our manufacturing partner\u2019s operating costs during the first round of TIOFLOSS production for our supporters.",
      "Our newly developed TIOFLOSS might seem like a small step at first sight...",
      "...but it\u2019s big step for us\u2014and mankind. Trailblazing doesn\u2019t come easy (especially when production lines suddenly stand still in a pandemic) and we kindly ask for your support to get TIOFLOSS set up for production and push the use of TIO\u2019s plant-based floss to the next level by reducing packaging even further with a reusable case.",
      "Why it\u2019s really time to make a change",
      "The ecological damage caused by the increasing amount of waste humans produce every day is immense. Climate change and the pollution of oceans are the first of many consequences if we don\u2019t make significant changes in the manufacturing of consumer goods. Due to their very short lifespan, personal hygiene products like dental ones are a key segment.",
      "Here's the sad reality of a single-use dispenser...",
      "The impact reusable floss dispensers could have",
      "Following your dentist's advice - flossing once a day with 0,5m (20\u2032\u2032) of floss - results in the consumption of 4-5 single use containers per year. Empty single use floss containers and their packaging in the U.S. would create ~ 15.000 tons of plastic waste. And that\u2019s just for one year! Just in the United States! (According to Statista, 235.8 million Americans used dental floss / flossers / picks in 2020)",
      "At TIO we minimize packaging wherever we can",
      "When designing our products, we place great emphasis on minimal material usage to preserve resources. We avoid unnecessary waste through newly invented refill concepts to relieve our ecosystem. Our refills will be packaged in an innovative paper-based, FSC-certified and recyclable material.",
      "Plants over plastic and a future without drilling",
      "We want a clean conscience and clean teeth: Instead of conventional plastic made of petroleum, we use plant-based bioplastics for all parts from yarn to dispenser. These renewable raw materials enable us to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions and avoid the fatal consequences of fossil fuel extraction, such as fracking or tanker accidents.",
      "The foundation of our floss and dispenser are renewable, vegetable raw materials. This saves CO\u2082 and allows you and many other people to clean up their carbon footprint and teeth. Our extensive material research helped us cut down green house gases by 55% compared to ordinary petro-based materials. Through downstream technical and procurement improvements, the carbon footprint can even be further reduced to just 22% of ordinary products.",
      "The TIOFLOSS materials separate it from\u2026the wasteful rest.",
      "Beyond the drastical improvement of the carbon footprint, there are many other benefits. The original plant used for our organic raw material is the fast-growing wonder tree that does not require large amounts of water, uses only a small acreage of farmland and is therefore perfectly suited for a future of sustainable agriculture. Furthermore the castor bean is inedible which makes the TIOFLOSS unique regarding it's minimal harm to our planet and the people living on it.",
      "By the way\u2026these guys want to thank you :)",
      "The process: From the field \u2013 to the press \u2013 to you",
      "If you're now wondering whether this sounds a little too good to be true: Since our floss doesn't completely grow on trees we would love to quickly explain how it\u2019s actually made because unfortunately using the type of plastic we use is still kind of unusual. This actually makes development a constant challenge for us. We've sketched together an overview of our material's journey that turns a plant into high-quality bio-plastic. Below you see the whole path\u2014from the plant to the finished product.",
      "And with your support the floss we produce will now get an equally natural home",
      "Sustainable manufacturing processes are also very important to us.",
      "Our Italian production facilities ensure fair working conditions and reduce the CO\u2082 exhaust due to short transport routes and a green energy production plant. With more than 20 years of experience in the development of dental floss and over 60 dedicated employees they can guarantee the best production possible. Their ISO 9001 Certification stands for the highest quality of product development and a rooftop full of solar panels has them classified AAA for energy efficiency.",
      "Reforestation against the climate crisis",
      "Although our products contribute to CO\u2082 reduction, based on the current standard of knowledge, nothing can combat global warming as effectively as reforestation. To help absorb even more CO\u2082 emissions, we also support Plant-for-the-Planet on their mission to fight the climate crisis.",
      "Flossing at the highest quality level",
      "Dental health is an important issue and everyone depends on reliable care products. We stand for the best possible dental cleaning. Because healthy teeth simply make life better. Therefore, compromises regarding the quality of care are never an option for us. We focus on maximum hygiene and cleaning performance for all of our products.",
      "We are enthusiasts for sustainable design by heart.",
      "As a company founded by two seasoned designers we have been trying to achieve the best possible result for people and nature alike through our products by combining material research and resource-saving design. To be honest: That really wasn\u2019t always easy. There are many hurdles you face along the way, that we would have never expected beforehand. It\u2019s something we have experienced almost constantly. But we won't let that stop us from thinking about every last detail.",
      "Perks",
      "Every contribution counts and here's a breakdown of your pledge options that will help us make TIOFLOSS a reality!",
      "Tiofloss & Tiobrush bundles",
      "Since dental floss only does half the job, we're offering attractive bundles of our plant based replaceable head toothbrush and our Tiofloss. Tiobrush, our timeless classic made of plant-based bioplastics with a reusable, ergonomic handle for a good grip and replaceable brush head\u2014 hopefully just one of many to come. Tiobrush also includes a hygienic travel cap. The only thing not included: A bunch of marketing blah-blah. Tiobrush neatly cleans your teeth and toothbrushes aren\u2019t rocket science.",
      "Retailer Special",
      "Progressive retailers who share the TIO vision\u2014this reward is for you! We are offering our purchase units in practical shipping boxes which can be transformed into attractive point of sale displays. Important note: This pledge requires a proof of business!",
      "The TIOFLOSS Countdown",
      "Here\u2019s current stauts: All the details about when you can expect to receive your TIOFLOSS (dispenser and floss of course) and what comes next.",
      "And lastly...a little more about the team.",
      "Our path.",
      "The two on the photo in bright white fine rib, that's us\u2014Fabian and Benjamin the founders of TIO. Although we temporarily parted ways after our design studies, we stayed connected by a shared passion to question the status quo. Our goal as designers has always been fully understanding the big picture and creating better solutions based on it. That\u2019s exactly why we finally founded TIO in 2015 and developed our first plant based toothbrush\u2014with a replaceable head from day one.",
      "Maybe because our natural materials have given us many sleepless nights, we\u2019re all the more enthusiastic for each time we\u2019ve beaten the odds and figured how to make it work. We\u2019ll keep giving our absolute best to make sure you can scrub your teeth with TIO products better and more sustainably in the future. Developing purposeful and ecological concepts is what drives us. And: It\u2019s actually fun.",
      "In 2017 we joined forces with Christoph, Sebastian, Wanja and their team from wasserneutral. The three are friends from Hamburg who share our passion for sustainable businesses. We met during a trade show. After several long and enthusiastic conversations we decided that we can learn a lot from each other and so we set the foundation for a fruitful cooperation! Since then we've been able to rely on their profound experience in marketing, sales and distribution which will help us to fulfill your orders as soon as possible.",

      "I can recall as a child, having the store-bought ramen when I got home from school. Adding fancy ingredients as toppings in an attempt to recreate what I saw in popular Japanese animation.",
      "Years later when I got to experience to my first real ramen shop, my mind was blown. Learning the histories of ramen Yatai (food carts) in Japan. I would imagine what it would be like to run a little shop of my own.,",
      "Nowadays, friends & I travel great lengths to try new ramen establishments throughout our region, making a game out of finding the best flavors.",
      "To me, Ramen is life",
      "For almost 30 years I have worked in the restaurant business.  From washing dishes to orchestrating whole meal plans for residential communities.",
      "From feeding afluent retirees to those living with food scarcity. Pizza joints to themed catering feasts. For friends and family.",
      "Over the course of my life, food has truly become my passion.",
      "Now, I want a chance to break out on my own, making something I truly love. By opening my own pop up ramen shop, without the overhead and hassle of a physical location; I would be able to serve my community my own blend of happiness, noodles and toppings across my state. From board walks and back lots to LARPing events and festivals, the location options are endless.",
      "Help me fulfill my dream.",
      "To me, Ramen is hope",
      "Taking inspiration from the Yatai food carts in Japan, my shop will be collapsible and mobile.  Capable of going from set up to service in a short amount of time, my pop up will be able to travel and bring food to the community, not the other way around.",
      "Also taking the popular Yatai idea of a ramen or food shrine, our community has many in it who struggle with food insecurity. Happy customers, satisfied with our food, could pay their joy forward by purchasing future meals for those in our community who may be less fortunate.",
      "Everyone deserves a good wholesome bowl lovingly filled with broth, noodles and amazing toppings!",

      "With the finest ingredients, patrons can come and enjoy a no nonsense bowl of ramen for not a lot of money.",
      "The menu, upon opening, will consist of 2 types of broth,  a pork base and a miso base. Our noodles will be alkaline based as is the standard. A rice noodle option will be available upon request.",
      "The choices of toppings consist of ajitama or ramen eggs, chashu or marinated roast pork, fresh spring onions and other vegetables, garlic, chili oil, etc. Customers can choose from a limited number of the options with add ons available, allowing for a different bowl of ramen for each customer, each time they return.",
      "Whether out alone, with friends or loved ones; a quick bowl of ramen hits the spot. The time between seating and serving should be about 5 to 10 minutes.",

I had to get the water boiling and pulled it into the bag very carefully. Besides, I had to take it very carefully to avoid getting burned as the hot water bag is very hot at the beginning. But it will become cold after some time. And the hot water bag is very heavy for me to carry. All these problems are gone when I found Seedze! It is so convenient and easy to use! Just power on it and it provides stable temperature heat. It\u2019s very light-weighted and I can wear it everywhere. Also Seedze provides aroma-patches at the same time.

      "We\u2019re building more than just an app. We\u2019re crafting a next-generation social experience where creators, entrepreneurs, and shoppers come together to showcase, sell, and discover products through engaging video content. It\u2019s fast, intuitive, and designed for the modern digital economy.",
      "In today\u2019s fast-paced digital world, attention spans are short, and user expectations are higher than ever. Consumers crave engaging content, instant gratification, and personalized experiences. At the same time, creators and small businesses are seeking platforms that not only give them visibility but also provide tools to convert that visibility into real, measurable growth.",
      "That\u2019s where Aweessomee comes in.",
      "Our platform isn\u2019t just about passive viewing\u2014it\u2019s about active participation.

Whether you're a small business owner showcasing handmade goods, a fashion influencer offering curated collections, or a viewer looking for exciting new finds, Aweessomee delivers an experience tailored for you.",
      "We're redefining the way people connect with products online by transforming everyday browsing into an entertaining, immersive, and rewarding experience. Users no longer have to jump between apps or search endlessly to find the items they saw in a video. With Aweessomee, the product is just a click away\u2014right there, in the moment, while the excitement is still fresh.",
      "Imagine a space where creativity meets commerce and where social interaction fuels business success. That\u2019s the vision of Aweessomee. And with your support, we're bringing that vision to life\u2014one scroll, one creator, and one connection at a time.",
      "This isn\u2019t just another app; this is a movement. A movement toward smarter shopping, empowered creators, and a vibrant community of buyers and sellers working together to shape the future of digital commerce.",
      "Current short-video platforms captivate billions but fail to turn that attention into direct sales. At the same time, traditional e-commerce platforms offer functionality but lack excitement and engagement. This disconnect results in lost opportunities for creators, friction for buyers, and an outdated online shopping experience.",
      "Sellers are forced to juggle multiple platforms just to get a sale. Viewers interested in a product must leave the app, navigate third-party sites, and complete transactions elsewhere \u2014 a process that often leads to cart abandonment and lost revenue.",

      "By integrating e-commerce directly into the content feed, we reduce buyer hesitation, increase conversion rates, and create viral opportunities for creators and brands alike.",
      "Unlike platforms that require users to click external links or exit the app to complete a purchase, Aweessomee keeps the entire shopping journey in one place. This results in higher engagement, fewer drop-offs, and more satisfied users.",
      "We are seeking $5,000,000 to build, launch, and grow the Aweessomee platform. Every contribution will help us move from our prototype stage to a full national launch, ensuring we meet development, marketing, and operational goals.",

      "User adoption can be unpredictable, but our aggressive, creator-focused marketing plan is designed to drive early traction and momentum.",

    "company_name": "AUKSON INC",

      "Looseness and relaxation anywhere you go. It's possible!",
      "Gamers and people who work on a computer all day long know how tired and stressed the wrist can get after a few hours of activity, let alone a full day. As common as this experience is, and as widespread as stress has become, there has been no solution to this problem.",
      "WrisLax is the first wearable device of its kind, building a new level of convenience into wrist massages. Unlike other massagers, which force you to stop doing what you are doing in order to use them, WrisLax works while you are playing games or typing on your keyboard.",
      "Sore joints, carpal tunnel, finger numbness, and any other stresses: WrisLax can help you. One of the reasons WrisLax is so effective is its electrical muscle stimulation (EMS), a low-frequency pulse that uses current to stimulate muscle contraction.",
      "This, combined with a traditional vibration massage, deliver the relief that you crave \u2013 all day long!This is a highly effective innovation, sure to keep your wrist loose and relaxed, applying safe but impactful electrical muscles to your muscle in order to elicit responses from them and work out any tightness.",
      "A SLEEPING HELPER AS WELL",
      "Through the ultra-low pulse massage \"Nei Guan Point\", not only can play a tranquilizing effect but also can effectively stimulate the secretion of neurotransmitters. This can relieve insomnia and help to sleep better.  Wrislax has an Ultra-low frequency pulses mode which can boost \u0398/THETA brain waves. By transmitting it to the brain through the hands, it can rescue insomnia and anxiety.",
      "Stimulates Neurotransmitter Secretion.",
      "Transcranial microcurrent can enhance theta brain waves in the brain, enhance the secretion of neurotransmitters, purely physical action, help to fall asleep quickly, and get healthy, quality sleep.",
      "As a wearable, WrisLax affords you the freedom that other massagers do not. You can take it anywhere you go, traveling far and wide. For the on-the-go professional, and for the gamer traveling from one gaming venue to another, out of your living room and into your nearest esports stadium and back again, this is a degree of portability that is unheard of in the market for massagers.",
      "It is even more than powerful, though. WrisLax is also convenient. You can turn the strap inside out, for a mobile, miniature massager you can apply it anywhere on your body. Although it looks small, it is incredibly powerful, making an impact so that you can let go, breathe deeply, and live the happy, carefree life you have imagined for yourself.",
      "* The strap, although effective at keeping WrisLax in place, is simultaneously flexible and comfortable as well. You may even forget you're wearing it \u2013 right up until you turn it back on and start enjoying the vibration again!",
      "* A light that will let you know which mode you are using and when its battery is low, flashing red three times before it goes out.",
      "* A sleek, minimalist style means that it is not only a practical wearable but a fashionable accessory too.",
      "Right now, we are looking to raise the funds that we need to manufacture, market, and distribute WrisLax on a large scale. Our goal through this campaign is $5000. To reach that goal, we are pre-selling our groundbreaking wearable massager to you before we offer it anywhere else.",
      "As an added thank-you, we will also be offering WrisLax at a discount, exclusively through this campaign, shipped within two months after the campaign ends. We are also offering some add-ons, including medical cold compresses and replaceable straps.",
      "Pre-order now and get your WrisLax. Your wrists will love you for it!",
      "WHAT WE HAVE DONE TILL NOW",
      "To date, we have put substantial work into engineering a world-class wearable. We have worked off of a revolutionary design and partnered with experts in production. We are ready to follow through on this launch. If we need to delay our timeline for any reason, we will be sure to send out an update. You can count on us to remain transparent throughout this process.",

      "Every backer will get their exclusive life membership card when we reach the stretch goal.The card will be upgraded automatically according to the final funding of the campaign.Learn more at the update #4.",
      "Breeze II has great spec compared to most of the board on the market. As mentioned in the video, it can travel 15 miles in medium mode, climb up to a 30% hill and reach up to 28 miles per hour. The chart below compares Breeze II with one of the most famous electric skateboards in the industry. Even without the factor of such a big price difference, Breeze II still has advantages on the data listed.",
      "On Breeze II, hub motor is chosen over belt motor for several reasons. As most electric skateboard users know, belt motor can provide more torque which can generate higher acceleration. However, belt motor needs frequent maintenance and makes loud noise during cruising. The hub motors are quieter and more energy efficient.",
      "Those motors on Breeze II are also swappable. When the outside layer wears out, you can easily change it without changing the entire motor which is much more expensive. We also include a different size spare pair of wheels in the package.",
      "For battery case and ESC case, we choose aluminum alloy to provide well crashworthiness and heat dissipation. The swappable function makes it easy to change the battery after the battery life ends. On the other hand, it also makes it possible to travel in longer distance if you carry a back-up battery during your trip.",
      "Battery is one of the most importance parts of an electric skateboard. We select high quality Samsung battery which has 1000 cycles battery life. This means you can use up the battery 1000 times but still has most capacity of your battery. In addition, the Samsung battery can bear extreme weather. Breeze II can still function from -4\u00b0F to 140\u00b0F.",
      "The deck of a skateboard can have huge influence on your riding experience. Breeze II\u2019s deck is made of bamboo and two layers of glass fiber which make the deck three times more expensive than Canada maple deck. The combination makes a balance between flexibility and strength. The shape of the deck is designed for more comfort and stability.",
      "In order to prevent water damage commonly seen on our previous boards. We enhance the waterproof level on Breeze II. It has one of the best waterproof features in the market, which reaches IP67. You can immerse the board entirely in water for short time period without damage it.",
      "We add in slide start function considering most skater used to slide start the normal skateboard. After couple steps of sliding, the board will automatically turn on.",
      "Hardness of brake setting has always been tricky to decide. Since people have different braking habits, a single level braking can cause bad cruising experience and even injury. Breeze II has 4 brake settings from soft to strong. You can adjust the setting directly on the remote control during your ride.",
      "By pressing the LED button on the remote control during cruise, your can cruise at the same speed you currently at. This function can make long distance trips much easier. You can stop the cruise control by braking at any moment.",
      "Breeze II has two built in tail lights which will flash when you are braking.",
      "By braking on downhill, you can charge your board during the trip.",
      "We have shipped the first batch of Breeze II to our early bird backers. The second batch is in transit to our US and Europe warehouse now. We will arrange the shipment once they arrive.",

      "Because what\u2019s the difference?",
      "Why do we need to buy three bra tops for a single day of activities?",
      "Why is it ok to post a picture of yourself in your bikini but not your underwear?",
      "We think underwear should empower you, not limit you\u2026",
      "So we created SOMI:",
      "The breathable underwear that moves with you...",
      "Because we\u2019re always moving!",
      "We\u2019re jumping in the pool, or hitting the trail, or getting in a quick yoga session.",
      "And we shouldn\u2019t have to constantly change our undies to fit the occasion.",
      "Or worse, have to skip out on activities because we don\u2019t have a swimsuit, or a sports bra, or a change of underwear.",
      "SOMI is the three-in-one solution that\u2019s made from a sustainable version of Silk Jersey fabric. It\u2019s breathable, antibacterial, moisture-wicking, quick-drying, supportive, comfortable, and always ready for your next activity. And that\u2019s the way underwear should be!",
      "So, seriously...what is the difference?",
      "What sets a swimsuit apart from a set of undies?",
      "And what makes SOMI a category apart?",
      "Well, swimsuits are generally made of cheap materials. They aren\u2019t concerned with comfort, they aren\u2019t meant to be worn close to the skin for extended periods of time, and they tend to feature:",
      "What about traditional underwear? It\u2019s made from delicate, fragile lace that you have to wash carefully, and it\u2019s much easier to tear. Or it\u2019s a five-pack of cotton undies\u2014generic, water-absorbent, and destined to show wear within a few washes.",
      "In the eco-conscious category, you can forget style and sexiness. It\u2019s utilitarian, rugged, and often oddly shapeless.",
      "SOMI bridges this gap with stylish, comfortable, versatile classics made from an eco-friendly fabric that washes like a dream.",
      "We\u2019ve always loved the idea of minimalism, but we wanted to offer our SOMI wearers the best of everything: The best workout underwear, the best swimwear, the best \u201cI-just-want-to-be-comfortable-and-lounge-around-in-my-undies\u201d wear. But how could we do that while still maintaining an eco-positive, minimalistic approach?",
      "The answer was simple: Create one functional (yet fashionable) set of undies that does it all.",
      "And make it durable enough to last for years to reduce your carbon footprint.",

      "Lounge",
      "Did you know that fashion is a major contributor to pollution? In fact, 140 million pounds of clothes end up in landfills each year, and 20% of industrial water pollution is estimated to come from garment manufacturing.",
      "We care about the world we live in, so designing SOMI to be eco-friendly and ethically made wasn\u2019t a decision we had to think twice about.",
      "What took a lot longer was coming up with an eco-conscious fabric that offered the water-resistance we needed, combined with the comfort we couldn\u2019t live without.",
      "We partnered with a supplier of some of the best athletic and swimwear brands in the world, and we worked with them to develop a new antibacterial fabric that would hold up even better in the gym and on the road\u2014anywhere you\u2019re likely to sweat.",
      "The result was SustainLuxe: A material comparable to a sustainable version of Silk Jersey in its softness, flexibility, strength, and sheen\u2014yet sustainably made and eco-friendly. And it's even constructed for maximum breathability so you stay comfortable no matter the activity.",
      "SustainLuxe is:",
      "Best of all, SustainLuxe:",
      "But we didn\u2019t stop there, because we wanted SOMI to be ethically made as well as eco-friendly. To this end, we\u2019ve taken careful measures to vet all our suppliers to ensure their workers are treated fairly.",
      "SOMI wearers are practical, adventurous, and always ready to sweat\u2014so we knew we had to make SOMI as resilient as they are.",
      "It had to be durable, long-lasting, and ready to stand up to the wear and tear of a life well-lived.",
      "It had to be easy to care for.",
      "And above all, it had to be ready to go at a moment\u2019s notice.",
      "That\u2019s why SOMI is:",
      "All of our designs feature silky, breathable Sustainluxe fabric and are engineered to be supportive for low impact workouts like yoga and pilates. Our four-way stretch movement will keep you feeling comfortable day and night, and you\u2019ll feel fresh for longer with antibacterial properties designed to last for up to 50 washes.",
      "Our bra band and waistband elastic is sourced from a luxury supplier. Since we\u2019re selling directly to you, we can afford to add this expensive detail: It\u2019s thin enough to not add bulk, but thick enough to give you the support you need.",
      "Our favorite part of this elastic is the hand feel. It feels as soft and silky as buttered kittens, and it doesn\u2019t have that super shiny \u201cI\u2019m lingerie!\u201d finish; instead, it\u2019s a subtle sheen that lasts through grueling wash after wash.",
      "To effectively manage resources, we are offering our designs \u2014all in black.",
      "We tested SOMI on 243 women, sampled over 100 fabrics, and examined 50 bra band elastics before bringing our venture to crowdfunding. Why? Because we wanted SOMI to be perfect in every way\u2014and we knew the only way to achieve that was by paying attention to the little details, then getting real feedback from the people who matter.",

      "It\u2019s all three.",
      "Here\u2019s how SOMI compares to the status quo:",
      "Because our SOMI bra tops are designed with super-stretchy double-lined fabric, we recommend choosing your size based on your band measurement rather than your cup size. If in doubt, size down!",
      "Please note that some styles are only available in certain sizes, so make sure to look at the size availability when picking your preferred look.",
      "It started with an email.",
      "\u201cHey,\u201d it said. \u201cCan I wear this underwear in the water? Like a bikini?\u201d",
      "At this point, SOMI was just a vision and a website.",
      "We thought about it. What was the difference between underwear and swimwear, really? Our test line was already made from quick-dry fabric with sporty accents.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t see why not,\u201d we wrote back.",
      "Two days later, she sent a photo wearing her SOMI effortlessly in the water.",
      "Then we got another photo.",
      "And another.",
      "Different women smiling and wearing their underwear proudly for everything from home workouts to hikes.",
      "And there was one hiker who did a week-long trip with only SOMI, wore it as a swimsuit, and washed it in the sink at night.",

      "A traditional whistle produces a monotone high pitched sound to grab attention from the rescuer. However, a monotone sound can easily get lost in the wind. The GP1945 pen is integrated with a loud, up to 100 dB PRO whistle which is uniquely designed to produce a variety of tones to attract.",

More CONTACT surface notch to your pocket or notebook. 5. Two different heights to catch different thickness edges TIGHTLY. 6. Thickness INCREASED.",

      "An umbrella for the hero in us all, complete with state-of-the-art special effects.",
      "Like the best of science fiction, Rainsaber started with a whatif. What if you combined an umbrella with state-of-the-art saber effects? Wonder no more. Behold!",
      "Most sabers on the market today are inaccessible to the average enthusiast. Machined from high-grade aluminum and hand-built by masters, they can run upwards of several hundred, even thousands of dollars. By 3D printing our hilts from the strongest materials on the market and reinforcing them with carbon fiber, we make iconic hilt designs rugged and affordable.",
      "To create that special saber experience, we packed the umbrella stem with over 200 crazy bright LEDs. The high-speed microprocessor in every RGB diode enables the scrolling and clash effects, but also instant color change with the push of a button. Not just the classic red, green, and blue, either, but any hue you can imagine. Our white umbrella canopy illuminates these effects.",
      "The electronic components that power Rainsaber have been optimized for special effects--high-end audio drivers, accelerometers, a 28 mm speaker, studio-quality sound effects, and more--but they aren't cheap. By ordering in bulk from suppliers, we can reduce these costs and pass them on to you.",
      "But even the best umbrellas break. (We've tested quite a few.) With that in mind, we designed Rainsaber with a modular repair system. If a gust of wind takes your umbrella by surprise or an LED burns out, you can replace the blade and canopy at a reasonable cost. This gives Rainsaber several distinct advantages over any other umbrella on the market: 1) it reduces the lifelong cost of the product; 2) it cuts down on environmental waste; 3) it makes your umbrella a stand-alone saber for that costume party or convention.",
      "Right now we offer three adult-sized handles in recognizable designs, but several more hilts are already in development. In the style of classic umbrellas available everywhere, the canopies stretch 40\" when opened. A child-sized hilt and canopy is in the works, too.",
      "Back us now to join the battle against the elements!",

      "November -- Packaging and shipping",
      "December -- All rewards delivered!",
      "ABOUT US: Rainsaber was born on a rainy day in NYC in 2016, when we realized the simple umbrella in our hand could serve another purpose--as a weapon against galactic tyranny. After testing multiple materials and designs over the next two years, we settled on the products you see here.",
      "Right now we have everything we need to fulfill small orders--our suppliers wait on stand-by with invoices at the ready. Our manufacturing partners are hungry for work.

      "We here at Rainsaber are crowd-funding superbackers ourselves. Rest assured, we prize quality. We belong to a thriving saber community that values craftsmanship, integrity, and openness. We pledge to use your support responsibly to deliver the product we promised.",
      "As with any new enterprise, we expect frustrations and hiccups along the way. In the development process alone we encountered manufacturing mistakes, factory-shutting holidays, unavailability of parts and supplies, steep learning curves, and the daily woes of the trial-and-error engineering process. Good news for you is that we have already troubleshot known design issues.",
      "That said, with more funding we can continue to improve the Rainsaber experience by fine-tuning things like the blade color customization interface, adding a rumble motor, and perfecting the speaker enclosure to create the magical saber experience we've always craved. As we gear up for mass production, we expect that this process might also drive design changes unforeseen on the boutique scale. We will be upfront with you about any modifications that affect your reward to keep our expectations aligned.",
      "We aim to build your Rainsaber right here in NYC. This makes positive contributions to our community and allows us to keep doing what we love--building sabers. However, we are still navigating the labyrinth of city business and manufacturing regulations. We will keep you apprised of any issues that arise and will adjust accordingly to keep our delivery date on track.",
      "SPECIAL THANKS -- We appreciate the help from the supporters that made Rainsaber possible: Plecter Labs; Fredrik Hubinette; Saber Fonts; Roman Props; Ivan Mihaljevic; Vincent Lo; The Custom Saber Shop; thexter, danlim, and all the other good folks at The Rebel Armory, and finally, all our friends and family (you know who you are).",
