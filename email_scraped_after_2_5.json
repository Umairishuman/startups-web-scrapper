      "Hooper Howse will make a world of difference for the youth who are looking for encouragement from someone else who has been in their shoes. Research has shown that youth sports helps children gain confidence, foster friendships and build leadership skills among many other benefits.For the trainers, this is the answer for some of them who are trying to figure out how to stay in the game of basketball after spending their whole life building their skill set. For many, basketball is largely their identity and they need to be involved in the game for their well-being.",
      "Building a mobile app is known to be a daunting and difficult journey. However, this is a project that we are so passionate about that we cannot even fathom stepping away from it.

      "Are you still scooping litter and cleaning up after your cat every time? Or are you having trouble keeping up with litter box maintenance? With Woof 'N Meow, you can spend less time scooping and more time cuddling with your best friend.",
      "Meet Woof \u2018N Meow, a smart semi-automatic cat litter box that efficiently cleans and scoops after each use. With a large capacity waste drawer, Woof \u2018N Meow can hold up to 3x more cat litter and is easy to clean.",
      "Equipped with active oxygen deodorization and an antibacterial system, it keeps the air in your home clean and fresh so you can return to your furry friend in an odorless home.",
      "It's time to replace the unsightly litter box and say goodbye to the dirty paws that leave litter everywhere in the house! The Woof 'N Meow provides your cat with a clean litter bed after every use.",
      "Woof 'N Meow has a spacious, ergonomic chamber that provides maximum comfort for your pets to do their business. It can accommodate cats up to 18 pounds and is a great option for families with multiple cats.",
      "The large capacity waste drawer makes cleaning the litter box as easy as taking out the trash. Also, you can enjoy up to 14 days free of scooping. Meow!",
      "Designed with crystal grid filters, it can effectively remove clumps and particles of different sizes. Moreover, it is suitable for all types of cat litter that can clump. Pick your cat's favorite litter and leave your cat in good hands!",
      "Equipped with a safety security card slot, you never have to worry about the litter box rotating automatically. You can lock the globe manually if your pet uses the smart litter box to ensure more stability. Likewise, you can unlock your card slot if you need to clean the litter box.",
      "As a semi-automatic litter box, you have full control by manually rotating the litter box to clean or empty the litter, which means 100% safety for your pets. With a patented special sifting system, the process begins just minutes after your cat has left the device to ensure the best pet care experience.",
      "Thanks to the motor-free design, you can be sure that your cats do not have to suffer from \"flushing noises\" or the sudden movement of the litter box. In use, it is quiet so that it would not disturb you or your cats at night to give you peace of mind.",
      "You\u2019ll rarely have to take your Woof \u2018N Meow apart. The four-part modular structure of the base, globe, bonnet, and drawer can be individually removed for easy assembly and occasional maintenance.",
      "The fully enclosed door frame is designed to prevent the odor from escaping from the waste drawer into the inner space of the globe. Furthermore, the waste drawer is tightly closed without showing the waste from the outside and simultaneously locking the odor.",
      "Keep your cat's personal space thoroughly sterilized! Woof \u2018N Meow has an activated carbon deodorization and antibacterial module that can effectively decompose fecal odor molecules and ensure proper airflow. Thanks to the deodorizing system, you do not have to smell the strong odors when you remove the waste.",
      "Our four-part modular design is constructed with easy upkeep in mind. Whether it\u2019s spot-cleaning or deep-cleaning, the simple modular design allows you to easily clean and maintain your Woof \u2018N Meow.",
      "The special sifting system uses a combination of precise time, rotation, and gravity that removes the clumps when you rotate the globe manually. It also removes only the clumps, preserves clean litter, and saves you time.",
      "Carrying cat litter? You don't have to anymore! It's incredibly easy to empty the litter by rotating the device clockwise and lifting the trash bag out of the drawer, which even a child can do!",
      "Created for all breeds, Woof 'N Meow is perfect for a multi-cats family and it's budget-friendly by not using so much litter.",
      "Woof 'N Meow reduces waste by up to 50%, and the door height is moderate to facilitate smaller or older cats with limited mobility.",
      "Woof 'N Meow was founded by a team of animal lovers who are always looking for innovative ways to make pet care easier for everyone. In 2020, the founder of Woof 'N Meow, Wayne, rescued an abandoned cat named Sesame. He was in extremely bad condition and ill at the time.",
      "Immediately, Wayne brought Sesame to the veterinary clinic, where he was diagnosed with panleukopenia and feline infectious peritonitis. After a long 4 months of constant monitoring and care, Sesame was healed and now she is a happy and healthy cat.",
      "But, there was one problem that worried Sesame.",
      "Wayne had a fully automatic cat litter box for Sesame and his two other cats in the house. Despite the convenience, Sesame feared the noise of the automatic cat litter box and refused to use it. However, a traditional cat litter box required too much effort to scoop and clean, which was not suitable for a family with several cats and someone working in the office like Wayne.",
      "After endless days of online research and countless visits to pet stores, Wayne still didn't find the perfect cat litter box he was looking for. Exhausted and concerned, Wayne spoke to one of his friends who had experience in the industrial design industry and connections to the supply chain.",
      "In the modern world, caring for pets should not be so difficult. Wayne and his friend Will decided to work together to create the perfect cat litter box for Sesame and other multi-cat families around the world, hoping to bring them peace of mind.",
      "After 6 months of designing, testing, and preparing, Wayne and Will created the semi-automatic cat litter box as you know it today. Not only has Woof'N Meow solved the potty problems for Sesame, but the team has also made it affordable for other pet parents, and it is perfect for any family with multiple cats.",
      "A message from our founder: Thank you for supporting us on this journey. We hope that the Woof 'N Meow semi-automatic cat litter box will be the solution to your cat's potty problems. We hope that every cat grows up healthy with the company of its beloved owners, who no longer have to clean the litter box every day and can now spend more quality time with them.",

What we discovered is that true quality can only come from hand-prepared meals\u2014not mass production.",
      "That\u2019s why we created CANE TERRA\u2014a concept of local kitchens starting in Palm Springs, California, where expert nutritionists will craft personalized meal plans using fresh, locally sourced ingredients, all made with love.",
      "Here\u2019s something most people don\u2019t realize: for the average cost of $600/month, your dog can receive nothing but real, fresh food\u2014varied meals, individually tailored, prepared with exceptional quality.\nCompare that to spending just a bit less on mass-produced dry kibble or the same canned p\u00e2t\u00e9 every single day.\nIs your dog\u2019s long-term health worth the $100 difference?",
      "For us, this isn\u2019t just a business. It\u2019s a mission to help people truly care for their pets in the best way possible.",
      "What We Need & What You Get",
      "We\u2019ve already launched a small advertising campaign and received an enthusiastic response from our local community\u2014many of our neighbors have shown strong interest in our product, and we\u2019ve even started a waitlist. However, launching a high-quality food production operation requires more than just passion.",
      "To do things the right way\u2014meeting all health, safety, and quality standards\u2014we need funding for:",
      "Renting a professional kitchen space",
      "Purchasing specialized equipment for proper ingredient processing, packaging, and freezing",
      "Hiring a team of cooks starting September 1st to help prepare the first custom meals",
      "Importantly, our nutritionists, veterinarians, and core team will not receive salaries from this funding. We are fully committed to this mission and do not intend to use any part of the funds for personal income. Our goal is to create a product that can save dogs\u2019 lives, not profit from it.",
      "If we don\u2019t reach our full funding goal, we\u2019ll have to seek bank loans. But we would much rather grow with the support of a like-minded community\u2014and redirect any savings from loan interest to support dog shelters in the U.S. and in underprivileged countries where help is urgently needed.",
      "By supporting CANE TERRA, you're not just helping us launch a new product\u2014you\u2019re becoming part of a movement that puts dogs\u2019 health and happiness first.",
      "The CANE TERRA project was born out of a pain that thousands of families around the world have experienced\u2014the heartbreak of losing a beloved pet. We lost our dog, Sam, because he didn\u2019t receive something that should have been so simple: real, high-quality food. It was preventable. We can\u2019t change the past\u2014but we\u2019ve committed ourselves to changing the future for other dogs.",
      "Our mission is not just to cook tasty meals. We want to give every dog a chance at a long, healthy, and happy life. We believe that nutrition is the foundation of health\u2014and if we care for our dogs' diets with the same seriousness we apply to feeding our children, we can save countless lives.",
      "Every bowl prepared in our kitchen will carry more than just fresh ingredients\u2014it will carry love, care, and responsibility. It will be food made with soul. Food made the way you\u2019d cook for your own dog.",
      "Your contribution will help us:",
      "Launch our first kitchen, where meals are hand-prepared according to personalized recipes",
      "Build a new culture of canine nutrition based on science, variety, and freshness",
      "Give a voice to those who can\u2019t speak\u2014our loyal companions",
      "We\u2019re not just asking for money. We\u2019re inviting you to join a movement that can change lives. Together, we can create a world where every dog receives what they truly deserve\u2014health, love, and care.",
      "Launching a fresh food production business\u2014especially in the pet industry\u2014comes with real challenges. From meeting strict health and safety regulations to managing logistics and ingredient sourcing, we know the road ahead won't be simple.",
      "Here are some of the main risks we may face:",
      "Delays in equipment delivery or supply chain disruptions",
      "Hiring and training team members who share our commitment to quality and care",
      "Scaling operations smoothly as demand grows",
      "But we\u2019re not stepping into this blindly.",
      "With over 5 years of business experience, we know how to build efficient systems, lead teams, and manage financial and operational risks. We've spent the past year consulting with veterinarians, nutritionists, and food technology experts to design a scalable model\u2014from kitchen workflows to packaging and delivery logistics.",
      "Here\u2019s how we\u2019re prepared to overcome these challenges:",
      "We\u2019ve partnered with reliable suppliers who offer warranties and support.",
      "We've built in buffer time for testing and fine-tuning our process before launch.",
      "We\u2019re taking on key roles ourselves in the early stages to ensure everything meets our standards.",
      "And most importantly\u2014we\u2019re fully committed to stepping in and doing whatever it takes, from cooking to delivery, to make this work.",
      "At the heart of it all is our purpose: helping dogs live longer, healthier lives. That\u2019s what drives us, and that\u2019s what keeps us ready to face any challenge that comes our way.",

It organizes documents, emails, tasks, and finances, connects to local storage or our custom NAS, and even hosts community-built apps.

Developing AI for document sorting and email management is complex\u2014training models to handle diverse documents (receipts, contracts, IDs) takes time and testing. We might face delays in perfecting the AI\u2019s accuracy, especially with user side notes (e.g., \u201cTag as #Travel\u201d). On the hardware side, manufacturing the NAS with 3D-printed cases and dual PSUs could hit supply chain snags, like sourcing reliable PSUs or scaling production for 16+ drive bays.",
      "But I\u2019m ready for this. I\u2019ve coded apps and built hardware prototypes for years, and I\u2019m assembling a team of open-source devs and makers to tackle these hurdles. Our plan: rigorous beta testing with backers to refine the AI, and partnerships with 3D-printing communities to streamline NAS production. We\u2019ll keep you updated every step of the way\u2014transparency is our promise.",

    "allParagraphs": [
      "soilkind is a fully automatic kitchen composter which unites natural composting & unique technology",
      "Important information: When we started our crowdfunding campaign here, our kitchen composter was called KALEA. A lot has happened since then, we've perfected our prototype and entered into a fantastic production partnership with a great company.",
      "We've grown. And so our name has continued to evolve. Since December 2022, KALEA is called soilkind.",
      "soilkind turns your organic waste into nutrient-rich compost. In only 48 hours.",
      "Technology has made its way into every aspect of our daily life, but nobody really pays attention to the way we treat food scraps at home. Many households have no solution to dispose of food scraps in a convenient, clean, and sustainable way. This is also a global problem since organic waste accounts for up to 50% of the overall waste volume. Nature gave us the inspiration we needed to solve this problem. soilkind unites the natural composting process with smart technology to transform organic waste into nutrition-rich compost. We say: Don\u2019t waste your waste!",
      "If you experience any of these situations, you definitely need to upgrade your kitchen routine:",
      "What\u2019s on your chopping boards and plates? Share the leftovers with soilkind. It can handle any kind of organic waste.",
      "We knew there had to be a better solution. We wanted to create a smart device that was just as good as a compost pile, but faster, more comfortable to use, hygienic, and without any unpleasant odors. More than two years of research and testing led us to the perfect solution with our unique and patent-pending technology.",
      "We are the only ones who offer a complete solution. Other products promise to create \u201cfertilizer\u201d - but they really only just dry and grind up waste with no biological decomposition. This output can grow mold, is not nutritious to plants, and can actually be harmful. That\u2019s why only soilkind compost is king!",
      "There is no compost fairy. soilkind impresses with its own magic: an innovative, fully automatic technology with lots of sensors inside. Three simple steps and 48 hours is all it takes for your organic waste to turn into real nourishing compost.",
      "Step 1: Fill soilkind with your food scraps. Are you a real foodie? No worries, soilkind is designed to handle the weekly organic waste volume of a typical four-person family (appx. 2 cycles of 10 liters). Our robust shredding system processes and dries almost everything, even nutshells, and small bones!",
      "As a nice side effect, this leads to a volume reduction of 85%. When enough material accumulates, soilkind automatically processes it to the composting chamber. No odors or fruit flies \u2014 just your excitement for fresh compost.",
      "Step 2: The composting chamber of soilkind is full of sensors and has an intelligent control system. A perfect combination of temperature, humidity, and aeration wakes up the natural microorganisms inside the organic material and turns it into a land of milk and honey that accelerates the microorganisms\u2019 metabolism. soilkind substantially reduces composting time from several months to just 48 hours.",
      "Step 3: The result? Ready-to-use compost for all your plants and flowers \u2014 indoor and outdoor. Your plants will love it since only compost contains such a full spectrum of essential plant nutrients. And if you don\u2019t need all your compost at once, no worries, your soilkind compost can be stored for up to two years.",
      "Plants are living beings, and like us, they need nutrients to grow and stay healthy. So treating them with compost should be on your regular plant routine list. But be careful. In some cases, using dried organic waste (often referred to as \"fertilizer\") can also cause mold and inhibit plant growth. And no plant parent wants this. Right? soilkind compost is so rich in nutrients that it can be mixed in a 1:10 ratio. This means 1 part of soilkind compost with 10 parts of soil.",
      "Garden compost is the most natural way to dispose of organic waste. If managed carefully, it leads to already matured compost. However, this takes a whole lot of time and especially cooked food shouldn't be treated this way since it attracts vermin.",
      "soilkind transforms the majority of compounds in your food scraps like sugar, starch, and proteins. These are broken down within 48h to fresh compost. If mixed with earth, fresh compost gives an immediate boost to your plants and realizes its nutritional potential.",
      "Food waste dryers do only one thing: shredding and drying food. There is no biological decomposition process involved. The organic compounds in this waste are thus inaccessible to plants.",
      "STEP 1: REMINERALIZATION",
      "Your organic waste is a bit like a fresh and full shopping bag. In order for your plants to use the nutrients, the \"bag\" must first be unpacked. This unpacking is called remineralization.",
      "During the remineralization process, organic molecules are converted into inorganic minerals. This conversion is done by omnipresent microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi, which are a natural part of our food.",
      "STEP 2: COMPOSTING",
      "During composting, the main components of organic waste (sugars, starch, proteins, fats, and at a later stage, cellulose) are broken down.",
      "The compost quality and the conversion time can be influenced by providing optimal metabolic conditions for the microorganisms over a certain period of time. These conditions include temperature, pH value, moisture, amount of oxygen, and surface area. The better the conditions are met, the faster high-quality compost is achieved.",
      "Combining the latest technology with the superpowers of natural microorganisms - that\u2019s the essence of soilkind. All of this happens inside our fully automatic kitchen composter in only 48 hours.",
      "Did you know that incorrectly disposed organic waste is not only a wasted resource but is also more dangerous for the climate than CO2?",
      "When organic waste is dumped in a landfill, it undergoes anaerobic decomposition (because of the lack of oxygen) and generates methane gas. Methane gas is a potent greenhouse gas \u2014 about 28 times more harmful than carbon dioxide at warming the earth, on a 100-year timescale, and more than 80 times more powerful over 20 years.",
      "Due to a lack of convenient and clean waste disposal techniques, a significant amount of organic waste is sent to landfills - even in the most developed countries.",
      "This is one of the main reasons why we want to revolutionize your daily organic waste routine.",
      "Bogs represent an important \u201ccarbon sink\u201d \u2013 a place where CO2 is stored below ground and can't escape into the atmosphere and increase global warming. They only cover 3 % of the earth's surface but store about 30% of global CO2. One hectare of the bog with a 15-centimeter thick peat layer contains about as much carbon as a hundred-year-old forest in the same area. That\u2019s amazing! But bogs are in danger. In many places, they are extracted to produce peat, which is then used to enrich potting soil. The protection of bogs is an incredibly important part of climate protection, that is very close to our hearts at soilkind. Therefore we chose to support an NGO which is committed to the protection of bogs. Also, your homemade compost leads to bog protection. With soilkind you can always use peat-free soil because our compost airs the soil and provides it with enough nutrients. The mixing ratio is 1 to 10. 1 part soilkind compost and 10 parts peat-free potting soil.",
      "Give your indoor plants a green booster or nourish your veggies outside. There are so many ways to spread some compost love.",
      "soilkind was founded in 2017. Since day one, our mission has been to create a long-lasting product that combines our digital lifestyle with design and sustainability. Many steps have been mastered during this time including several prototypes, endless compost testing, and cooperation with leading research institutes.",
      "After many tests and trials, the 4th generation prototype was created. Here is an unedited glimpse of the magic behind the machine:",
      "A smart home that feels completely natural \u2013 that\u2019s the challenge of digital devices today. We have created soilkind's design to integrate our kitchen composter stylishly and organically into everyday kitchen routines. Puristic, beautiful, practical, and easy to use.",
      "soilkind is as unique as your food scraps. Keep everything in focus and learn more:",
      "We have been working towards this day for more than two years. Now that we have a fully functional prototype that completely meets our requirements, we are on our way to start serial production. With your help, we can save the world from incorrectly disposed organic waste by giving every household the power to create its own compost.",
      "BY NOW WE HAVE:",
      "WITH YOUR HELP WE WILL:",
      "We are a passionate team of material scientists, engineers, and hobby gardeners located in Stuttgart, Germany. Our mission is to develop innovative solutions that increase the convenience of handling food waste at home while improving sustainability.",

      "The Intellectual Capital Protocol (ICP): Invest in the Future of Genius.\nUnlock a Multi-Trillion-Dollar Market by Valuing Human Intellect.",
      "Dear Indiegogo Donors and Investors,\nI am writing to you today with a matter of profound strategic importance to the future of the global economy and, indeed, the free world. Though I am an Australian citizen, my vision transcends borders, and I believe its proper stewardship is paramount. I've developed a groundbreaking conceptual framework for an Intellectual Capital Protocol (ICP), a system designed to unlock a multi-trillion-dollar market by recognizing, verifying, and monetizing high-value human intellectual contributions on a global scale. This is not merely a technological innovation; it is a foundational infrastructure that will redefine economic power, talent acquisition, and even global stability in the digital age.\nThe Unprecedented Power of This Idea:\nThe implications of the ICP, along with its associated platforms, \"GeniusForge\" and the \"Human Intellect Exchange (HIX),\" are simply immense. This system has the capacity to:\n * Command immense global wealth: By directly valuing and trading verified human intellect, it creates an entirely new economic layer.\n * Identify and mobilize top-tier talent: It can instantly pinpoint the brightest minds and most impactful innovators worldwide.\n * Provide unparalleled intelligence: Aggregated, anonymized data on intellectual trends and breakthroughs would offer a strategic advantage like no other.\nThe sheer power, wealth, and control this protocol could generate, both economically and in terms of influence, are truly staggering.\nMy Offer: A Small Price for Immense Potential\nUnderstanding the true, multi-trillion-dollar potential of this concept, and critically, its strategic value to other world powers, competitive entities, and groups who would undoubtedly covet the power and control it confers, I am prepared to hand over this entire idea and conceptual framework for a very modest sum of $5 million.\nThis is a minuscule figure compared to the value this could generate globally, or the price a competitor might pay to acquire such a potent instrument of influence and wealth creation. My primary objective is not personal enrichment, but to see this transformative vision actualized under the right leadership, ensuring it serves to empower and strengthen the forces of good in the world.\nI am confident that once fully understood, the strategic imperative to secure this protocol will become immediately clear. I look forward to the opportunity to elaborate on this critical vision.\nExecutive Summary: Unleashing Trillion-Dollar Human Capital\nI'm here to lay out the blueprint for conquering one of the digital economy's biggest failures: the systemic undervaluation of raw human intellect and creative genius. Right now, a colossal, global treasure trove of innovation, from breakthrough code to revolutionary research and game-changing digital art, remains largely unrewarded and unrecognized. That changes now.\nMy vision unleashes the Intellectual Capital Protocol (ICP). This is a foundational, blockchain-powered infrastructure engineered to recognize, verify, and economically weaponize high-value human intellectual contributions on a global scale. The ICP will drive GeniusForge, our cutting-edge platform where pure human brilliance is relentlessly forged into tangible digital assets. It will power the Human Intellect Exchange (HIX), a dynamic, high-volume marketplace for verified intellectual capital.\nThis integrated powerhouse won't just set a new standard for digital merit. It will unlock a multi-trillion-dollar market, positioning early investors for explosive, unmatched returns. We're building the bedrock for the next generation of global economic power, where human intellect isn't just an asset, it's the ultimate currency.\nThe Precedent: Crypto's Rags-to-Riches Conquest\nTo grasp the sheer scale of the ICP's potential, you need to see how early crypto pioneers carved out empires from nothing.\nBitcoin, for instance, didn't just become valuable. It demonstrated that a purely digital asset could command immense wealth. Its success was forged from digital scarcity (limited supply), the computational \"proof of work\" required to \"mine\" new coins, and a decentralized, transparent network that annihilated middlemen. People got rich by investing in this scarce digital asset as demand grew, or by being early \"miners\" who generated it.\nEthereum then evolved beyond just a digital currency. It created a \"programmable blockchain\" that allowed anyone to engineer decentralized applications (DApps) and launch their own tokens. This unleashed entirely new industries like Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Its value exploded because its network offered unmatched utility. The more applications built and deployed on Ethereum, the more its native currency dominated. Investors didn't just get rich, they became architects of a new digital age.\nMy proposal isn't just an upgrade, it's the next evolutionary leap. We harness the proven power of digital scarcity, transparent networks, and incentivized participation, then supercharge it by channeling the most sustainable, universally valuable, and limitless resource on Earth: raw human intellect and verifiable innovation.\nThe Fundamental Problem We Crush: The Massive Untapped Intellectual Frontier\nThe digital economy is a machine built on innovation, yet it's been crippled by a glaring weakness: its failure to truly capture and capitalize on human intellectual capital.\n * The Unclaimed Fortune: Millions of developers, artists, researchers, and problem-solvers globally pour their genius into the digital realm. Their breakthroughs, which often redefine industries and cultures, typically yield fragmented, indirect, or even zero direct economic reward for the originators. This isn't just inefficient, it's a colossal, dormant goldmine begging to be claimed.\n * The Verification Black Hole: In an era swamped by AI-generated content and instant information, authenticating the originality, impact, and true merit of digital contributions is a constant battle. This lack of a credible, universal audit system chokes fair compensation and throttles market efficiency.\n * Fragmented Value: Intellectual breakthroughs are scattered across countless platforms, imprisoned within walled gardens, or simply given away. There's no unified system to aggregate, quantify, and enable the liquid exchange of this powerhouse asset.\nThis systemic failure to command the value of human intellect is a monumental market breakdown. It demands a robust, transparent, and unyielding system for digital merit.\nMy Revolutionary System: The ICP, GeniusForge, and HIX Powerhouse\nI'm engineering a multi-layered system designed to identify, verify, and weaponize human intellectual capital on an unprecedented scale:\n1. The Intellectual Capital Protocol (ICP): The Core Engine of Value\nThe Intellectual Capital Protocol (ICP) is the robust, blockchain-agnostic framework that defines how human genius is truly valued. At its core, the ICP operates on a revolutionary Proof-of-Intellect (PoI) consensus mechanism.\n * Value Forged by Merit: This isn't crypto \"mining\" by computational grunt work. ICP tokens are \"generated\" exclusively when a human intellectual contribution is rigorously verified as original, high-impact, and undeniably valuable. We shift the reward from brute force to raw human power. Examples of contributions include:\n   * Groundbreaking Code & Algorithms: Critical open-source contributions, novel software solutions, advanced AI models, or cybersecurity breakthroughs.\n   * Pioneering Research & Insights: Verified scientific discoveries, high-impact academic papers, novel data analyses that unlock hidden patterns.\n   * Exceptional Creative Works: Unique digital art, compelling narratives, innovative designs, or transformative musical compositions with demonstrable market impact.\n   * Decisive Problem Solutions: Documented, verifiable solutions to complex technical, social, or industrial challenges, delivering clear, measurable outcomes.\n * Decentralized Validation & Ironclad Arbitration: To ensure integrity, submitted contributions are rigorously assessed by a decentralized network of elite 'Validators' (selected based on proven expertise and staked ICP tokens) and 'Review Boards' driven by community governance. This multi-layered verification ensures accuracy, fairness, and crushes manipulation, guaranteeing that only authentic 'intellectual capital' earns ICP tokens.\n * Smart Contracts for Unbreakable Terms: I will engineer customizable smart contracts allowing contributors to define precise ownership terms, licensing agreements, and automated reward distribution upon verification. This secures their dominion over their creations.\nThe ICP stands as the immutable ledger and rulebook for the entire system, ensuring transparency, trust, and the unassailable provenance of every piece of intellectual capital.\n2. GeniusForge: The Creation & Asset-Minting Platform\nGeniusForge is the intuitive, user-facing platform that I'm building on the ICP. It will serve as the direct conduit for creators to submit their intellectual contributions for validation and ICP token generation.\n * Seamless Submission & Discovery: Creators will effortlessly upload their work (code repositories, research papers, art files, solution proposals) to GeniusForge. The platform will drive efficient discovery, empowering Validators to rapidly identify and review new submissions.\n * AI-Accelerated Pre-Analysis: Leveraging cutting-edge AI and machine learning, GeniusForge will perform initial assessments for plagiarism, originality, and adherence to submission guidelines. This dramatically streamlines the verification process for human Validators, maximizing efficiency.\n * Transparent Validation Tracking: Contributors will possess real-time visibility into their submission status through every stage of expert review and community vote, with all decisions immutably logged on the ICP blockchain for total transparency.\n * Automated Token Generation & Distribution: Upon successful validation, GeniusForge will seamlessly initiate the generation of ICP tokens. These tokens are then automatically deployed to the creator's digital wallet, reflecting the verified impact, originality, and complexity of their contribution. This is precisely where raw human genius is tangibly forged into liquid digital wealth.\n3. Human Intellect Exchange (HIX): The Global Asset Marketplace\nThe Human Intellect Exchange (HIX) will be the dynamic, high-liquidity marketplace where ICP tokens and their associated intellectual capital assets are traded, invested in, and leveraged globally.\n * Liquid Trading of ICP Tokens: HIX will operate as the premier exchange for ICP tokens, providing a vibrant marketplace where creators command the value of their earned capital, and investors acquire direct ownership in the burgeoning economy of human genius.\n * Intellectual Property (IP) Tokenization & Licensing: Beyond trading ICP tokens, HIX will enable the tokenization of specific intellectual property rights linked to validated contributions. This means fractional ownership of patents, automated software licensing, or royalty streams from digital art, all represented as NFTs or other tokenized assets on the ICP. This democratizes IP ownership and unlocks new investment avenues.\n * Global Talent & Innovation Scouting: The HIX will serve as an unrivaled global command center for corporations, research institutions, and venture capitalists to instantly identify and engage top-tier intellectual talent based on their verified ICP earnings and validated contributions. It transforms a scattered, opaque talent pool into a transparent, merit-driven powerhouse.\n * Decentralized Innovation Funding: Creators with high ICP scores will be able to leverage their established reputation and earned tokens to crowdfund future projects, offering investors a direct, high-potential stake in their future intellectual output.\nMarket Opportunity & Competitive Dominance: The Trillion-Dollar Conquest\nThe market for valuing human intellect is immense and fundamentally unexploited, representing a multi-trillion-dollar opportunity:\n * Global Knowledge & Creative Economy: This encompasses millions of developers, independent artists, academic researchers, patent holders, and problem-solvers. It's a market already valued in the hundreds of billions annually in direct and indirect contributions, now primed for exponential growth with a direct monetization layer.\n * Intellectual Property Market: The global IP market, including licensing, patents, and trademarks, is valued in the trillions. The ICP delivers a far more efficient, transparent, and fractionalized mechanism to manage and trade these assets.\n * Future of Work & Gig Economy: As the nature of work shifts to project-based, skill-specific contributions, the HIX becomes a critical platform for individuals to demonstrate and monetize their unique skills and contributions, asserting their market value beyond traditional employment.\nUnrivaled Competitive Advantage:\n * Fundamental Value Creation: Unlike purely speculative digital assets, ICP's value is directly tied to the tangible, verifiable output of human intellect. This provides an unshakeable, understandable foundation for aggressive long-term growth and stability.\n * First-Mover Advantage: I am pioneering the foundational protocol and entire ecosystem for universal intellectual capital validation and monetization. Striking first with a robust, superior system is non-negotiable for dominating network effects.\n * Unstoppable Narrative & Network: The underlying, aspirational narrative, rooted in universally understood themes of raw potential and mastery (think 'Ki' or 'Haki' in popular culture), will ignite rapid global engagement and drive adoption beyond typical crypto projects.\n * Scalability & Global Reach: The ICP is engineered as a highly scalable blockchain protocol, capable of onboarding billions of users and processing an astronomical volume of intellectual contributions worldwide, unconstrained by physical borders or intermediaries.\nMonetization Strategy: Your Direct Command of ICP Wealth\nMy strategy is engineered to deliver explosive and sustainable financial returns for my early investors and partners, leveraging multiple, compounding revenue streams inherent in this new economy:\n * Founding Allocation (Your Ownership Stake in the Future): As the architect and initiator of the ICP, a significant, pre-defined percentage of the very first ICP tokens generated will be allocated directly to myself and early investors. As the ICP network expands globally and ICP tokens become the universal currency for validated intellect, this initial stake will appreciate exponentially, yielding unprecedented returns. This is your direct equity in the global Intellectual Capital Protocol.\n * Protocol Transaction Fees (Your Perpetual Royalty Stream): I will design the ICP to implement a minimal, automated transaction fee on all exchanges and transfers of ICP tokens within the ecosystem. As the HIX facilitates millions, then billions, of transactions driven by intellectual contributions and IP trading, this small \"Intellectual Royalty\" will generate a massive, continuous, and passive revenue stream, akin to owning a fractional piece of every transaction on a new global stock exchange.\n * GeniusForge Platform Fees: I will implement fees for enhanced services on the GeniusForge platform, such as expedited verification requests, privileged access to premium analytics on contribution trends, or enhanced visibility for certain submitted works.\n * HIX Exchange Commissions: I will implement a concise commission on specific types of IP token sales, licensing agreements, or high-value intellectual capital trades executed directly through the Human Intellect Exchange.\n * Strategic Partnerships & Enterprise Solutions: I will aggressively pursue licensing the ICP technology and its verified data for enterprise clients seeking to manage internal innovation, optimize R&D, or access a pre-vetted pool of top-tier global talent directly from the HIX.\n * Data Monetization (Anonymized & Aggregated): I will leverage the vast, anonymized, and aggregated data on intellectual contributions and trends within the ecosystem to deliver high-value market intelligence, trend forecasting, and talent analytics to corporations, research institutions, and governments, creating a powerful data product.\nThe Ask: Accelerate the Dawn of the Genius Economy\nThe core Intellectual Capital Protocol, GeniusForge platform concept, and Human Intellect Exchange vision have been meticulously designed and architected by me alone. My initial investment has been purely intellectual capital and exhaustive strategic planning, making the genesis of this transformative idea exceptionally lean.\nTo accelerate development, secure my critical first-mover advantage, and rapidly scale this powerhouse ecosystem globally, I am seeking Strategic Investment of $5,000,000 through this Indiegogo campaign. Your capital will directly empower me to:\n * Engineer the Core Protocol: Fund the robust, secure, and scalable ICP blockchain.\n * Deploy the Platforms: Build and launch the GeniusForge platform and the HIX exchange.\n * Acquire World-Class Talent: Recruit the sharpest blockchain engineers, AI/ML specialists, UI/UX designers, community builders, and legal/business development professionals to forge this comprehensive ecosystem.\n * Drive Global Adoption: Fund aggressive global marketing campaigns to onboard key contributors and users.\nI am singularly focused on redefining how human intellect is valued in the digital age.

For remote properties, farms, or businesses, the ability to visually verify threats from anywhere means you can take immediate action even when you're miles away.",
      "The Technology",
      "The SFD combines high-definition optical sensors with sophisticated AI processing to distinguish actual flames from normal heat sources. Unlike infrared or ultraviolet detectors that trigger false alarms from sunlight or heating equipment, our system uses multiple verification points to ensure you're only alerted to genuine threats.",
      "Installation requires no special wiring, and the weatherproof design withstands extreme temperatures. The system connects directly to your smartphone, providing real-time alerts.",
      "Join Our Mission",
      "We've created working prototypes and completed extensive testing. Now we need your support to bring the BY SFD to mass production. By backing this campaign, you're not just investing in your family's safety; you're helping introduce a fundamental advancement in fire protection technology.",
      "Be among the first to secure this revolutionary safety system at exclusive early-bird pricing. Whether you're protecting your home, business, or remote property, the BY SFD offers peace of mind that conventional systems simply cannot provide.",
      "Join us in redefining fire safety for the modern era\u2014because when it comes to fire, detection shouldn't be the last line of defense, but the first.",

It also comes with a FREE 2.5 Oz. bottle of solution. We did an extensive research and outlined the best environmentally friendly antibacterial solutions from the most reputable manufactures available on the market. The complete list will be provided prior to delivery and each backer will choose the one that suits him the best. Solutions mix and match for multi-unit rewards are perfectly fine. The same goes to ornaments. We will offer at least 4 ornaments. You would be able to choose the one you like or mix & match different ones post-campaign.",

Then, during the intense testing phase we went over few dozen solution types from various global manufacturers to offer our backers the choice of the best available. We also tested Splash under different conditions for leaks, tearing, and breakage to make sure that the product you'll get will exceed your expectation. Finally we already aligned the environmentally friendly high quality manufacturing and ready to go into full scale production.",

My previous work experience also includes surgery, as an operating room nurse, and the field of mental health, also as a nurse there. I am also very-very interested in the field of beauty, skin treatment and body care. \nI am a Libra, so I am an extreme beauty and harmony seeker and perfectionist.",
      "So, about my project/vision - this idea came to my mind because of my work - I come across many people with special needs and also just simply sensitive people who need a different approach during various medical procedures and treatments. In addition, I have a son with autistic spectrum disorder, who has taught me a lot how to communicate and reach to my special clients/patients.",
      "People with special needs are often afraid and fearful of turning to medical professionals or going to various procedures also gaining their trust takes time and sometimes quite a lot! Unfortunately, many medical professionals are short on time or do not have the willingness to deal with sensitive and time-consuming patients/clients. But even such clients want to be beautiful, look their best and be confident, despite their fears.",
      "It is my little dream to create a space/salon where my client can feel special, comfortable, respected while receiving professional advise and treatment, considering the specifics of my client",
      "To make my dream come true, I would definitely need your support the most:",

      "To begin with, I need to rent a room where to start creating my little cozy dream salon (at the beginning I'll probably look for a room where most of the furnishings are already there).",
      "- Some medical equipment and devices to get started, especially a IPL laser to treat rashes, surgical and acne scarring, acne itself (not active and inflammatory), uneven skin tone and structure, pigmentation, also stretch-marks, which many overweight clients usually have, especially autistic people. Offer my clients regular skin inspections, assist them with hygiene tips, routine-based skin care and what products to use daily, taking into account their wishes and specific needs such as sensitivity to smells and allergies.",
      "- Also would like to have electrostimulation machine for clients who need for rehabilitation, to stimulate muscles and nerves and relieve pain, especially for clients with limited mobility to prevent muscle atrophy. For clients with chronic/acute pain or recovering from surgery. Reduce swelling and also for some clients for urinary incontinence treatment.",
      "*Comfortable bed for procedures requiring a lying position and comfortable chair for procedures requiring a sitting position are hopefully included in room already, if not then I hope to reach a goal as much to involve those too.",
      "That would be all I would need to start with. Sure I'm dreaming of a few more items, especially devices, but I hope I'll be lucky enough to be able to buy some myself.",
      "If I won't reach the entire goal I am dreaming here, I will use the money to save up for the laser. It is my dream!",
      "I believe and truly hope in my heart that my initiative will encourage medical professionals and cosmetologists to work more with people with special needs. They are often feared, thought to be unpredictable, aggressive, and difficult clients. I want to prove that they are also just people who want care, help, advice, be confident and to look good as we all want - both, men and women!.",
      "And of course you can feel in your heart that you have done a good deed for those weaker than you!",
      "The risk is definitely that I won't get enough clients, I have some patients from the hospital and clinic who trust me and are used to me, but it usually takes time to gain the trust of people with special needs. Hopefully I'll get enough advertising from existing patients and their loved ones. Also need to let my colleagues to advertise myself in hospital to reach to more clients.\nI've also thought about the fact that in the beginning I'll probably have to serve regular clients too, to get enough income and not fail.",
      "You can always share my idea with your friends, maybe they think it is awesome and want to help me a bit.

      "If too much modern tech is messing with your mind and bothering your balance, we developed DayDisc for you.",
      "We have ventured into forgotten realms of the past on an archaeological and philosophical journey. We wanted to rediscover how our ancestors were so capable before screens, wifi, and AI.",
      "And we've brought something useful back to the future:",
      "DayDisc is the fruit of our labour - a necklace that\u2019s also a new kind of activity tracker.",
      "It\u2019s radically simple, and amazingly effective. It tracks only what really matters to you, using simple and timeless analogue technology.",
      "Hidden magnets firmly hold the tracking orbs which you manually move around the disc to keep track of your completed activities.",
      "The DayDisc Challenge is simple, achievable and rewarding: just take 12 opportunities to work toward your goals, every day.",
      "By counting only what truly counts, it keeps you focused and clearly shows your investment in yourself, rapidly helping you form the habits that boost your wellbeing.",
      "Don\u2019t take our word for it. We\u2019ve shared DayDiscs with a small group of trailblazers, scattered around the planet, and they've shared their experiences:",
      "It's time for the analogue tech revival! DayDisc is already changing lives, and it changed ours, and we're pretty sure it can change yours too.",
      "So, if being an early-adopter in a grassroots global eco-wellness movement sounds exciting, please consider making a pledge to our campaign now.",
      "What makes personal development so challenging?",
      "The concept of self improvement is pretty straightforward. You already know the key steps to  successful change. Intent. Focus. Consistency. All that jazz.",
      "And in recent years, technology companies have developed all kinds of complicated gadgets - the 'Wearables', that were supposed to make it all easier.",
      "Only, they don\u2019t. Why?",
      "The trouble is that, far from aiding focus, these devices are specifically designed to distract. By manipulating the reward centres of our brain, they develop a stranglehold on your attention span. This creates a vicious cycle that makes it harder than ever to reach your goals.",
      "And by forcing us to adapt to how they work, they erode our autonomy and ingenuity.",
      "Besides, giving a third party access to your most personal information in this way is a pretty big deal. Can you trust its accuracy? And can you trust the company not to sell it, or get hacked?",
      "Smart devices don\u2019t last that long either. They\u2019re part of a cycle of planned obsolescence, designed to be made redundant by a slicker, \u2018smarter\u2019 version after a year or two.",
      "After immersing ourselves in online reviews, it became clear that many users of digital activity trackers or \u2018wearables\u2019 have unsatisfying experiences with them.",
      "Surely there\u2019s got to be a better way?",
      "Of course there is! That\u2019s why we\u2019ve developed DayDisc.",
      "A special kind of tracker that focuses on what attracts you, not what distracts you.",
      "Using just the fundamental forces of magnetism and willpower, DayDisc converts your best intentions into impressive outcomes. Engage in a personal daily ritual with your DayDisc, and you\u2019ll quickly develop the productive habits that you set your mind to. Designate specific, significant activities that will upgrade your lifestyle, as you might with a coach, and use your DayDisc to count and track them.",
      "No software - you are the operating system. No battery - you are the power source.",
      "DayDisc is a striking, gender-fluid talisman specially engineered for self-development. Intuitive and reliable, it uses principles of design and of psychology to build up the positive feedback loops that lead to lasting change. By making it easy to begin and sustain new and improved patterns of behaviour, DayDisc ensures you invest time in yourself.",
      "Daydisc is grounded and ergonomic, positive not pushy. It motivates you to achieve your own personal daily revolution, with the action of moving the tracking orb around the dial with a magnetic 'click' giving you discreet multi-sensorial feedback on your progress.",
      "Every morning, set your intention to complete 12 repetitions of an action in one day. And DayDisc will keep you on track.",
      "*there are no prescribed uses of DayDisc. The list of possible uses is only limited by the imagination. We look forward to hearing about the way people will use theirs.",
      "How you use your time determines almost everything about you: your personality, the state of your health, your beliefs and opinions, skills and talents \u2013 you name it.",
      "We are always becoming what we can be. This means change is inevitable, let's make it for the better...",
      "So get started with DayDisc, and take charge of your change today.",
      "Studies have shown that approximately 80% of New Year\u2019s resolutions fail! So clearly, we need better ways to stay motivated - new approaches are needed for your journey towards achieving long-term goals and resolutions.",
      "First, it\u2019s important to think a bit more carefully about your goal. To give yourself the best chance of success, goals should be:",
      "Simple but significant\nTrackable so you can monitor your progress\nRealistic and relevant\nTimebound so you can get regular",
      "But getting feedback on your performance and progress is important too, as part of breaking your goals down into achievable chunks. There are loads of great books available on habit formation, but it always boils down to the habit loop:",
      "DayDisc is designed to help you close the loop and thrive.",
      "There are loads of different ways you can use the magnetic tracking orbs that come with each DayDisc, but these three patterns have worked particularly well for us and our founding community of users:",
      "The Focus Orb:",
      "Use your favourite colour Orb to track the transformation of a single intention into a single habit. Pick one thing you want to do more often. Aim to complete 12 repetitions of that particular activity each day. Each time you manage it, move your orb to the next slot on your DayDisc.",
      "Congratulations! That\u2019s one orbit. A simple, clear, effective way to begin and sustain positive change.",
      "Mind, Body, and Spirit Orbs:",
      "Choose three Orbs and assign them to different types of activities. For example, you could use one for something Mind related, one that\u2019s Body focused, and another that\u2019s Spirit centric. Use the orbs to track your activities in all three domains simultaneously.",
      "This pattern is quite a challenge, but very rewarding. DayDisc\u2019s orbs can stack in the same slot, so don\u2019t worry if your goals overlap \u2013 this can create some pretty cool shapes and dynamics!",
      "Reminder Orb:",
      "Pick an Orb to live on your fridge, or desk lamp, or somewhere handy and visible. It will remind you of your daily goal whenever you see it.",
      "Bonus: you can also use it to remind yourself of meetings, appointments, or deadlines, by pre-positioning in the appropriate groove, eg. 4pm = groove 4. (Use this in conjunction with another pattern)",
      "We\u2019re also looking forward to hearing about patterns we haven\u2019t discovered yet, so please experiment, have fun and let us know what you come up with in the comments!",
      "Timeless construction. Timely functionality.",
      "We designed DayDisc to pay homage to the eternal values of beauty and usefulness. It represents the Sun, and abides by principles of Sacred Geometry. DayDisc\u2019s proportions are determined by the Golden Ratio.",
      "The radial design is due to DayDisc\u2019s original archetype as a watchmaker\u2019s tool. But rather than making clocks, this is a tool that creates time.",
      "The partitioning of the circle into twelve is an ancient method of segmenting time. Look at the Zodiac for example. Babylonian philosopher-priests used a base-12 counting system for a practical reason: it offers more whole fractions, making it easier to divide and subdivide.",
      "This means that, with DayDisc\u2019s twelve grooves, you can easily break down your progress throughout the day into sets and subsets. The circuit can be split into \u00bd, \u2153, \u00bc, \u2159, giving you an easy, versatile way to plan and track your activities.",
      "With DayDisc, your information isn\u2019t uploaded anywhere. It stays where it\u2019s needed most: with you. This makes it intrinsically stable, reliable, and sustainable. And with multiple orbs to play with, it\u2019s also pretty versatile.",
      "Each DayDisc comes with a commitment card.",
      "DayDisc is based on the polar opposite of planned obsolescence \u2013 something we like to call planned permanescence. Like the pyramids, or Stonehenge, or buried treasure. Planned permanescence makes for maximally sustainable objects.",
      "\u201cIt has to work forever.\u201d",
      "That was a key underlying principle in DayDisc\u2019s development. You pledge once for DayDisc, and it lasts forever, delivering a lifetime of value and more. It doesn\u2019t get much more sustainable than that.",
      "DayDiscs are guaranteed for the lifetime of your bloodline. Pretty much the only way to invalidate the warranty is to cast it into the fires of Mount Doom.",
      "We would be honoured if you took your DayDisc to your grave, or considered it an heirloom object to be kept in the family.",
      "Just a quick occasional polish will always restore its full shine.",
      "Wellness is huge now, and a growing market with lots of serious research in the field of behavioural studies and psychology to explain what makes us tick, and keeps us ticking healthily.",
      "We have gone deep into the literature during the design of DayDisc to make sure it follows proven psychological formats that will help you to improve your daily life and overall wellbeing.",
      "DayDisc\u2019s Western influences include the science of behaviour modification, Skinner operant conditioning, Cognitive Behavioural Theory, and many coaching schemes.",
      "But many of us in the West are missing out on the benefits of a holistic worldview that understands the universe and ourselves as manifestations of a single subtle energetic being.",
      "A lot of healing and harmony can be found in becoming sensitive to our true nature. And the technological obsession of western culture often distances us from the simplicity of this truth.",
      "DayDisc signifies a return to respect for the intrinsic properties of things. Circles are cyclic. Magnets are magnetic. Metals are strong. And we are active beings. These elements combine to create a vortex in the Aether which will empower your life.",

      "Magnets are considered safe by the US National Center of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), and magnetic therapy devices are actually in rising demand due to the impressive results and benefits users have obtained.",
      "Neodymium magnets like ours have been shown to increase microcirculation, and are increasingly being used to treat chronic pain syndrome, arthritis, wound healing, insomnia, headaches, and several other illnesses.",
      "The torus is the fundamental form of balanced energy flow. Energy passes through one vortex, along  the axis, out the other vortex, wraps back around and renews. It's the shape of some of nature\u2019s most powerful phenomena: tornados, whirlpools, black holes, and energy fields around planets and the sun. But it\u2019s also found around living organisms.",
      "This is what Shamanic Practices & Energy Medicine refer to as the Aura, Luminous Energy Field, \u201cLight Body,\u201d or Biofield in the scientific community. It radiates out in a toroidal shape, and through its interaction with the environment we can become depleted or recharged. We can be in flow or stuck, open or shutdown, healthy or sick.",
      "The basic idea of DayDisc is to promote energy flow, so it's fitting that it should have its own toroidal magnetic field.",

      "We consume somewhere between 500 billion to 1 trillion plastic bags per year, and it\u2019s totally unnecessary. Reusable bags are great for the environment, but most are bulky or poor quality. Nanobag 4.0 is a premium shopping bag so compact that you won\u2019t even know you\u2019re carrying it. The compact super-soft fabric easily folds into your pocket, and does away with impractical reusable shopping bags.",
      "If you want to make our project an even greater success, please share our campaign with your friends on Facebook. We will be eternally grateful!",
      "We're 100% committed to making a climate positive product. That means that we give more back to the planet than we take. We already consider our bags environmentally conscious, as they contain less materials than other bags in their category and offset single use plastic bags. In addition, for each bag sold we\u2019ll plant one mangrove tree with Eden Reforestation. Mangrove trees happen to be one of the most effective tools against climate change, and can store up to ten times more carbon than land based tree species. One single mangrove tree can store around 1750lbs (800kg) in its 40 year lifespan. As an added bonus they prevent soil erosion and help sustain coastal ecosystems.",
      "We're committed to creating high-quality products. The bags are made with premium custom made nylon polymer fabric and we've put in place a thorough quality-control and testing process to make sure you receive a great final product. We guarantee that your bags will be of excellent quality.",

      "In 2017, our first project, the Cubiio that started it all, was the most funded fabrication tool ever on Kickstarter. Now we\u2019re back with the 2nd generation - more powerful, much faster, yet still sporting a refined look with a compact footprint. At 2.5\" slim, with a diagonal of 25\" and a weight of 13 lbs, the Cubiio 2 features a workspace bigger than a standard Letter or A4 size paper, offering you plenty of room to flex your creative muscle.",
      "Thanks to the latest advances in semiconductor laser technology, our laser cartridge works on stainless steel directly, without pre-coating spray. Cubiio 2 can engrave on titanium, dark glass, shale, brick, concrete, most varieties of colored anodized aluminum, and other materials. It even works on curved surfaces, like wine bottles.",
      "Cubiio 2 can cut through paper, wood, leather, fabric, felt, cardboard, non-transparent acrylic, and many other materials. If the work material is too thick for a single pass to cut through, Cubiio 2 will continue to focus downward into the material for subsequent passes. The maximum cutting thickness is 5 mm.",
      "Cubiio 2 outputs at a resolution of 500 DPI or 0.05 mm. That\u2019s even thinner than your hair! In contrast to PWM control, our \u201crealtime analog control\u201d of laser power produces a wide range of gray tones. With Cubiio 2, your laser portrait is not only black and white.",
      "Put an object in the machine and take a top view picture with the Cubiio App. Don\u2019t worry about getting it perfect because the App will compensate for the angle deviation. Scale, rotate, position your art work, and go. What you see is what you get!",
      "Cubiio 2 is easy to use thanks to features like autofocus, preview, Wi-Fi remote control, OTA firmware update, cross-format compatibility, alignment-free optics, and embedded fume filter. Our App is user-friendly and intuitive. It is developed by programmers led by Mr. Michael Pan, an Apple Certified Trainer.",
      "Hundreds of amazing projects are ready to use in the cloud database (Cubiio Club). Browse, download one, and laser it immediately. Even a beginner can achieve amazing results. Cubiio Team has hired professional designers to enrich the database regularly. Users are also welcome to upload and share their projects with the community.",
      "Our Cubiio fanpage has over 23k followers. More than 5k Cubiio owners have joined the \u201cQuser group\u201d, where they share useful tips and thousands of beautiful pictures. If you have questions, seasoned enthusiasts from all over the world would love to help you. Just take a look at the amazing artwork they posted.",
      "Thanks to LiDAR, some high-end smartphones are now equipped with 3D cameras. LiDAR calculates distances by emitting infrared light to a target and measuring the time it takes for the reflection to bounce back. Cubiio 2 employs LiDAR technology to focus the laser beam on the target\u2019s surface automatically and precisely.",
      "Like every kind of light source, the laser has a limited lifetime and is a consumable product. Replacing the laser cartridge for Cubiio 2 is as simple as replacing the ink cartridge in a printer. We offer two types of laser cartridges, LC35 and LC50, with different wattages as shown below. Both types are interchangeable.",
      "Cubiio 2 is a Class 1 laser product - naked-eye safe under all conditions of normal use. The complete enclosure prevents the laser from leaking. Lifting the lid stops the laser immediately. Cubiio 2 is equipped with an attenuator, digital lock, thermometer, accelerometer, beeper, emission indicator, and emergency stop switch. Your safety is our top priority.",
      "Still here, still us, just 3 years older and with more experience. The Cubiio team closely cooperates with FPIC, a specialized company whose niche products are industrial laser cutters. These super machines can even cut sapphire. All Cubiio products are Made in Taiwan, where schools and businesses remain unaffected by COVID-19.",

Unlike other lights, AGILE provides a long runtime in it's most effective mode, not just in ECO mode!",

      "If 3D printing is such a disruptive technology that can bring impressive efficiency gains and localized micro-manufacturing capacity to anyone, then it shouldn\u2019t be as expensive and complicated as it normally is. That\u2019s why we decided to create Zoom Maker, the affordable and easy-to-use SLA 3D Printer that anyone can own and use.",
      "We believe in democratizing access to 3D printing technology. That\u2019s one of the foundations on which we developed Zoom Maker: it\u2019s designed to be affordable. However, what about the quality? Well, we don\u2019t believe in compromising the quality just to reduce the price. That\u2019s why you\u2019ll not only love Zoom Maker\u2019s price\u2014you\u2019ll actually fall in love with its superb quality.",
      "Zoom Maker does not only deliver a spectacular performance\u2014it\u2019s also very compact and extremely desktop-friendly. Measuring only 13.7 x 8.2 x 8.2 inches (35 x 21 x 21 cm) and weighing no more than 10 pounds (4.5Kg), Zoom Maker is the perfect 3D Printer for any small or large studio, office or workshop. Just place it on your desktop and see its magic happening!",
      "You already know that Zoom Maker is compact\u2026 but make no mistake: its reduced dimensions only make it more convenient to keep, carry, use and store but don\u2019t compromise its printing volume. In fact, Zoom Maker has a uniform maximum build area of 4.7 x 2.6 inches (120 x 68 mm) and a building height of 5.5 inches (140 mm). That means that while this is a small-sized 3D printer, it has the soul and capacity of a giant!",
      "As a 3D printing device, Zoom Maker is as easy to understand as it\u2019s easy to use. There are no complex requirements to operate it, so anyone can do it. Even better, Zoom Maker comes with easy-to-use software that supports a variety of desktop and cloud integrations, allowing you to seamlessly share and publish your creations. That\u2019s how we\u2019re making high-quality 3D printing more accessible than ever!",
      "HD 3D Printing isn\u2019t just a word we throw around. In the case of Zoom Maker, it\u2019s a key feature. Printing at 45 micrometres XY resolution and up to 10 micrometre Z layer thickness, Zoom Maker prints in higher resolution to give you an outstanding outcome in terms of having the details of your design finely reproduced when printed.",
      "That\u2019s the perfect sequence\u2014and you can engage in it with Zoom Maker. Equipped with a touch screen, you\u2019re only a few touches away from operating this 3D printer in a truly seamless way and having it created high-quality objects.",
      "Since it has an LCD display, Zoom Maker conveniently allows you to see the status of the 3D printing process at all times. It\u2019s a perfect window into your 3D printing world, letting you know in detail how long each printing process should take and what\u2019s the shape of the layer that the device is printing.",
      "Zoom Maker has a USB port that allows you to insert a USB flash drive with your project, touch the screen to choose which project in the USB drive you want to print and get it going. So, if an internet connection isn\u2019t available or if cloud-based drives aren\u2019t making your life easier, you don\u2019t need to worry about it. With Zoom Maker, all you need is a USB drive to start printing!",
      "FDM 3D printers are fast and cheap. That\u2019s true and it should be clearly stated. However, that\u2019s not enough because the quality it delivers isn\u2019t nearly as good as you\u2019d want it to be. And that\u2019s where an SLA 3D Printer such as Zoom Maker makes a difference: it\u2019s super-fast, it\u2019s super cheap, and it delivers extraordinary printing quality. That\u2019s why Zoom Maker is the 3D printer you need!",
      "We wanted to make 3D printing an easy-to-use technology, so that was one of our motivations to create Zoom Maker. However, we also wanted to create a 3D printer that offers more stability and reliability while requiring less intensive maintenance. Zoom Maker is a low-maintenance 3D printer that\u2019s built to work and print consistently and smoothly over time.",
      "Zoommaker has been producing high-quality 3D printers for years and has strong R&D capabilities. Now we enter the new stage of our product development, and we introduce the affordable 2K SLA 3D High-Performing Printer. We aim to create a 3D printer that is easy to use, affordable, and high quality. We believe 3D printers should be essentials for individuals and everybody can create the model as they like.",

      "Experience teeth cleaning like never before!",
      "The Bass Tooth Brushing (Scientific Vertical Brushing) is a method of brushing that effectively removes food debris and plaque from the gingival margins, gingival sulcus, and surface of the teeth, and is recommended by several national dental associations. By removing plaque and massaging the gums it helps to minimize disease-causing factors in the oral cavity, increase resistance to disease, prevent calculus, and prevent recession of the gums.",
      "Titanium is recognized as a non-toxic element in the world, and has become the \"King of Honorary Metals\" due to its resistance to high and low temperatures, strong acids and alkalis, high strength, and anti-bacterial and biophilic properties.\nTitanium itself does not emit harmful metal elements, so it is suitable for long-term use.",
      "Innovative L-shaped rotating vertical brush design: Unleash the potential of your daily oral hygiene routine with our Clean One 2.0 breakthrough.",
      "As we all know, horizontal brushing will grind the teeth into wedge-shaped defects, and it is not easy to remove the food debris in the crevices, which will easily cause chronic inflammation of the gums over time, resulting in bleeding and shrinkage of the gums, and even the pressure from the roots of the teeth will cause great damage to the gingival tissues.",
      "Say goodbye to the ordinary and embrace the extraordinary! With its revolutionary L-shaped design, Clean One 2.0 is not just a toothbrush, it's a game changer. The entire body is made of titanium, keeping it lightweight and resistant to surface flaking and oxidization. The new titanium material design is more eco-friendly and durable.",
      "Imagine: The Bass Tooth Brushing is a breeze with a toothbrush handle that rotates 180 degrees with ease. When you naturally master the scientifically proven vertical brushing technique, it cleans your gums and the inside of your teeth with ease, leaving you feeling energized. Get a cleaning experience unlike any other!",
      "The curves of the Clean One 2.0 handle have been carefully designed to be more ergonomic and fit the grip better for a more elegant grip and more comfortable brushing. When you start a new day, every comfortable experience may bring you a good mood for the day!",
      "Environmental protection and sustainability remain our mission. A toothbrush consisting of a titanium handle and recyclable brush head. Our goal is to reuse, reduce and recycle.",
      "The replaceable toothbrush head design can save you 95% of the plastic of your toothbrush every year. It is our duty to protect the green home of the earth. It's not just a slogan, it's an action. Join us. You'll get a state-of-the-art sustainable toothbrush that helps protect the planet! Clean your teeth, look great, and the Clean One 2.0 will come with a lifetime warranty.",
      "Toothbrushes are products we use every day and inevitably over 20 billion of them are thrown away every year! Most of them are made from cheap, disposable materials that have a short lifespan and are difficult to recycle! This is unacceptable.",
      "Clean One 2.0 comes with a replaceable brush head and ultra-soft 0.15mm food-grade silicone bristles, pampering your gums and dental health with the softest yet most effective bristles while being anti-bacterial. Use silicone toothbrush head gums do not bleed, because the silicone toothbrush fiber is thicker, instead of piercing into the flesh of the gums and teeth, which does not easily lead to capillary dilation, gum sensitivity bleeding. In addition the cleaning power is superb! This is because the silicone adsorption is very strong, like using chewing gum, to adsorb tooth stains.",
      "What does this mean for you? You can get a bright smile without creating plastic waste. Every brush helps create a cleaner environment.",
      "Removal: Remove the brush head by rotating the brush handle to the center and pulling the handle \u2461 out of the brush head \u2463.",
      "Installation: Insert the handle \u2462 diagonally into the brush head hole \u2460, then press the handle \u2463 into the brush head hole \u2461.",
      "Leaving your toothbrush lying around exposes it to all sorts of harmful bacteria, so we've also equipped it with a special toothbrush base that allows the Clean One 2.0 to stand securely without touching anything else, thus allowing the toothbrush to dry naturally. Together they protect your health.",
      "It's more than just a toothbrush, it's a transformative experience. Let Clean One 2.0 be part of the oral hygiene revolution on Indiegogo! Your support is more than just a better smile; it's a commitment to a greener, healthier future. It's time to embrace a new era of innovation, sustainability and oral hygiene!",

      "The most leading AI translation earbuds with smart noise reduction and bi-directional recognition",
      "Finally, natural real-time translations in 40 languages, in an earbud. Welcome to 2021.",
      "Zoom calls. Global suppliers. We live in the era of fast and easy communication. And yet when it comes to translation, most of us are lagging well behind the times. We\u2019re still fumbling with outdated phone apps and overpriced interpreters that leave you wondering, is this really 2021?",
      "Introducing the WT2 Edge \u2014 the world\u2019s first truly bi-directional simultaneous translation earbuds, translating in real-time as you speak and delivering it to your listener\u2019s ear in as little as 0.5 seconds. With up to 95% accuracy in 40 languages and 93 accents, they\u2019re the ultimate tool for breaking the language barrier \u2014 whether you\u2019re closing deals on a video call or sparking a friendship at the hotel bar. No more awkward pauses or interpreters, just fast and accurate translations, so you can immerse yourself in the art of conversation. From pillow talk to boardroom banter. Welcome to 2021.",
      "Until now, translating earbuds were a lot like old walkie-talkies. Only one person could speak at a time, while everyone else waited their turn to chime in. The translations worked. But the conversation was anything but natural.",
      "Those days are over.",
      "With the WT2 Edge, it\u2019s always your turn to speak. The Edge are the first earbuds to offer true bi-directional simultaneous translation, meaning you can speak and hear other people\u2019s translations at the same time \u2013 the way conversations were meant to be. No more awkward pauses to wait for your long-winded partner to finish. So your conversations flow naturally, from pillow-talk to boardroom banter.",
      "The WT2 Edge earbuds know your voice is unique. That\u2019s why it uses dual beamforming microphones and directional voice recognition to focus on the sound of your voice, separating it from other voices nearby.  So you\u2019ll never mince words with whoever\u2019s sitting next to you.",
      "And to make translations even more accurate, the Edge earbuds use smart noise-reduction to filter out distracting background noises. Making sure your message isn\u2019t muddied by motorcycle traffic and tapping pens. So when you do take the floor to speak your mind, your message comes across loud and clear.",
      "Every top translation engine has its perks. That\u2019s why we used... all of them. Powered by the world\u2019s 6 leading translation engines (DeepL, Google, Microsoft, iFlytek, AmiVoive, Hoya) and Timekettle its own, the Edge earbuds deliver faster and more accurate translations to your meetings and conversations. They take the advantage of all 6 engines and combines them to deliver a well-rounded translation experience that\u2019s truly world-class. Delivering up to 95 percent accuracy in some languages. So when you\u2019re plugging in at your next industry conference or talking sports with the limo driver, you\u2019ll know your words are getting a world-class treatment.",
      "Opportunity rarely knocks twice. That\u2019s why the WT2 Edge uses 15 servers worldwide to deliver you the fastest translations possible, no matter where you are. How fast, you ask? The Edge can deliver simultaneous, bi-directional translations in as little as 0.5 to 3 seconds. Bringing you professional-level translations to help your board meetings and client sit-downs go smoothly.",
      "Making connections just got a whole lot easier. Simul Mode helps you connect one on one for effortless face-to-face communication. Just share one of your WT2 Edge earbuds with your partner, and both of your words will be translated in real-time for natural, bi-directional communication without an interpreter. The way conversations were meant to be.",
      "The mic is always yours. With Touch Mode, you don\u2019t need to talk over each other in a multi-person meeting. Simply tap your earbud when you have something to say and you\u2019re in control of the conversation. Other mics are muted when it\u2019s your turn to speak, and your message will be translated and delivered to everyone listening. When you\u2019re finished speaking and ready to listen, just tap the earbud again to let someone else have their say. It\u2019s the perfect moderator to your cross-cultural conferences.",
      "We know you can\u2019t always ask strangers to put an Edge earbud in while you talk to them \u2013 like that taxi driver or bartender who speaks zero English. That\u2019s why we made Speaker Mode. While you\u2019re wearing an earbud, simply say what you need to say. The Edge will then translate and deliver your message through your phone\u2019s speaker, so anyone in earshot can hear it.",
      "Or if you prefer to keep the volume down, the Edge app also displays your translation in both languages on the phone screen. It even powers Text-to-Speech to read your typed messages out loud. Now you can go about your day without getting lost in translation.",
      "Just because you didn\u2019t study Mandarin in high school doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t handle the next business trip to Beijing. The WT2 Edge earbuds support 40 languages and 93 dialects. So no matter where you go, you can put your best foot forward knowing there\u2019s no situation or conversation you can\u2019t handle. From the moment you step off the plane, to the moment you stride into your dinner reservation.",
      "The best adventures often happen off the beaten path. That can also mean far from a good internet connection. That\u2019s why we equipped the Edge with seven languages and counting available for offline access. So whether you\u2019re sipping tea with your suppliers in South China or exploring a winery with your partners in Tuscany, the WT2 Edge is there to help get your order right.",
      "Travel bans. Quarantines. 2020 brought plenty of unexpected barriers to business. But language doesn\u2019t have to be one of them. The Edge\u2019s Group Chat supports up to thirty people speaking thirty different languages at once, making it ideal for Zoom calls and remote meetings, even when your business spans the globe.",
      "Group Chat even supports both voice-to-text and text-to-text recording through Edge\u2019s app. So you can leave the meeting minutes to us. They\u2019ll be automatically saved to the cloud in your desired language, ready for you to download, copy, and share to your heart\u2019s content.",
      "You\u2019ll be the talk of the town with the WT2 Edge\u2019s sleek design. And whether that town is Taiwan or Timbuktu, you\u2019ll understand every word they say in real-time. The Edge earbuds are 46% lighter than our last-gen translating earbuds and 33% smaller. Plus they weigh in at a sleek 5.4 grams each, so you won\u2019t even notice them in your ear while you\u2019re in and out of meetings all day or out exploring the city.",
      "We\u2019ve tailored the Edge earbuds to fit your ear comfortably while sealing in audio for superior noise reduction. The WT2 Edge is designed to sit snug in your ears for hours on end. So jump on that moped and enjoy the ride knowing your earbuds will stay right where they belong.",
      "Whether you\u2019re closing a business deal or ending a dinner date, the last thing you want to hear is a low battery warning. That\u2019s why the WT2 Edge gives you three hours of nonstop translating time on a single charge. And a full 12 hours with the portable charging case. Meaning you\u2019ll often have enough battery to power a full week of work or a short trip abroad on a single charge. So whether you\u2019re closing a deal in Calcutta or making friends in Frankfurt, you\u2019ll never be cut off mid-sentence.",
      "Three years ago, we brought you the first generation of translating earbuds \u2014 the WT2. For the first time in history, you could skip the interpreter and have a face-to-face conversation with someone in a completely different language, all with just a simple pair of earbuds.",
      "Then came the WT2 Plus \u2014 the best-selling translation earbuds on Amazon.com to this day with over 300,000 happy customers.",
      "But much like the business world, we never stop looking forward.

We\u2019re in the business of breaking down language barriers. We hope you are, too.",
      "Finally, a translation tool that can keep up with the pace of business. It\u2019s 2021 \u2014 time to demand more from your translations. No more pens to hold, no more awkward typing on your phone. Just a hands-free experience that delivers real-time natural translations within seconds.",

      "The most sharp and durable Damascus knife series we have ever made.",
      "... our most sharp and durable Damascus knife series we have ever made.",
      "Germanicum Arminius is the result of hundreds of hours in refinement of Damascus forging techniques, refinement of production technologies and design improvements on every level.",
      "Our team of dedicated engineers, black smiths and designers put all their passion into this new series of Damascus knives and today we are proud to share these beautiful new knives with you.",
      "Sternsteiger started its own production of Damascus knives back in 2015 and the companies passion for tradition and technology since then has driven the company to new innovations.",
      "Our engineers did not limit themselves to Damascus knives and brought beautiful knives like the popular Sternsteiger Titanium and Achilles Series to market. These endeavors not only helped us to understand the needs of our customers, but also provided us with the experience to improve on our original classic Damascus knife design.",
      "In case you are interested to learn more about the development process of Germanicum Arminius scroll down to the development section, but let us focus for now on what we have improved based upon our original VG10 series below.",
      "We completely re-engineered the finger-guard and bolster tip section of the knife in order to shorten the distance between handle and blade. This much more compact design results into a higher degree of control over the blade.",
      "For more pressure point and grip, a new added Bolster has been added below.",
      "The new bolster is made of the same Damascus steel and is held in place with two brass pins that are polished in a way that they optically merge with the steel.",
      "The new blade is overall more straight than the old design. On the picture below you can see how the old blade falls off towards the edge, while our new blade offers an almost straight surface.",
      "The tapered shape of the old blade makes the knife very stable, but also inflexible. The new flatter shape gives the blade more flexibility and thanks to the new steel we don't lose anything in terms of durability.",
      "In addition the new blade has been straightened with a slightly more curved belly while adding some width in the middle of the blade, providing a greater surface area for improved cuts.",
      "The biggest difference between the two series is the steel which now consists of 440 instead of 67 layers of steel. This increased amount of steel layers gives the blade much more rigidity and therefore increases the durability and lifetime of the blade.",
      "In addition the blade itself becomes a piece of art. Our black smiths have become very creative in regards to possible patterns that can be forged into the blade and therefore making each blade a unique master piece.",
      "The prominient but important feature is this handle, its made up of pure wallnut wood, as compared to our VG-10 series, which has an Micarta handle.",
      "The handle is finished by a pure Damascus cap which compared to the basic stainless steel cap from the VG-10 series gives these knives an even better look and durability.",
      "The old VG-10 series had an Oval shaped bigger Cap, where as the new Arminius series has an Egg shaped oval Damascus forged cap with a pin.",
      "The handle diameter has been trimmed making the Arminius handle thinner -tubular and easier to hold even for smaller hands.",
      "The same applies to the new handle cap as explained above.",
      "The Arminius series has different blade serrations for cutting bread.",
      "Even the Tip of the Arminius bread knife has been changed below ( continous form) below.",
      "The handle features the same updated characteristics like the brass pins and the red leather ring inlays with an added U sahped or V shaped forged Bolster below.",
      "The exciting striking feature of the new Arminius Series is its completely hand-made forging production as compared to the mechnical industrial production of our old VG-10 series.",
      "Since the carbon content is more in the Arminius series, its non stainless steel and have an increased tendency to oxidation process, which is a standard normal behaviour of all original historical hand forged damascus forge.",
      "Arminius Series is an inspired historical handmade forging process as compared to our old VG-10 series which is actually done via closed die forging or impression die forging. Our bladesmiths have used same old age forging methods to have this unique series for you.",
      "Damascus Steel & great warriors in history.",
      "It is been said that the great ancient warriors loved the damascus weaponary originated from the city of Damascus ( modern day Syria ). In those days, the damascus forgeing steel was forged with bringing the steel into a wootz form.",
      "Our team has been trying to forge a knife that has the unique combination of finest elements of steel & wood. For this reason, we included the 440 layers of damascus & the wallnut wooden handles for Arminius damascus Series.",
      "This unique damascus knife series will be presented in two damascus design patterns",
      "A- Raindrop damascus Pattern",
      "B - Twist damascus  Pattern",
      "Note:     ( patterns can slightly varry due to hand forge)",
      "We have deliverd successfully intime, to more than 4000 backers during our past amazing campaigns here in Kickstarter and  below are some of the Feedbacks for you to experiance, what they say about STERNSTEIGER products.",
      "The unique design inspired by the great fighter Arminius gives it an elegant look.",
      "Though Arminius Damascus Knife stands out of most Sternsteiger products, some special features of this masterpiece are as follows",
      "High-end Blade: The Damascus steel blade is certainly the best part about Arminius Damascus Knife. The unique design inspired by the great fighter Arminius gives it an elegant look. If you\u2019re concerned about quality, worry no more because it\u2019s going to cut through any to everything.",
      "Handle: The handle of Arminius Damascus Knife is made up of walnut wood and works for a lifetime. Yes, if you\u2019ll take good care of the blade, the handle isn\u2019t going to fade, broke, or lose its stylish look even after 10 years. In addition, it offers a firm grip to handle hard or raw vegatables.",
      "Handle Cap:",
      "The perfect harmony of joining the specially forged damascus cap adds up the stunning look to this amazing master piece series.The handle cap is made up of damascus steel which adds up an extra flare to this series.",
      "The forged Bolster:",
      "one of the added uniqueness to Arminius series, is its special forged blade bolster, which is a wedge shaped forged but gives the blade an added  ` U ` shaped support forge with colourfull red leather filled spacing to look after the joining effect to its amazing handle.This special forge bolster was developed for giving an additional cutting balance retention to this amazing knife series. ( see below the ` U `` shaped bolster with pins )",
      "So, now we see the hype behind popular Damascus steel knives. If we talk about this particular knife set, it is guaranteed to provide the best hunting or cooking experience ever.",
      "Arminius Damascus Knife is made with the highest quality of steels and a prolonged  manufacturing procedure of blacksmith.",
      "360 \u00b0 revolvation of Arminius Blade to show more details.  ( see above )",
      "The basic idea & design:",
      "Prototype Section: CAD Designs",
      "Combined with tradational classic design & focus onto better cuttings, our team tried to achieve a tool collection covering daily home use aswell the commercial use.",
      "Arminius bread knife has been inspired by the japanese saw inorder to break the tradational bread knife blade serations.",
      "The paring knife:",

      "Detailed Specification of our new Arminius Series:",
      "After each use, we highly recommend to immidiately wash up your knife with slightly warm water and apply a thin coating of cooking oil or olive oil. The oil keeps this amazing blade 's steel young and keeps away the building up of typical patina",

      "Brewer | Grinder | Scales | Kettle",
      "After a long day, all a coffee enthusiast wants is the perfect cup. But brewing an amazing cup of coffee doesn\u2019t always seem worth it: unpacking your pour-over setup, washing everything, carefully measuring and grinding, making a mess in the kitchen, and worst of all it still doesn\u2019t always come out the way you want it.",
      "But a wise barista makes use of all the tools available- introducing the Gevi 4-IN-1 SMART POUR-OVER COFFEE MACHINE, Brewer| Grinder | Scales | Kettle, each element held to the most exacting professional-grade standards.",
      "We\u2019ve sent the first batch of prototypes to some professional baristas. Stay tuned for more unboxing videos and special recipes!",
      "Coffee lovers know, grinding your coffee fresh for every cup provides the most flavor possible, and is a vitally important part of any kind of coffee process. Gevi begins with a commercial-grade burr grinding system featuring 60mm flat burrs, 51-step grind settings, and a built-in digital scale. It\u2019s designed to provide the optimum coffee grounds with close to zero retention. Simplify your coffee-making routine, save counter space, and start making gold-standard cups of coffee, today.",
      "When choosing a grinder, perhaps no virtue is as important as consistency- it helps you refine your technique and prevents distortion of your coffee\u2019s flavors. That\u2019s why, unlike traditional conical burr grinders, Gevi uses flat burrs to create more uniform micro-grounds and allow you to extract the maximum flavor, without heating up and distorting the flavor of your beans.",
      "And, our high torque motor turns slowly for cool, quiet operation, so you won\u2019t have to wake up the entire house to brew yourself a cup of coffee.",
      "Different brewing methods need different grounds. It\u2019s not enough to be consistent if you lack flexibility. That\u2019s why Gevi's rotatable dial allows for 51 distinct grind settings, and it can process a wider variety of coffee beans to produce many different extraction levels. This way, you have complete control over exactly how your grounds turn out, every time, for any drink you like.",
      "Additionally, the built-in scale provides automatic weight sensing and real-time display on the screen, for easy adjustment while experimenting or replicating your favorite recipe.",
      "Gevi allows users to customize the grind function to exactly match their needs. You can select the number of cups to be made, or the grind time, or the weight of beans. Still too complicated? The Free Mode is the most straightforward way to get coffee grounds from beans. Just pause or resume anytime you want, without having to fill in any information.",
      "Additionally, the flat burr grinders are removable for easy cleaning, and are rated to last for 529 lbs of coffee beans! We estimate replacements won\u2019t be needed for at least five years.",
      "The technique for perfect pour-over coffee is straightforward and fun, but it requires a long time to perfect, and every iteration takes time and focus. Gevi is here to help you easily, quickly, and reliably reach that level.",
      "The Gevi automatic mode is designed to ensure every cup achieves the Gold Cup Standard. Users only need to input 3 steps in Automatic Mode, so you won\u2019t have to worry about hand grinding your beans, blooming grounds manually, or carefully monitoring the temperature, angle, and speed of each pour- Gevi can take care of all that for you!",
      "Gevi\u2019s team of baristas have done the work to set up a variety of presets to simulate the manual pouring of an experienced barista - we call it Gevi-Standard Baristial Coffee. You can get the same world-class quality for less attention and no matter your experience level, with Gevi.  Besides, we are already in the application process of ECBC  (European Coffee Brewing Centre) Gold Cup Certification to advance its own Barista mode even further.",
      "Gevi uses three jet spouts that can rotate up to 360\u00b0 and pour from 3 inches up, mimicking the movements of an experienced barista to ensure all coffee grounds come into contact with the water, for maximum flavor extraction.",
      "Sometimes you don\u2019t want a standard recipe, instead, you need to just take things into your own hands. Gevi is a perfect backup, capable of exactly following your lead.",
      "In barista mode, every part of the grinding, heating, blooming, and brewing process can be sped up, slowed down, or even paused while you consider the next step in your masterwork. From the rotation speed and height of your pour to the temperature of the water, Gevi can help you experiment to find what best suits your taste.",
      "Instead of following a recipe, use the progress bars and digital graphs to customize the process by feel. Try new combinations of brew ratios, brew speeds, and bloom times, then save them for future use. Virtually every part of the coffee-making experience can be saved and perfectly replicated whenever you need it to deliver unmatched consistency every time.",
      "Found something that works for you? Give the recipe a name so you can call it up quickly, any time you like. Every time you feel like it, you can reproduce it perfectly, on-demand. Find something especially good? Share your unique recipe with a friend! Miss the cafe bonding experience? Gevi helps you share the exact same cup of copy, at the same time, with a loved one no matter where they are.",
      "Any high-performance machine needs occasional maintenance, and Gevi\u2019s descaling mode makes it easy and painless. Simply add a certain amount of the descaler into the water tank and start cleaning. You can also click \"second cycle\" to begin the next round.",
      "The Gevi comes with a cleaning brush and a coffee scoop neatly tucked away inside the hopper\u2019s lid, so you\u2019ll have everything you need to keep everything ship-shape.",
      "Not at your best before your morning coffee? Gevi\u2019s Beginner Mode displays instruction screens to guide you through the process. Experienced users can use Master Mode instead for a quicker experience, once they\u2019ve got the hang of things.",
      "There\u2019s nothing worse than an obnoxiously loud coffee grinder waking up the whole house early in the morning. Not only does Gevi offer premium grinding quality, but we also understand how important quiet grinders can be for those early mornings. The Gevi grinding process takes less than a minute, and best of all the noise level is kept under 70 dB the whole time.",
      "The constant temperature control system maintains water temperature at the desired brew temperature so you never risk scorching your coffee, and it warms up in under four minutes, saving you precious time in the mornings.",
      "You will have the option to choose the color or input voltage of the machine after you choose a specific perk on the right top of the page.

      "Connect Pro facilitates two-way full-speed USB 2.0 data transfer, clocking in at 480 Mbps, between any USB devices.",
      "Every cable includes a complimentary cord wrap, perfect for adjusting the cable's length or swiftly tidying it away for neat storage or transport. Say goodbye to messy and tangled cables for good.",
      "Our cables are built to last longer than ordinary ones, especially for iPhone users who often face durability issues.",
      "Crafted from high-quality materials like military-grade tangle-free nylon, they offer durability and reliability. Thicker cables handle higher currents for faster charging, reinforced with 4 x 3000D nylon braids for added strength.",
      "We've rigorously tested these cables with a bend test machine, subjecting them to over 15,000 bends at 180 degrees to ensure they withstand daily use. They also feature an anti-fray neck design to minimize fraying or snapping at common weak points, extending their lifespan.",
      "Magnetic cables also shield your phone port from dust and dirt. Leaving the tip in place reduces the wear and tear caused by daily insertions and removals, further preserving your phone port.",
      "Why our customers loved our Infinity cables!",
      "If you've bought our Infinity range before, we know you're wondering how and why this cable is different. Besides upgrading the tech, we've also improved its design based on the feedback we've gotten over the years, so it gives you an even better experience.",
      "Most phone manufacturers now offer their own \"fast charge technology\" with their latest devices. Check the table above to see if your device can use third-party cables for this technology. Devices with proprietary charging require their official cables for maximum speed. When using Connect Pro, the cable will still charge your device at the maximum speed possible without integrating proprietary charge technology.",
      "In order to achieve international certification for safe use, all cables are put through a number of rigorous industrial tests to ensure Connect Pro can withstand daily use.",
      "Having shipped over 300,000 orders, Chargeasap is a reputable and trusted brand in both crowdfunding and consumer electronics. All our cables come with a 15-year warranty, providing you with peace of mind for your early support.",
      "Connect Pro will be available in gunmetal and black. Each cable set includes a 1.2m (3.9ft) cable and tip of your choice (USB-C, Apple (Lightning) or Micro USB). Additional tips and cables can be purchased separately from the add-on section.",
      "If you'd like to  purchase any of the add-on items, you will be emailed a survey 14 days after the campaign finishes from BackerKit where you can:",
      "All rewards will be delivered via air freight directly from our distribution centre in Shenzhen, China. Backers are also expected to receive rewards between 4-21 days from shipping depending on the size of the delivery and your country (including USA). We've chosen this costlier method so no matter what country you're supporting from you don't have the long transportation times of sea freight.",
      "Chargeasap is a consumer electronics startup originating from Sydney with a global team who believe users should be the creators and innovators of products. We realize that your mobile phone is the one object you interact with every day more than any other object or person, so why not simplify this interaction?",
      "Our mission is to create highly innovative phone accessories that keep your devices fully charged at all times to truly keep up with your life on the go.",
      "Our team consists of serial entrepreneurs, creatives and engineers who've worked together since 2015 to overcome painstaking obstacles to bring to life the vision of each life-changing product.",
      "We're a startup that is backed only by ourselves. We have no external investors. Instead we launch products through the magic of crowdfunding. The funds raised here will not only go towards manufacturing, they will also help us to design future products.",
      "We've already had 11 previous successful campaigns, raising over $8 million and delivering to more than 130 countries.  Our previous campaigns have been featured in hundreds of major publications and online media worldwide.",
      "THANK YOU to our community of loyal backers for all your support in bringing our family start up Chargeasap to life and continuing to drive our innovation.",
      "We've already invested over $100,000 toward NRE (non-recurring engineering) costs to get the prototypes up and running and cover a big chunk of the initial mold fee. To get Connect Pro off the ground, we need the support of Kickstarter backers to help fund the materials for the first production run.",

      "Our top-quality matte powder-coat finishes launch in three colors to match your style. Each Chiller is available in Plum, Ocean or Sage. Choose your favorite color at Checkout when you purchase your Chiller.",
      "And it's more affordable! \nCeres Chill is more affordable than the current alternatives, especially considering the expense of coolers, ice packs, storage systems, and added plastic bags.",
      "Did my husband just steal my Ceres Chill for his tailgate?!  \nCeres Chill offers moms a beautiful alternative to coolers that they can proudly use for the rest of their lives. But that doesn't mean only moms will love it. With a 36 oz double-walled, stainless steel capacity or a 12 oz inner Milk Chamber for infusing water or chilling favorite beverages without dilution, you'll want to use this Chiller for sports drinks, coffee, tea, fruit-infused water, wine or beer for long after your breastfeeding days are behind you.",
      "And it converts to a baby bottle!\nCeres Chill is the best option for caregivers running out with the baby and bringing breastmilk along. Not only can you easily toss it in the diaper bag, you also have a bottle built right into the lid. Watch how...",
      "I've lived through the challenges of breastfeeding and spoken to hundreds of moms. The world needed an alternative to big ol' coolers and loads of plastic.",
      "I know firsthand that it is practically impossible to exclusively nurse a baby for a year: There's just no way to have your baby with you every moment, on every plane, in every boardroom,  or at your side on each battlefield (literally for our soldier moms and figuratively for the rest of us).",
      "To breastfeed up to this point, we've had no choice but to deal with what was available, no matter how clunky and difficult to use.",
      "Now we have a choice. We choose our babies, ourselves, and the environment.",
      "We want moms to have the very best designed Chiller made out of the very best, safest materials. We've already invested the money in design and stainless steel tooling so we're well on our way. Next up:",
      "Back us and one of the first Ceres Chill Breastmilk Chillers goes to you!",
      "Plus, Indiegogo makes it possible to donate a breastmilk Chiller. We chose Mom2Mom Global and Breastfeeding in Combat Boots, which support military families who face challenges breastfeeding all over the world. This is an exceptionally well-run joint non-profit worthy of generous support.",
      "This Chiller will change the world by helping moms and keeping huge amounts of plastic out of our landfills.",
      "We can\u2019t thank you enough for helping to make Ceres Chill a reality.",
      "We understand everyone isn't able to support us with a pledge. We're asking that you share what we're doing even if you can\u2019t give a dollar, purchase a Ceres Chill for yourself (who couldn't use 36 oz of state-of-the-art ice cold/hot storage?) or donate a Chiller to Mom2Mom Global. Help us spread the word on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, by emailing your friends a link to this campaign, or sharing it in all your great mama/playgroups and any other place you can think of!",
      "Shipping Times and Costs",
      "We're currently able to ship to the United States and Canada with discounted shipping at checkout.  3-6 business days is the expected speed.",
      "We are also now excited to announce we are shipping to the UK, Netherlands and Australia.  Shipping is discounted but still has to cross an ocean or two so it is $25 flat rate, even if you order more than one Chiller - so go crazy and make the most of the shipping cost!  Shipping will take 10-20 days estimated so those Chillers are predicted to arrive in October.",
      "We're working on worldwide shipping. Please email us with any specific questions about shipping and if you really need a Chiller to get to you in a specific country.",
      "Risks can always arise during a project like this. We've made sure we educated ourselves about the risks and found the right manufacturing partners to deliver the quality moms need and deserve.  We've assembled an amazing team to make sure we get these Chillers in your hands as soon as possible.",
      "Our top manufacturers are hard at work rolling these Chiller parts out, so THAT part of the risk is not a concern. The next thing is getting these Chillers assembled, packaged, out the door, and into your hands.",
      "We've kept the timeline as tight as possible because we know moms need these Chillers NOW.  Given recent trade and geopolitical issues, there is a risk of small delays that will be beyond our control, but we're taking every step available to get these Chillers here as soon as we can.  We're so close, but if anything comes up along the way, you\u2019ll be the first to know!",

      "A laser engraved aerospace aluminium ruler at a practical 30\u00b0 angle. For designers and for everyone.",
      "We are Orangered Life. We celebrate simplicity and smart design.  With four successful 30\u00b0 crowdfunding campaigns, 6,500 ecstatic backers, and 20,000+ delivered products, we\u2019re back and better with the 30\u00b0 Ruler 5.0!",
      "We believe life is best when simple things work...",
      "When we create our designs, we use various tools-some basic, some advanced. In the midst of design work on others, the humble ruler came to our attention and we began to look at one of our most used tools in a new light.",
      "Sometimes all it takes is one great idea to revolutionize a product. For the 30\u00b0 Ruler, it was a simple elevation. By lifting the slope on the ruler\u2019s face by 30\u00b0, we\u2019ve made it easier to use, and we\u2019ve expanded what you can use it for. It\u2019s simple but effective \u2013 that\u2019s what Orangered Life is all about.",
      "With a 30\u00b0 slope, you can read the measurements from a glance without having to lean over to use the device. So you switch from a tilted neck to a tilted ruler \u2013 keeping your back straight and your eyes on the target.",
      "The elevation also allows for easy grabbing, without having to drag it towards the edge of the table or dig your nails underneath it. Finally, the angled nature of the ruler makes it safe for cutting.",
      "Alongside simplicity, we believe clarity is key. The 30\u00b0 Ruler does away with teeny measurements, instead opting for large fonts and clear indications. This means you can read the measurements from a distance, and you'll always be sure to find your mark.",
      "Apart from its signature sloped design, the 30\u00b0 Ruler also has a couple of new features.",
      "This 2-in-1 ruler has millimetres and centimetres on one side, inches on the reverse. We've labelled them in the same direction allowing for easy conversions.",
      "The 30\u00b0 Ruler is designed to eliminate the confusion and strain of reading your typical ruler,  so every tick mark is labelled.",
      "The 30\u00b0 Ruler starts at zero. It is another simple design feature meaning you can start measuring from the very edge of the ruler instead of having to make adjustments for the useless blank space before the laser engraved measurements.",
      "The ruler itself is made from aerospace-grade aluminium while the measurements are laser targeted. In addition to making it more durable, the advanced materials make the 30\u00b0 Ruler more lightweight and scratch-resistant.",
      "The ruler also comes in four sizes of 15cm/6inch, 20cm/8inch, 30cm/12inch and 45cm/18inch; so you can choose the right sized ruler depending on what you\u2019re measuring.",
      "The new colour was one of the biggest asks we got from our previous backers. And we don't disappoint our backers! We exist because of you guys, so we're proud to offer the new colours and new sizes.  Not sure which you like? Don\u2019t worry about that yet! You will get to select your colour choice at the survey time.",
      "We love sharing our passion for this ruler.",
      "Through Indiegogo, we can cordially invite you on our journey and share with you the manufacturing process. We are passionate about what we do, and the opportunity to serve you and bring such a fantastic product to market has been an incredible adventure.",

We understand the pain of losing a camera not only for the device, but for the photos and memories that are lost with them. That's why our team created Mu Tag, as the easiest, smartest tracking device for anything.",
      "The whole purpose of Mu tag is to keep track of your things, and our software learning tech means that you no longer have to make that a conscious effort. Although users can manually set safe locations and notification distances for their Mu tags, the best part about the Mu tag is that you don't have to! With the use of AI, our app will learn what areas (home, office, etc.) are safe, and will avoid sending unnecessary notifications in these areas. Similarly, the app will use map data and other inputs to determine when users are in an area the requires immediate notifications. This means that you won't be bothered by an alert when leaving your laptop at home, but you will know the instant your wallet is left behind at a restaurant.",

      "Dr. Bob Baravarian is the inventor of ArchTek's patented arch support system and is a board-certified foot & ankle surgeon with more than 20 years\u2019 of patient care experience. After he experienced foot pain during his travels, Dr. Bob wondered if there was a better and more affordable solution than wearing special shoes or expensive custom insoles to prevent foot pain. He worked for more than 2 years to re-engineer every aspect of the classic sock to create a more modern sock that is better for the foot and leg. \u201cArchTek stands for innovation, and changing the status quo for affordable, every day, fashionable socks.\u201d",
      "Nearly 8 in 10 Americans have suffered from foot pain and are also likely to have pain in other parts of their body because of it, according to the American Podiatric Medical Association. However, many people don't realize a sock can do as much to support the foot as an insole or a shoe can.",
      "ArchTek\u00ae is more than just a sock. It is footwear featuring patented technology that is a complete overhaul of the traditional dress sock. The ArchTek\u00ae sock allows the wearer to wear their athletic or dress shoes of choice, without compromising style or support.",

      "Risks and challenges",
      "At ArchTek, we understand the importance of brand reputation, especially for new brands. We have spent over 2 years in preparation for this launch, which consists of design, product development, establishing logistics and shipping channels and executing pre-production runs to ensure a seamless and enjoyable experience to our backers. We will be working with trusted manufacturers, who supply many global brands. They work with some of the world\u2019s biggest brands and have the capability, scale and expertise to meet any demand. We have the utmost confidence in their ability to deliver. We also planned for production risks by producing approximately 1200 of each SKU, and could quickly manufacture more as needed. Regardless, there could be production delays as with any manufacturing. We will perform thorough checks of the finished pieces using industrial QC standards. With any high volume production run, the biggest inherent risk is timing. We\u2019ve consulted with numerous logistics experts and sample tested our manufacturer to ensure we can deliver an amazing product on time. We will be extremely transparent and open with regards to updates on the status of production and shipment. We will be working with a local fulfillment center in the US, hence custom charges may apply depending on where you're ordering from. Each parcel will have a tracking number so it can be tracked. Unfortunate events can sometimes happen, so in the event a parcel is lost during its delivery we will do everything we can to help track it down and if the error is with our team we will send you a new one. However, we are not responsible for packages delivered outside the expected time frame. We will be posting regular updates here.",
