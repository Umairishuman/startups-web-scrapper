There are so many advantages with the 18 inch wheel but just one option in wheel covers. Time to change that. Introducing Orbital wheel covers.",

      "We believe this is a new challenge for us and the simplest way that all people around the world can contribute to protecting the earth. We are prepared to ship to any country in need of the O2 BAND's value. We hope that Indiegogo backers can empower our journey.",
      "The main technology of O2 BAND PRO is to enhance the density of oxygen entering to engine.",
      "O2 BAND PRO is made up of a mixture of components that emit infrared radiation in response to the engine\u2019s thermal energy.",
      "The heat energy generated by the engine causes changes in the car. It reacts with O2 BAND and creates a infrared radiation The infrared radiation vibrates the oxygen's movements and increases the efficiency of the engine's energy levels.",
      "Oxygen with high density is used during the engine's explosion stroke. Helps to increase combustion efficiency, reduces harmful emissions such as CO2/CO/NOX and Creates eco-friendly effects. (increase fuel efficiency, reduce carbon dioxide, etc.).",
      "The high concentration of the air increases fuel efficiency and decreases the emission. This results in an improvement in cost per mile. Reduced oxygen particle force leads to diminished noise and vibrations, noticeable by drivers. Even with the same force on the accelerator, the ride becomes significantly smoother.",

      "In the journey of all Kickstarter projects, risks and challenges are inevitable and they are obstacles that must be overcome to realize your dream product. However, please believe in the strength and determination of our professional team, which will surely turn risks into opportunities. Currently, the product prototype is progressing well and the initial performance indicators have met expectations. From the precise fit of the cutter head to the stable output of the motor, it has been tested and optimized repeatedly. However, we are well aware that going from prototype to mass production is like going from a laboratory to a complex battlefield with many uncertainties. For example, the supply of raw materials may be interrupted due to market fluctuations, or the production process may have hidden problems during mass production. For this reason, we have established a comprehensive risk warning and response mechanism. On the one hand, we have established close cooperative relationships with a number of raw material suppliers to ensure stable supply. On the other hand, we have assigned technical experts to monitor the entire production process and formulated contingency plans in advance. In addition, we are committed to maintaining transparency. We will keep you informed of the progress of the project, problems and solutions encountered, and future plans through regular updates and exclusive information pushes.",

    "description": "The incredibly bright rubber block of light that attaches to anything and lights up everything.",
    "company_name": "Thomas Gostelow",
    "allParagraphs": [
      "The incredibly bright rubber block of light that attaches to anything and lights up everything.",
      "The Glowstone is a rubber flashlight that can be customised for almost anything, whether its for DIY, Photography, or even SCUBA diving.",
      "Housed in a strong silicone body, it is waterproof, dust-proof and gas-proof. With its stiff metal spine and composite construction, it's as tough as it is bright.",
      "There are 2 options available, the 900 Lumen Flashlight, which has a runtime of 1.5 to 60 hours, or the 2000 Lumen Flare which can operate for between 4 to 320 hours between charges.",
      "Yes, a pocket-sized light that stays continuously lit for 2 weeks!",
      "The flashlight has 5 brightness modes, edge lighting and 4 flashing modes including SOS and strobe. It also has charge indication.",
      "The Glowstone Flare takes everything good about the Flashlight and added even more brightness, power and functionality.",
      "It is aimed at those with professional lighting needs, or those that take their recreation seriously. It's perfect for those week-long hikes, working on a construction site or as a photographers portable lighting tool.",
      "The 2000 Lumens Flare is roughly twice the width of the Glowstone Flashlight and twice the depth, but with more than 5 times the battery power.",
      "It has colour temperature adjustment, UV lighting, red/ green lighting modes and even an app for controlling your flare remotely.  It also acts a wireless power bank. Combine this with the attachments that allow you to customise it and It truly is the Swiss-army knife of lights.",
      "The Glowstone Flare has an incredibly powerful 10.5Ah (3.7V) lithium-ion built into it, which is why it's so bright for so long. It's a serious piece of kit.",
      "Both the Flare and the Flashlight are available in Arctic white or Graphite grey.",
      "The Glowstone is a completely sealed rubber pebble of light with a stiff metal spine. It's wireless recharge only, has no sockets and therefore no weak points on its body, making it inherently tough.",
      "It means you can put it in some pretty extreme conditions, like a boiling pan or a block of ice, and it keeps working. You can even throw it off a 4 story building and it still work. That's the benefit of having an IP69K waterproofed and ATEX rated product.",
      "The patented design of the Glowstone makes it reliable and as it's flat and lightweight, its ideal for almost any job.",
      "Emergency services such as mountain rescue and the RNLI (lifeboat rescue) are looking at using the Glowstone as part of their standard issue gear.",
      "They like that it's fully waterproof, wearable, small and lightweight, has a long battery life and floods the area with a clean bright light.",
      "When people's lives are at stake, it's important to have your hands free and to clearly see what you are doing.",
      "But underneath that tough exterior, is a high quality, photography standard light.",
      "The light output is clean and even, making it great for selfies, zoom calls or for applying make-up with. Its also a very comfortable light to work under.",
      "Just look at the clean blanket of light the Flashlight emits compared to a traditional flashlight.",
      "As well as being a convenient everyday carry Flashlight, it's a great light for photography and filming, because of:-",
      "1) High CRI. With a colour rendition of 95+, the Glowstone shows the natural colours of the subject accurately.",
      "2) Natural Colour Temperature. The Flashlight emits a 5600K white light, equivalent to daylight at noontime. The Flare allows colour adjustment from between 2600K to 7000K.",
      "3) LED panel. The Glowstone is a rubberised, miniature version of the LED panels seen on movie sets.",
      "The Flashlight has 30 LEDs, whilst the Flare has 44 LEDs, all of which are individually controlled.",
      "As we use an LED array, the light from the LEDs merge to create a constant and clean blanket of white light.",
      "There are no lenses over the LEDs either, as these create halos and hotspots to the light output.",
      "Another benefit of the LED panel over normal flashlights is that the heat isn't concentrated in one spot. As the light is spread over many LEDS, the heat is spread over a larger area, so less heatsinking is required, making the Glowstone both smaller and lighter.",
      "We were lucky enough to have the Flashlight reviewed on a BBC TV program where members of the public review products.",

      "The Glowstone Flashlight being used for SCUBA diving.",

      "Whether you want to be look good on your next Vlog, look stunning on your next Instagram post or have a convenient light that you fit into those small gaps to light those scenes better on a film set, this pack will provide you with the accessories needed.",

      "This is the real Swiss army knife pack. As well as a huge range of quality accessories, you get a beautiful carry case to keep it all tidily in one place.",
      "We've patented the design and construction of the Glowstone. But how can it be innovative in a market where thousands of flashlights already exist?",
      "1) Seal everything in Silicone.",
      "Silicone is a wonderful material. It's soft and lightweight but tough. It's resistant to saltwater and environmental degradation and it's fire-resistant, with a melting point of 1410 degrees Celsius.",
      "Silicone's made from sand rather than oil, so it's manufacture is more environmentally friendly than plastic.",
      "By covering everything in silicone, both inside and out, we create a solid rubber pebble of light, with no weak points.",
      "Combine that with its metal spine and the Glowstone just bounces it's way to safety.",
      "Even when you put it in the most uncomfortable of situations, like freeze it in ice, THEN throw it off a building. Have a look at this video!",
      "Covering everything in silicone makes the Glowstone inherently robust and waterproof, but it also acts as an oxygen barrier. When things are isolated from oxygen, they can be preserved for a very long time, just like DNA in a mosquito trapped in amber.",
      "Silicone is used in heat pastes to remove heat from electronics. As the components are potted in silicone, the Glowstone is very affective at removing the excess heat.",
      "Our patented construction means the Glowstone passes the highest standards for waterproofing (IP69K - completely dustproof and can withstand washdown at pressures of 80 to 100 bar/1,160 to 1,450 PSI, in phases of 14 to 16 l/min, and at temperatures up to 176\u00b0F/80\u00b0C.)",
      "Its designed to meet the highest standards for use in hazardous areas. The electronics are potted in silicone,  the silicone will isolates any sparks from the electronics, which prevents an explosion. As the inside is filled in, there is no internal gas that could quickly expand and cause an explosion. This is how we meet the highest ATEX rating (Zone 0), without any extra features such as gas vents which would have increased the size and cost.",
      "Atex rated: safe for use in Zone 0 (where Ignitable concentrations of flammable gases or vapours are present for long periods of time)",
      "ATEX flashlights typically cost many hundreds of dollars, but through good design, we've provided the highest standards for safety and functionality at a consumer price.",
      "On top of all that, silicone makes the Glowstone so satisfying to hold and squeeze.",
      "2) Make it wireless recharge only.",
      "Nearly every electronic device I've owned have failed because of the power socket. My last phone died because water got inside, through the power port. The phone before became unusable because I couldn't get the power cable to connect. Even my laptop's power port was recently repaired too. All that expensive equipment made redundant by the failure of one simple component.",
      "The socket is also a weakpoint in the body of electrical devices. If I was to drop my device, it would tend to break around the power port.",
      "Not only that, but the socket itself takes up a lot of space on a device. It's time to say goodbye to the power port and replace it with a very thin, lightweight wireless power coil.",
      "This means that the Glowstones are surprisingly small and thin. The Flashlight is just over 1/2\" thick (Dims: 68x51x14mm) , whereas the Flare is 1.2\" thick (86 x 69 x 30mm).",
      "The wireless coil can also transmit power as well as receive it. So the Flare can be used as a wireless power bank, should you need it.",
      "3) Change the shape",
      "Making it flat and rectangular makes it convenient to carry. It doesn't roll away when you place it somewhere and Its rubber exterior grips well when perched on surfaces.",
      "Its flat back meant that we could use cool new things like nano-suction pads to stick it to flat surfaces.",
      "It shape also made it easy to customise, which brings us to the final point.",
      "4) Make it modular",
      "We have hand lamps, head torches, bed-lamps, inspection lanterns etc, all for specific lighting needs. What happens? Because they are single-use, they are seldom used. So you end up with a drawer full of lights that when you try and use them, the batteries are dead, or worse, leaking.",
      "Why can't your head torch be a hand lamp, a bike light or even an desk lamp?",
      "One of the most exciting things about the Glowstone is that it can be adapted to almost any scenario. Whether it's stuck to the side of a sewing machine to help an elderly lady with failing eyesight continue her hobby or a disabled user that simply couldn't find a light to fit their wheelchair, the Glowstone unlocks many new applications and, in some cases, can improve someone's quality of life as a result.",
      "Work began on the Glowstone back in early 2016. We purchased a bunch of SMD LEDs, soldered resistors to them and some standard batteries and, after a week of assembly (mainly with tape, solder and sealant) were dazzled by the prototype. Have a look yourself.",
      "We then spent 2 years trying to squeeze that assembly you see in the video into something smaller than a credit card.",
      "There was nothing else like it in the world so we excitedly launched the Glowstone on Indiegogo in late 2018.",
      "The original concept was to mould the body around the electronics and batteries. For 2 years we worked on moulding the Flashlight. Sadly though, the moulding process was too hot for the batteries, even if we froze them beforehand. These 2 years of manufacturing development cost many thousands of pounds and nearly killed the product and our company.",
      "So we went back to the drawing board and changed the design. Instead of moulding around the components, we moulded just the outside and filled the inside with a silicone. This was a much more reliable process and less damaging to the batteries. At last we had a process that we could produce the Flashlight with.",
      "Finally, we could fulfil our Indiegogo project and send our backers a better product than we had promised them during the campaign. They appreciated our tenacity and we appreciated their kindness and patience.",
      "The journey to create the Glowstone has been long and challenging but rewarding for all involved.",
      "We return to Indiegogo 5 years later with the perfected Glowstone Flashlight. We are so proud of it - it is truly a product that wouldn't exist without crowdfunding.",
      "For this campaign, we have created 2 major additions to the accessories that make the Glowstone the multi-tool light we dreamed it would be. The belt clip was upgraded into the Magnetic MOLLE stand and a light diffuser was created.",
      "This campaign is in part to create these new accessories, but it is mainly to give birth to the Glowstone flashlights bigger brother, the Glowstone Flare.",
      "The Flashlights are being built now and will be ready to ship as the campaign closes.",
      "The new accessories for the Flashlight and Flare will be made once the campaign closes. Flashlight packs that contain the new accessories will be shipped in February.",
      "The Flare requires more electronics and software development and will be shipped in April 2024.",
      "The Flare's manufacture is similar to the Flashlight, with the addition of a protective steel enclosure around the electronics and batteries. Which brings us nicely to our next section....",
      "The Flare has a very powerful battery (3.7V, 10500 mAh), is a little larger than an action camera and weighs around 11 Oz (275 grams).",
      "It also has:",
      "Stainless steel internal lining",
      "We've added even more strength to the Flare by encasing the electronics AND batteries in a 1mm thick stainless steel enclosure. This shell will be filled with and encased in silicone to give it even more strength. It may even make the Flare bomb-proof. We are looking forward to testing that out :)",
      "UV LEDS",
      "This enables you to a number of cool things like authenticate bank notes or spot scorpions when you are out in nature.",
      "Red and Green LEDs",
      "A lot of ramblers, early morning dog-walkers and military personal requested a red/ green light option as this light doesn't travel far. So we've added both colour options to the Flare.",
      "Temperature colour adjustment",
      "This is the photographers new best friend, so we needed to give it the ability to finetune to their needs. 22 of the LEDS are at 2600K and 22 of them are at 7000k and you can adjust between the two, either using the two buttons on the Flare, or via the app.",
      "App controlled",
      "Because of it's enormous battery life and its extra features, we are developing an app to better control your Flare. This will give you a few extra features as well allowing you to leave your Flare mounted in a wall for example but turn it on and off, check its battery level or change its colour temperature.",
      "And of course, because it has the same patented construction as the Flashlight, It is waterproofed to the highest standards (IP69K) and Intrinsically safe to use in hazardous areas (Atex rated - zone 0)",
      "Combine that with it's 6 times more battery life and you are left with THE ULTIMATE LIGHT.",
      "The Flashlight was designed to be the new age of personal lighting, the Flare has been made for your professional lighting needs - Where you need a really bright clean light all night and day.",
      "Thank you for reading this far, I hope you back this project and help bring the improved FLASHLIGHT and the brand new FLARE to life.",
      "We are the archetypal crowdfunding company. We rely heavily on the support of our wonderful backers and are very engaged with them, We use their feedback to improve the product. It's a very satisfying process for all involved.",

      "Measure:Metric, Imperial;Slide Rule,Caliper & Titanium MiniPen-All in One Compact Ruler.",
      "Everyday measurements often involve tedious unit conversions. Instead of buying multiple rulers or converting manually, why not have one ruler display both units? This idea inspired Mix 3.0.",
      "Have you ever needed a pen while measuring but couldn\u2019t find one? To fix this, we added a mini pen into the Mix 3.0, so you always have one nearby.",
      "After measuring, calculations are often needed. So, we added calculation functions directly into the ruler, allowing you to measure, convert, and calculate with one tool.",
      "This is how the Mix 3.0 was created\u2014making measurements simpler, smarter, and more efficient.",
      "It\u2019s the perfect addition to your toolbox, always ready to tackle any task you throw at it. Tailored for DIY enthusiasts, craftsmen, students, architects, engineers, and anyone who values accuracy and comfort.",
      "We've improved on Mix 2 by combining metric and imperial into one unit. This feature allows the user to obtain values in both units of measurement at the same time, eliminating the need for metric/imperial conversions and making it the perfect tool for professionals and hobbyists working in different environments. Whether you need metric precision or imperial convenience, the Mix 3.0 eliminates the hassle of juggling extra conversions.",
      "Metric And Imperial",
      "The Mix 3.0 features magnets installed beneath the scale, providing reliable stability whether it's in use or being carried outdoors. This magnetic design ensures the ruler stays securely closed, preventing accidental openings and maintaining stability at all times\u2014even when hanging it during work.",
      "By smoothly extending to the required length, the Mix 3.0 ensures accuracy and convenience for any task, whether it\u2019s for professional use, DIY projects, or fieldwork. This enables users to measure larger objects or distances without the need for additional tools.",
      "Extension measurement",
      "The Mix 3.0 features a concealed screw design that enhances its sleek and seamless appearance while ensuring robust functionality. By integrating the screws within the structure, the design eliminates protrusions, creating a smooth, streamlined aesthetic that\u2019s both practical and visually appealing. This innovative approach not only improves durability by protecting the screws from wear and tear but also contributes to the caliper\u2019s modern and minimalist design.",
      "Mix 3.0 goes beyond standard measuring tools with its ability to double as a caliper and stationery ruler. This multifunctional feature allows the caliper to seamlessly transition from precision measurements to serving as a reliable ruler for straight lines, drawings, or technical sketches. Whether you're working on design layouts, drafting, or simply need a sturdy, accurate for your measurement, the Mix 3.0 ruler's sleek titanium design ensures precision and durability in every use. With an overall length of 12cm, this tool has a retractable construction that makes it easy to carry around or slip into a stationery case.",
      "Succession of calipers",
      "Designed with ultimate convenience in mind, the Mix 3.0 Ruler is embedded with an excellent grip Hexagonal MiniPen inside the ruler. With this unique addition, you\u2019ll always have a pen at hand for jotting down measurements, sketching designs, or making notes in the field. The refill is a standard D1 Pen Refill, which can be purchased and replaced at any time. This thoughtful integration eliminates the need to carry extra writing tools, enhancing portability without sacrificing functionality.",
      "Also, crafted from durable titanium, the pen not only complements the caliper\u2019s sleek design but also ensures longevity and resistance to wear. For added versatility, the pen can be easily removed and used as a standalone accessory with a lanyard to transform into a stylish pendant, making it a both functional and fashion-forward tool.",
      "The magnetic pen cap design is ingenious, allowing you to easily attach it to your keychain at any time. Whether you're out on a job site, working on a project, or taking quick notes on the go, the embedded pens make sure that precision and convenience are always within reach.",
      "Take it to everywhere",
      "Crafted from high-quality steel, the cutter head can be seamlessly swapped with a standard pen head, transforming your writing instrument into a precision cutting tool. Ideal for designers, engineers, and DIY enthusiasts, this replaceable blade offers versatility for tasks like fine cutting, shaping, or crafting.",
      "The Mix 3.0 Ruler streamlines the complex structure on the back of its previous two generations, creating a larger space for creative use and adding a slide rule function. This clever addition allows for quick math operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division directly on the tool, making it easy to calculate dimensions, or conversions without needing extra devices. Whether you\u2019re working with complex measurements or corresponding calculations, the backside calculation feature is a practical solution for efficiency in the field.",

      "Its unique thickened design enhances the grip and gives you a more stable and efficient measurement experience.",
      "Designed with portability in mind, the Mix 3.0 Versatile Ruler is crafted to be a compact, pocket-sized tool that fits effortlessly into your everyday carry. Its sleek, lightweight titanium construction makes it both durable and easy to carry. Whether you\u2019re heading to the workshop, job site, or simply keeping it on hand for on-the-go precision, this pocket-friendly caliper ensures that professional-grade measurement and multifunctionality are always within reach, without adding bulk.",
      "The Titanium EDC Multi-Function Ruler is a stress-relieving fidget toy that combines precision and a soothing touch. Whether you're adjusting the calipers, flipping the edge of the scale, or using the built-in mini pen, the subtle mechanical clicks and smooth operation provide a relaxing experience that naturally grabs your attention and offers a quick stress reliever at work, in a meeting, or taking a break.",
      "The Titaner Mix 3.0 Titanium EDC Versatile Ruler is crafted with a combination of premium Gr5 titanium and a unique internal Phosphor bronze structure, making it a standout tool in both design and durability. The internal brass structure is used because it has a lubricating effect, allowing for a smoother adjustment. This construction not only ensures a strong, lightweight feel but also provides a distinct look that combines industrial aesthetics with refined functionality.",
      "The embedded tritium tube slots , with its compact size of 1.5\u00d76mm, not only gives the Ruler a unique appearance but also emits a soft, continuous glow, enhancing visibility in low-light conditions. It adds a touch of sophistication and practicality and gives the Mix3.0 a futuristic appeal.",
      "The Mix 3 features a cleverly integrated lanyard, ensuring full functionality of the Ruler even when attached to a cord. This thoughtful design enhances portability and storage convenience, making it an essential tool for professionals and enthusiasts who value precision and versatility.",
      "Engineered to the highest standards, the Mix 3.0 combines CNC precision processing with a laser-engraved scale for unparalleled accuracy and clarity. Its high-precision components deliver millimeter-perfect measurements, while silky-smooth adjustable slides provide effortless operation. The durable laser-engraved scale features sharp, easy-to-read markings that resist fading, guaranteeing precise results every time.",

      "We offer a truly unique and personalized DIY engraving option. You can customize it with your name as a keepsake, making it a meaningful gift or memento\u2014perfect for special occasions or expressing your personal style.",
      "Please note: When supporting Mix 3.0 on Indiegogo, you won't be billed for shipping immediately. Instead, shipping will be charged via a fulfillment survey after the campaign ends.",
      "Below you can see the estimated shipping costs based on the biggest regions. The situation of global shipping is constantly changing, so these prices may change a bit. The actual costs will be calculated once we are about to ship in MAR 2025.",

      "The transforming, magnetically-attached mobile gaming controller that actually fits in your pocket.",
      "With console-level precision and effortless portability, the MCON transforms your smartphone into a gaming powerhouse. Play Now.",
      "Hey, we\u2019re Ohsnap! We\u2019re a North Carolina-based mobile accessory brand driven to find better ways to use your phone. We\u2019re known for creating ultra-functional, ultra-thin phone grips with a focus on premium materials and usability.",
      "We already have 6 previous successful crowdfunding campaigns (3 on Kickstarter, 3 on Indiegogo), each of which has been fulfilled on schedule. With a focus on clear communication and quick resolution of any issues, we\u2019ve reached a total of over 80,000 backers on crowdfunding sites, and over 1M customers on our own store.",
      "3D-Printed prototype. Colors & finish not final.",
      "Stop using bulky controllers with finicky connections! MCON is the only controller that magnetically slaps to the back of your phone and fits in your pocket! It connects to your phone via bluetooth for easy connection and low-latency gaming.",
      "Launch spring will be hidden on production version",
      "Press down on both buttons at the same time to activate MCON\u2019s auto sliding mechanism that magically reveals the controller from behind your phone and simultaneously slides your screen into the optimal angled position for gaming.",
      "MCON has friction fold out style grips that lock into place for the best ergonomics and comfort for serious gameplay.",
      "Adapter will look more refined in final version.",
      "We designed the MCON to adapt seamlessly to the wide variety of phone shapes, sizes, and camera bump heights, all while keeping it as slim as possible. To achieve this, each MCON comes with two \u201cpucks\u201d, which are thin, 2.5mm discs with embedded MagSafe magnet arrays. Here\u2019s how it works:",
      "1. Adapting to Your Phone:\n\u2022 The pucks attach to the steel plate on the MCON, which is what your phone mounts to.\n\u2022 If your phone has a larger camera bump, like a caseless iPhone 16 (camera bump ~4.5mm), you\u2019ll stack two pucks to ensure proper clearance.\n\u2022 For phones with smaller camera bumps, like an iPhone 12 (~2mm), one puck is usually enough.\n\u2022 If you\u2019re using a case, the case itself often acts as a spacer, so you might only need one puck or none at all.",
      "2. For Phones & Cases Without MagSafe:\nWe\u2019ve included a MagSafe adapter in the box. This is a 2mm-thick disc with adhesive on one side. If your phone or case doesn\u2019t have MagSafe (e.g., most Android phones), simply stick the adapter onto your phone or case. The adapter enables your phone to work seamlessly with the MCON system. By stacking the pucks as needed, you can customize the MCON to fit your phone perfectly, no matter the camera bump or case situation.",
      "Many manufacturers also make MagSafe cases for non-MagSafe phones if you want to avoid adhering a disc to your phone.",
      "Our goal is to natively support iOS, Android, Xbox and PC/Mac. PlayStation is it's own thing and is a bit unknown at this point.",
      "MCON is designed to adapt to any smartphone. The only outliers are vertical flip phones (like Z-Flip or Razr), but based on feedback, we are working on designing different plates as an option that justifies the MagSafe puck further to the side. We will provide more updates on that as we develop it.",
      "* MCON will not work on your grandma's flip phone or any phone without bluetooth.",
      "Full size Hall-effect joysticks are an absolute must for controlled precision AND durability. These sticks are also MUCH less prone to stick drift, common on controllers like the Switch.",
      "MCONs silent buttons produce super quiet and fluid gameplay without disturbing your environment. We'll consider this campaign a success if MCON is banned from classrooms <3",
      "Light mode or dark mode. It's your choice.",
      "Since we reached our stretch goal on Kickstarter, Frosted Clear is available as a CROWDFUNDING EXCLUSIVE color! Kickstarter and IndieGoGo will be the only places you will ever be able to get this color.",
      "Measuring just 5.67 inches long, 2.67 inches wide, and under three-quarters of an inch thick, the MCON is compact enough to fit into any pocket, purse, or backpack. It charges via USB-C in 30 minutes and delivers weeks of gaming on a single charge.",
      "We're nerds, you're a nerd. Let's customize, modify, and repair the things we buy so that we can spend less and generate less waste. MCON can be taken apart with a simple TORX screwdriver so you can do whatever you want.",
      "Mockup packaging",
      "Below is our estimate for standard shipping charges. Because this estimate is based on our expected volume for this campaign, it could be subject to change depending on the final result. These charges may also change if you add additional products during the survey process. We want to keep this process as simple and accurate as possible, while avoiding any false promise or unexpected charges.",
      "Taxes, Customs, and Duties:\nWe want to make sure the entire process is clear and straightforward. Here's what to expect:",
      "Unfortunately we are only able to support certain countries right now, as shipping and warrantying products in some countries is extremely difficult. If you do not see your country on the list, the product will likely not be available. Check back in just in case!",
      "Simply multiply the price you paid by the number of controllers you would like! For example: The super early bird tier is $99, if I wanted to purchase 3, I would pledge $297 for that tier. You can only purchase more at the price tier you backed at. You will be able to pick the color for each controller individually after the campaign is over!",

We went to several of the world\u2019s best manufacturers of premium casino cards and asked for the best materials they could provide. In the process of creating the ultimate travel deck, we tried out over 50 different high-end plastic materials. The materials were taken through scratch, bending and handling tests to identify the best candidate. Finally, we ended up with a premium \u2018casino quality\u2019 PVC that has all the properties we want for our deck.",

      "The Air Deck 3.0 shuffles easily",
      "We created the new designs for Air Deck 3.0 with the wonderful supportive feedback we\u2019ve received from our community. Despite their smaller width, the cards are as easy to read as standard sized decks. The full-sized length ensures that they also handle much like regular cards, and the narrower width makes the deck fit nicely in the palm of your hands.",

However, with this campaign we\u2019ve upped our commitment to the planet by planting one mangrove tree for every two decks sold with our tree planting partner, Eden Reforestation Projects.",
      "Mangrove trees are one of the most effective tools to bind CO2 to the soil, thus preventing it from escaping into the atmosphere. A mangrove tree can sequester up to a ton of carbon dioxide by the time it reaches 40 years old.

This refreshed design isn\u2019t just an upgrade; it\u2019s a game-changer, packed with innovative features that push survival multi-tools to the next level. Its cutting-edge architecture harnesses smart geometry to unlock unique solutions for everyday challenges - redefining what a compact multi-tool can do.",
      "Designed and engineered for maximum functionality in an ultra-compact design, Geekey 2.0 is built to be just the right size - small enough to carry effortlessly, yet versatile enough to handle what matters most.",
      "Inspired by years of feedback, we\u2019ve integrated next-level survival features, including an \"emergency whistle\" and the innovative \"tool + fuel\" capability - seamlessly pairing Geekey 2.0 with the iconic J5 mini Bic\u00ae lighter, one of the world\u2019s most common and trusted lighters since the 1970s. Thank you for checking out this project and for being part of the journey to bring Geekey 2.0 to life. Let\u2019s make this a reality - enjoy!",
      "Geekey 2.0's design is a result of pushing the boundaries of art and engineering by paying attention to every small detail while vigorously testing the abilities of the design intent. Geekey 2.0 adopts the design language of it's predecessor while moving forward with a fresh new innovation. The simplicity of this single metal part multi-tool balances a holistic design approach while continuing the plan of using a manufacturing method in an unconventional way - the result is a beautiful tool that provides beautiful solutions.",
      "Before continuing, we had to give a nod to our first product, the Original Geekey Multi-tool. With over 350,000 units sold world wide, multiple design awards, 5,200+ five star reviews and a 4.6 star average rating on Amazon, we knew we had something special. We are now ready to replicate this beauty in an entire new form factor with Geekey 2.0 - Keeping all the innovative functional geometry with the design cues in tact, while adding new innovative features described in this campaign.",

Note: The lighter must slide out when using the bottle opener.",
      "Integrated towards the end portion is a sharp ENCLOSED CUTTER blade that is positioned to slice through anything pulled through the slot. The recessed blade is angled to wedge and cut through material when pulled through. Since the blade is enclosed, it is TSA compliant (without the lighter) making it an easy companion to fly with and take anywhere.",
      "A CLOSED BOLT WRENCH is integrated on both sides of Geekey 2.0 which will adapt to both imperial and metric hex bolt sizes. The front fits imperial hex bolt sizes 7/16\", 3/8\", 5/16\", 1/4\", 3/16\", and 1/8\" and the back fits metric hex bolt sizes M8 (13mm also 1/2\"), M6 (10mm), M5 (8mm), M4 (7mm), M3.5 (6mm), M2.5 (5mm), M2 (4mm), and M1.6 (3mm). With the closed hex bolt wrenches positioned in the center, it provides adequate leverage when tightening or loosening hex head bolts.",
      "Geekey 2.0 has an EMERGENCY WHISTLE integrated on the bottom side making it perfect for many different situations. The blown air passes through a small channel on the bottom and exits the bottle opener hole making a high frequency pitch when the air is cut. The top finger tone hole provides two pitch ranges when the hole is open or covered. The lighter must be removed, but can move in and out to create a \"kazoo\" effect if desired. Note: Interesting fact we discovered...it is a US federal law for all water vessels (including paddleboards and kayaks) to carry a sound-producing device like a whistle while on the water...this is primarily for safety purposes to signal distress or intentions to other boaters.",
      "Insert any 1/4\" or 4mm hex bit into the BIT DRIVER hex hole at the base of Geekey 2.0 to turn it into a full functioning screw driver. The recessed staggered hex holes allow full engagement of both universal hex sizes for ultimate versatility.",
      "The foundation of the Geekey 2.0 design all started with the form factor of the J5 mini Bic\u00ae lighter. Geekey 2.0 is a tightly integrated LIGHTER DOCK sheath that provides a multi-tool dock to integrate with your lighter...making one compact solution. The lower inside has two small ribs that the lighter slides against when pushing the last part of the lighter inside. The ribs provide an \"interference fit\" making it just snug enough to stay in place, but loose enough to pull the lighter back out when needed. This creative solution truly provides the ability to have tool + fuel seamlessly fused together for any survival or casual use situation.",
      "Insert up to size 16 (AWG) gauge wire into the WIRE STRIPPER hole at the base of the multi-tool to the desired stripping point. Pull the wire out and the steep internal angled edge will cut and strip the wire sheathing.",
      "Along the length of Geekey 2.0 is a FILE that can be applied to most any material when needing to smooth it over. The file has additional side bevels along its edge to provide a maximum width of filing surface.",
      "Geekey 2.0 is equipped with a 3.2/3.3mm BIKE SPOKE KEY which is one of the most common sized spoke nuts. The end slot slides over the spoke and then onto the square spoke nut for engagement. Note: The recessed cutting blade is positioned far enough back for proper engagement of the spoke nut.",
      "The MULTI-FIT SCREW DRIVER tip is one feature we absolutely had to carry over from the first generation. The screw driver tip is unique and completely versatile in that it will turn many types of the most common screws in the world. The tip will fit #2/3 slotted, #2 square, #2/3 phillips, #2/3 slotted/phillips combo, and #2/3 square/phillips combo screws. This tip is handy when in a pinch to tighten or loosen most any common screw! Note: The tip is integrated at a 25 degree angle on the corner to maximize the clearance needed to reach a recessed screw. The tip is also positioned in a way that when Geekey 2.0 is placed on its base, the tip point will perfectly touch the surface for balance.",
      "The LANYARD HOLE is designed in at the base of Geekey 2.0 and adapts to many different sizes of standard keyring loops and lanyard tethers. Note: A helpful tip we've found when carrying on a keyring is to put a very small keyring loop between Geekey 2.0 and the main larger keyring...this provides additional flexibility if ever needed.",
      "One of the most common needs we've also found over the years is having the ability to quickly and conveniently open packages. The integrated SCORING TIP (also carried over from the first generation) is placed on the corner edge at a 25 degree angle to provide maximum clearance while cutting through packaging tape.",
      "The LID OPENER is an open notch integrated on the end of Geekey 2.0 that is designed to fit over the rounded corner of any medium, or large sized metal paint can lid. When the notch is placed over the rounded edge, simply rotate outward and the elliptical geometry will pry the lid open. Note: Just like any metal paint lid opener, you will need to move around the edge in multiple spots for full lid removal.",
      "Geekey 2.0 has MEASUREMENT features that include both an imperial (inch) ruler on the front, a metric (centimeter) ruler and a 90 degree protractor on the back. These measurement features are designed for \"quick checks\" when needing to verify, create or determine any sort of length or angle.",
      "Geekey 2.0 has the ability with the versatile screw driver tip design to accommodate a MULTI-HEAD FIT on most any type of screw head style. The tip will fit pan head, high-profile fillister head, flat head, binding head, oval head, hex head, round head, low-profile button head, and large diameter truss head.",
      "Geekey 2.0 has an open notch WIRE BENDER at the open end which can create tight angled bends in wire when needed. This feature most often might be utilized in a situation when needing to create a unique aid to help address a need.",
      "At the base of Geekey 2.0 is a small protruded tip that is a STAPLE PRY for removing staples from paper. Simply place the slotted opening over a staple and slide forward across the paper to remove the staple.",
      "Geekey 2.0 is designed to work WITH OR WITHOUT the J5 mini Bic\u00ae lighter. When the lighter is absent there is still full functionality in every single tool feature with no compromise in the strength or versatility...Geekey 2.0 is compact and can easily go wherever you take it.",
      "The J5 mini Bic\u00ae lighter comes in a variety of solid colors which will all fit in Geekey 2.0. From older generation colors to new, you can add any solid color you like!",
      "Designate multiple Geekey 2.0's for different places to keep with your lighters...boat bin has blue, camping box has green, tackle box has yellow, glove box has orange, ski bin has red...",
      "The possibilities are endless as to where Geekey 2.0 can go. It is small enough to be conveniently stored just about anywhere and makes a great gift for anyone in need of a quick, convenient tool. Note: the J5 mini Bic\u00ae lighter is not included with any perk, but can be bought just about anywhere in the world in any color.",
      "Geekey 2.0 was designed to be as small as possible to provide the ability to go anywhere. Geekey 2.0 easily fits in the palm of your hand and is non-obtrusive on a keychain. The size accommodates all the necessary tools and functions while remaining very small.",
      "The initial start was trying to design a multi-tool that could cover a lighter while keeping the design language of it's predecessor. The balance of facets, angles, proportions and curves were adopted while designing the functional features.",
      "The initial 3D printing began with a high resolution plastic photopolymer resin made by a process called Stereolithography (SLA).",
      "Once the design detail was refined, the prototypes were printed in stainless steel 316L with a process called Binder Jetting. The final process (the model seen in the videos) was 3D printed in 420 stainless steel with a process called DMLS (Direct Metal Laser Sintering), which provides both high tolerance accuracy and strength. With the metal models we tested out all functional features to verify they worked properly. One of the most critical measurements on Geekey 2.0 is the internal touch points where the J5 mini Bic\u00ae lighter is held in place. An INTERFERENCE FIT was created with two small internal ribs on the bottom inside of Geekey 2.0. The ribs provide two concentrated press points that allow the lighter to be held in place, but also removed.",
      "The metal 3D printed prototype shown above is our final verification DMLS model to test all fit, function and star in our videos. Note: The final production of Geekey 2.0 will have a smooth, crisp and bright flawless Stainless Steel finish. All 3D printed metal can not produce the finish resolution like MIM (Metal Injection Molding) will produce.",
      "Geekey 2.0 is designed to be as small as possible without sacrificing function. The overall dimensions are 61mm (2.4in) x 24mm (0.94in) x 16mm (0.63in) and weighing 1.5oz in solid Stainless Steel.",
      "We're ready to take Geekey 2.0 to the next level - transforming it from a concept prototype into a fully realized production product that expands the Geekey Multi-tool brand. Your pledge isn\u2019t just a contribution; it\u2019s a statement that Geekey 2.0 belongs in the market. With your support, we can bring this innovative tool to life and make everyday tasks easier and safer for people everywhere.",
      "With your pledge you will not only be receiving the first production run of Geekey 2.0, but will be contributing to all the costs involved including the production of the Metal Injection Molding (MIM) tooling, package die tooling, shipping, and the first production minimum batch order of both Geekey 2.0 and its packaging.",
      "With that said, let\u2019s build something great together!",
      "The below timeline represents the major milestones achieved and major milestones remaining to bring Geekey 2.0 to market. There are a lot of smaller steps in-between to cross the finish line, but the next high level milestone will be successfully raising funds for all production tooling and the first batch order.",
      "Carve Design is a product development studio driven by curiosity and a passion for turning bold ideas into reality. Founded by award-winning industrial designer Brad Sliger, the studio builds on over two decades of experience shaping the medical, fitness, sporting and cosmetic industries in the greater Seattle area.

A graduate of Western Washington University, he balances his love for design with a commitment to family, adventure, and creating products that are as beautiful as they are purposeful.",
      "This is our second crowdfunding project on IndieGOGO and with the tremendous success of our first Geekey Multi-tool reaching over 903% of our goal, we knew crowdfunding was the way to go. We believe using IndieGOGO for crowdfunding Geekey 2.0 is one of the best ways to raise funds because it not only provides access to a large, engaged community of backers, but also offers invaluable marketing exposure. By launching on IndieGOGO, we can gauge public interest and validate our product idea before committing to large-scale production. IndieGOGO fosters a sense of community, allowing us to interact with backers, receive feedback, and build a loyal customer base early on. Additionally, IndieGOGO's all-or-nothing funding model option ensures that we only receive the funds if we meet our goal, which helps mitigate the risk for both us and our backers. This approach makes it easier to raise the necessary capital while also generating buzz and excitement around our new product idea.",
      "There are many unforeseen risks in product development and while we have thoroughly vetted every possible issue, there are always unknown risks when creating something that has never been done before.",
      "The most challenging aspect of this project will be consistently hitting the extremely tight tolerance to hold the lighter in place when docked. We're using what is called an \"interference fit\" where it is snug enough to hold in the lighter, but not too snug so it can't be easily pulled out. Luckily the tolerance on the J5 Mini Bic\u00ae lighter is very consistent in size, but Geekey 2.0 will not have a lot of flex, so hitting the tolerance on the internal touch points will be key...no pun intended.",
      "Geekey 2.0 will be metal injection molded allowing these tight required tolerances to be very closely controlled. With metal injection molding we can consistently produce the exact same part over and over while hitting the tightly required docking constraints. We are working closely with the supplier to assure they understand this critical measurement must be consistently met to make this product feature successful.",
      "We completely understand if you can't contribute at this time, but that doesn't mean you can't help. Please feel free to spread the word by sharing! The more noise we can make, the better the chance we have to succeed! Please use the IndieGOGO share tools or any other way you see best to share!",

It raised nearly $500K in total funding with over 6,000 backers and went on to become the World's Most Successful Pocket knife selling over 30k units worldwide in its first year.  We're back on Kickstarter with a complete redesign of the B-2 Nano Blade, this time concealed inside a discreet military style sheath.  After 5 successful campaigns and early delivery each time, Bomber & Company is extremely proud to introduce the newest addition to our collection, the B-2 Dog Tag, a fully concealed nano blade pocket knife.",

      "Straight Edge Blade: The sharp flat ground straight edge is perfect for thin sharp precision slices and versatility of everyday use. The blade is also perforated to allow cutting and slicing of materials to not stick onto the blade itself. It provides a cleaner sharper cut.",
      "Sizing: Discrete conceal-ability is the definition of the B-2 Dog Tag. The full opened length is only 3.7inches and when closed, it stands at 2.75inches in length and less than 0.2 inches in thickness. The miniature size of the pocket knife means it can easily be hidden in any coin pocket, wallet, or worn around the neck as a standard dog tag.",
      "Weight: The ultralight weight of the B-2 Nano Blade comes in at less than 2oz making it the world's lightest, fully functional, 440Carbon black stainless steel tactical pocket knife.",
      "Materials: 440C black stainless steel allows B-2 pocket knives to be one of the strongest nano blades ever created by mankind. Rated at 58-60HRC the B-2 Dog Tag is extremely tough and will stay sharp for longer periods of use. 440C is a highly durable and corrosion resistant stainless steel. The B-2 Dog Tag can endure years of outdoor wear without extra maintenance to protect the blade from rusting.",
      "Butterfly Lock: The B-2 Dog Tag uses a custom designed double-sided butterfly lock. Safety was one of the main concerns when it comes to a nano blade/knife of this size. We wanted the design the be suitable for beginners as well as intermediate knife experts. The lock is released by squeezing both sides of the B-2 Dog Tag and engaged automatically when let go. This makes the knife design much more robust than traditional smaller blades which are just folding with no locks. The user can feel and hear the tactile sound and click on the lock.",
      "Durability Tested: While designing the B-2 Dog Tag, we made sure to leave ZERO wiggle room. Once locked into place, the blade is completely tight and will not move. It was incredibly difficult engineering this, as the B-2 Dog Tag is very small in size. We made sure to trial and error fractions of a millimeter to finally get the B-2 Dog Tag to hit perfection.",

We've sold over 145k units, generating $7.5 million in revenue across the United States and Canada and we're here to bring our latest idea to life, the mmWave smart switch.",
      "If you already know what a smart switch is and just want to get into the details, feel free to skip this part.",
      "You may be asking yourself, \"what is a smart switch?\". Great question.",
      "Smart switches are normal looking light switches that have a wireless radio built into them that communicates with a hub or gateway to turn your lights on/off or dim. They can be used as normal switches and blend in with your aesthetics. The main benefit here is that someone who isn't familiar with your smart home can use the switch like normal and never know it's part of your home automation.",
      "If you don't know what a hub/gateway is, don't worry, we'll help! More on that at the end of this section.",
      "Here's an example of how a smart switch is used remotely (using the Aeotec SmartThings Hub):",
      "Don't have a hub?",
      "We've got you covered. Our recommendation for the easiest setup is going to be using Aeotec's SmartThings Hub, which has a very simple, but powerful app. Simply select the, \"Beginner Bundle\" Perk and we'll ship you the hub right away so you can get started before this switch even launches.",
      "Below we'll show you what this will look like within the Samsung SmartThings app to give you an idea of how the main features shown above come to life and give a further explanation into each element of the switch. Of course, this product will also be supported on Home Assistant (ZHA & Zigbee2MQTT) and Hubitat.",
      "Human Presence Detection",
      "The entire reason we created this switch was because we were tired of the traditional Passive Infrared (PIR) sensor switches. How many times have you found yourself sitting at a computer and your lights turn off because no motion was detected? Or better yet, have the lights ever shut off on you mid-Reddit browsing on the toilet in your bathroom and you have to waive your hands to try to get the light to turn on?",
      "Finally, from a security side, have you ever wanted the peace of mind knowing your children are in their rooms sleeping?",
      "Where a typical Passive Infrared (PIR) motion sensor detects a heat signature moving across its field of view, Millimeter Wave (mmWave) uses 24 GHz radar and onboard processing to monitor the presence of people in a space. While a PIR sensor can\u2019t detect a person once they stop moving, a mmWave sensor recognizes that a person has entered the space and will continue to identify that they are there until it identifies them leaving the area. More on mmWave technology at the end of the listing.",
      "Animated RGB LED Bar Notifications",
      "The LED Bar on the right side of the switch can be used as a, \"heads-up display\" to alert you of various triggers. For example, you can have the switch LED Bar pulse purple every morning at 9:30 to remind you to take your medicine. Another popular example is to have the LED Bar turn red when your alarm system is armed and green when it is unarmed. Finally, be notified of severe weather by having your LED Bar turn orange and chase as shown below.",
      "With individually addressable LED's, a full color spectrum, and over 15 different animations, the sky is truly the limit in what you can notify yourself of.",
      "Multi-Tap Scene Control",
      "Imagine controlling your entire house at the touch of a button. With multi-tap scene control, you can setup various, \"scenes\" that will activate based on how you tap the switch. For example, let's say you want to run a, \"bedtime\" scene when you go to bed where if you double-tap down on your light switch, all of your lights turn off, your doors lock, your garage doors close and the temperature is set to 68.",
      "With 24 different button combinations, you can setup virtually any scene you'd like. From turning on movie lights, to locking the doors, rest assured, this switch allows full control at your fingertips.",
      "Smart Bulb Mode",
      "Control all your smart bulbs directly from your switch by using, \"Smart Bulb Mode\". SBM locks in full power to the smart bulb and uses digital commands to turn on/off/dim (or change colors) of the smart bulb. No more covering up the switch with tape to keep your smart bulbs powered!",
      "This switch is a powerhouse of features. With over 60 parameters, you can customize it to your personal preferences. Below are the current features and specs - if these change, we will let you know.",
      "NOTE: The final switch may include lux monitoring which would add a tiny sensor at the bottom of the switch near the air-gap. We kept it out right now because we wanted to test it first before implementing it. This will not add to the final cost on this listing.",
      "FEATURES",
      "SPECS",
      "NOTE: These specs are based off our Blue Series 2-1 Switch, which we plan to model this switch off of. They are subject to change and we will let you know if they do.",
      "For indoor use. Specifications subject to change without notice due to continuing product improvement.",
      "This project has an amazing US based team (shown above) as well as an experienced R&D team that spans across Canada and SE Asia. Together, we've built and sold over 145k units equating to over $7.5 million USD, but we're still the small, responsive company we were from the start, equally as passionate about smart homes and the technology that goes into them. We love working alongside our thriving community of smart home owners to put the best products in our own homes and we can't wait to start working on this product. Thank you for your support and we look forward to chatting with you online or seeing you at trade-shows.",
      "Eric H. - Founder\nEric M. - Founder\nCourtney W. - Operations",
      "Each project we embark on has a special codename, and this one is no different. The inspiration for this project came from a Tweet by Linus, the creator of Linus Tech Tips. In the Tweet, he expressed frustration with the performance of a competitor's switch (there's much more to the story, but you can investigate that on your own).",
      "As longtime admirers of Linus and his work, we were disappointed to see him lose some enthusiasm about the capabilities of an automated home. So we've made it our mission to create the ultimate switch to work with Home Assistant (among others) to ensure it integrates seamlessly into Linus's setup. We're thrilled to partner with all of our supporters and we're confident this amazing switch will bring Linus renewed faith in the smart home industry. We can't wait for the day when he raves about our latest innovation.",
      "Below are some screenshots from how the switch should show up on various hub/gateways. They are taken from how our current Blue Series 2-1 Switch shows up, so these should be pretty accurate.",
      "Samsung / Aeotec SmartThings",
      "Here's how the switch should show up in SmartThings (and how our Blue Series 2-1 switch currently does):",
      "The left side shows the main device control menu where you can remotely turn on/off or dim the switch, whereas the right side shows the various settings that are configurable on the switch.",
      "Hubitat",
      "As with SmartThings, all capabilities will be exposed on the Hubitat platform. This includes all of their hubs (C4-C8). Here's how the switch would show up in Hubitat:",
      "Home Assistant",
      "This will also work with both ZHA and Zigbee2MQTT.",
      "If you're unfamiliar about millimeter wave, don't feel bad, it's relatively new to the smart home space. However, it's been used in a lot of really cool products, some of which we use daily.",
      "Probably the most common use-case is within cars. These are the sensors that can detect dynamic driving conditions (distance from moving vehicles, how many vehicles are around you, etc).",
      "Image Source: https://www.ti.com/sensors/mmwave-radar/automotive/overview.html",
      "PIR (Passive Infrared) vs mmWave Radar Sensors",
      "PIR Sensors are the current solution to motion detection and have been used since the 1970's and can commonly found in wall switches, sensors, and light fixtures. PIR works by monitoring the change in the infrared light radiating from an object in its field of view.",
      "This means that if the object is stationary (ie: typing at your desk, sleeping and, yes, sitting on the toilet), the sensor will not pick up a radiation change and therefore think you're not present.",
      "mmWave works by using radar (the Doppler principle) to determine the objects motion, speed and even direction. In the case of this switch, the sensor will transmit a 24 GHz waveform which will reflect off an object that is in the sensor's field of view. This reflected waveform is received by the radar transceiver and will have a frequency difference referred to the Doppler frequency (think Doppler radar used for weather) and will give the exact position of the object in the field of view.",
      "This is important because radar will constantly detect the object, even if it's still, which is the limitation of PIR (which again, tries to detect the change of temperature which won't happen if you're still).",
      "Said in simple terms, PIR detects only motion, while mmWave detects motion and presence.",
      "Examples in the Smart Home",
      "Bringing this technology to the smart home space is exciting and has a ton of amazing implications.",
      "Smart Home Solver created a video talking about a standalone sensor that he tested that goes over real life examples that can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVjrgQSWlLI",
      "Here are some of the use-cases for your smart home:",

      "You asked, let's make this happen!",
      "Due to the overwhelming success of the Zigbee version (fully funded in just over 24hrs), we will be creating a Z-Wave 800 Series equivalent if we can get the funds up to $325,000. This will allow us to cover the remaining R&D, certifications, etc.",
      "IF WE AREN'T ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE Z-WAVE SWITCH, WE WILL REFUND YOU.",
      "At this time, we plan on most of the features that are promised above to be available on the Z-Wave version. If anything changes, we will make an announcement.",

      "We understand that a sports car is not only a symbol of speed, but also a masterpiece of streamlined design and exquisite craftsmanship. Therefore, in the design of 2.0, we have adopted a more rounded shape, extracting the lines of the streamlined curves of a sports car to give it a more restrained and classic look.",
      "The interior is inspired by the engine compartment of a sports car, which is reflected in the Motor Zero 2.0's trendy and technological look and feel.",
      "The rear design features a unique breathing light that mimics the design of a sports car's taillight, which not only enhances the product's trendy punk feel, but also adds a futuristic technological touch.",
      "The razor is an important companion in your daily life, and we are still adhering to the design principle of easy portability, not only to maximize its power in a limited size. At a glance, you will be attracted by his mesmerizing design.",
      "Our innovative addition of a metal mirror design on the outside of the top cover is not only aesthetically pleasing, but is also more suitable for business people to use while traveling without having to fumble around looking for a mirror. Enjoy a hassle-free shaving experience anytime, anywhere.",
      "The Motor Zreo 2.0's body, head assembly, and top cover, all feature a strong magnetic design. The components can be replaced very easily. And you can disassemble each part for cleaning at will",
      "The Motor Zero 2.0 has been upgraded to 9,000 rpm, which will allow for a faster and cleaner shave.",
      "The Motor Zero 2.0 utilizes dual polymer batteries while maintaining a compact size. This not only extends usage time, but also reflects our pursuit of performance and portability.",
      "In order to improve user experience, Motor Zero 2.0 is equipped with an LED display, which allows users to easily check the remaining battery level without worrying about the embarrassment of low battery.",
      "Meanwhile, considering the convenience of traveling, we designed a travel lock to avoid accidental touching of the product during carrying and protect the internal parts from damage.",
      "We have precisely controlled the craftsmanship of each part to make the Motor Zero 2.0 IPX7 full body waterproof. Combined with the strong magnetic component design, any part can be easily disassembled and cleaned.",

    "allParagraphs": [
      "Help us stop deaths, deforestation, poverty & emissions - all by replacing firewood.",
      "Our Technology is called the Spark, and it turns organic waste into clean energy and fertiliser.\nThe perfect solution to replace Firewood while empowering communities.",
      "Firewood is causing a massive problem for people in low/middle-income countries, as well as for the environment at large. This campaign will go towards funding a mould, which will make our technology a fraction of the cost per unit, which means more accessible to millions more people.\n\nTo Support Our Mission of ENDING this Crisis, Purchase a 'Perk'.\nALL the Money Raised through this Campaign goes Directly into the Moulds for the Spark.",
      "Across the globe, 2.3 billion people - over a quarter of humanity - rely on firewood for daily cooking, according to UN estimates. In rural Mozambique, where we have been prototyping (seen in the image above), most families earn less than $200 equivalent per year, a stark reality backed by World Bank poverty data. All they can afford is firewood; There are no alternatives at this income level. Let me explain why this is a problem.\nWhy cooking on firewood is the single biggest social and environmental crisis in today\u2019s world.",
      "The health effects are the most devastating.\nThe World Health Organization reports that firewood smoke kills 3.1 million people every year from several diseases such as COPD; Ischemic Heart Disease; Lung Cancer; Strokes; Pneumonia. 230,000 of these deaths are children under the age of five, who die from childhood pneumonia. To put that into perspective, it is equivalent to a double story, A380 Airbus with over 600 young children on board, crashing.\nEvery.\nSingle.\nDay.\nLeaving no survivors.\n\nUntil we can reliably produce the Spark, these children will keep dying, and families will keep suffering. With your support we can change this.",
      "Another extremely underrated impact of this crisis, is the time and energy which it steals, from women and children in particular. The World Food Programme notes that just the act of simply collecting firewood and preparing fires, consumes multiple hours daily for rural families. Time that could be spent on education, generating income, or literally anything else more productive. This is probably one of the most successful forms of oppression which still exists today!\nChildren miss school to help their mothers collect wood, killing future opportunities.\nFamilies spend less time on productive work, killing the hope of escape. \nI believe that everyone deserves equal opportunity in this world, that is why the Spark needs to exist. Let's give families back their time.",
      "All this and we haven't even mentioned, the environmental impacts.\nEmissions are a global burden. UN Environment Programme data shows firewood cooking contributes to over 2% of global climate-damaging emissions. This seemingly harmless act releases more black carbon, than the entire aviation industry. This accelerates climate change, hitting the poorest hardest.\nOn top of that, the obvious one. Deforestation. The World Resources Institute estimates 10 million hectares of forest are lost every year to firewood. About 14,000 soccer/football fields, vanishing every day. This erodes ecosystems and livelihoods in regions like Mozambique, and is only getting worse with increasing populations.",
      "For the past 8 months, we have been prototyping in central Mozambique (Catandica), fine-tuning our technology with a singular focus in mind.\nMaking the most accessible clean energy technology in the world, so that everyone - regardless of their geographic, educational, or financial situation - can live free from firewood.",
      "The fundamental technology is known as 'Anaerobic Digestion'.\nIt is the process of using methanogenic bacteria, to break down organic waste, in the absence of oxygen, to release Bio-Methane which we can capture and use for cooking. \nThis bio-methane is what makes the biogas combustible and a useful fuel.\n(Fun fact: methane is what is being used to power modern day, orbital rockets!)\nThe organic waste after being broken down is called 'Digestate'/'Fertiliser', and is similar to organic compost - with the added benefits of mirco-bacteria, which is essential for healthy soils.",
      "Albert Einstein once said \"Make everything as simple as possible, but not any more\".\nWe have taken this to heart when designing the Spark, to create the most affordable, robust, and easy-to-use clean energy technology.",
      "With your help, the Spark will completely replace the need for firewood, for good.",
      "Since September 2024, we have been prototyping with 10 units in central Mozambique .\nThis program has lead to a number of valuable insights, both on the physical design of the Spark, in terms of: gas storage size; necessary tank volume; inlet-outlet height ratios etc. \nBut also many learnings in terms of human behavior: Feeding frequencies; struggles; miss understandings; un-forseen needs etc. \nAll of which we have taken into account when designing the Spark.",
      "We are looking for \u20ac4000 to finance the moulds for the Spark. \nWith this we will be able to dramatically lower the cost of producing each unit (from over \u20ac300/unit to under \u20ac200). which will make it much more accessible for rural Mozambican Families.",
      "If you were fortunate enough to be born in a world, where the way you cook is not threatening yours or your children's life. Where the way you cook does not hold you in a state of poverty and kill any hope of escaping. Then I beg you, please, share our story with a friend or your network.\nIf you are in a stable enough financial position, then I also ask you to contribute to the development of the Spark. Let's end to this crisis for good. \nYou Have the Power to Ignite the Change.",

As you may recall, it was around the same time that US-China relations were not at their best, the pandemic was out of control with new deadly strains, and the supply chain experienced disruptions globally. We certainly felt that stress through the delayed shipments of raw materials and high import fees.",
      "Nevertheless, we battled against all of that for our first launch. We had no prior investors, significant budget, or experience producing \"Smart Heated Apparel\" since it was the first of it's kind and still is to this day. Whatever obstacle was thrown our way or fell upon our heads, we simply extracted the kinetic friction as energy and powered through with determination.",

The one and only new thing is the luxurious style of Vegan Leather Gloves, Slim Winter Jackets, and Vests, which we have developed with a focus on medical conditions during our R&D phase.",
      "All the pictures you see use the final material, PrimaLoft's sustainable fabric, performing as we expect - in a synergy of our unique and stylish designs with Smart Heated Wearable Technology. All that is waiting right now is for us to give the green light and papers to our manufacturer to produce the units and bring warmth to people, even in the world's coldest areas.",

      "Unique automatic watches inspired by wildlife",
      "As the tallest mountain in Africa and the highest free-standing mountain in the world, Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania is a natural wonder to behold. Wildlife teems around the base of Kilimanjaro and among them are the Big Five game animals such as the leopard, rhino, elephant, African buffalo, and lion. A proud and powerful creature, the lion is the basis of the design concept for our first watch from the Chaka Collection.",
      "In 2018, our watch designer Ricky, who traveled on a ten-day plus adventure trip to Tanzania, Africa.  He took part in a local Safari tour, went to several national parks to see wildlife, and spent a few nights at several famous camp sites under the guidance of professional driver guides.  This trip allowed him to witness numerous wild animals with our own eyes, including of course, the lion. This stimulated our thinking and creativity, and together we wanted to create a watch brand inspired by wildlife.",
      "Okepo's logo is inspired by the flamingo, which can also be found in Tanzania. On our logo, the flamingo\u2019s shape is simplified and filled with bright orange, representing the vitality and vigor of African wildlife.",
      "During the trip, we had made initial sketches, and since some details had to be measured with the help of a caliper, we ended up with detailed hand-sketchings when we returned to our studio in Hong Kong.",
      "Chaka Collection contains six different colorways and combinations to meet individual tastes. The case and bracelet of K04 and K06 feature a special highlight; a destress polish was applied to show and emphasize the theme of a wildlife environment.",
      "//Raw steel case - Green sunray dial - Mint green bezel insert",
      "//Raw steel case - Light blue sunray dial - Greyish blue bezel insert",
      "//Raw steel case - Dark blue sunray dial - Dark blue bezel insert",
      "//Antique steel case - Ash brown sunray dial - Dark grey bezel insert",
      "//Light Gun case - Dark blue sunray dial - Dark blue bezel insert",
      "//Light Gun case - Dark blue sunray dial - Dark blue bezel insert",
      "Chaka's bezel is inspired by the front silhouette of a lion, presenting a rugged, wild, and fierce image. The unique bezel shape is equipped with external helical teeth that allows wearers to turn the bezel with ease. In addition, the insert ring is made of strong K1 glass, and then matched with SuperLuminova's luminous coating.",
      "Bezel Feature",
      "Technical Drawing",
      "The lion's tail was the inspiration for the watch hands. The hour hand is in the shape of a rounded diamond, with sharp chamfers made by CNC cutting process on both sides of the hour hand.",
      "The hand window is filled with Super-Luminova so you can still read the time clearly in the dark African wilderness.",
      "The Crown is deeply etched with Okepo's logo and filled with bright orange. This eye-catching highlight of crown is symbolic as the watch\u2019s signature.",
      "Technical Drawing of Crown",
      "The case back is cast in relief with a vivid lion. A lot of hard work was put into creating a delicate and detailed exterior in which initial hand sketching, painting, and multiple corrections to the 3D drawings took two weeks. After the process of casting the mold and modifying the mold twice, we finally achieved the result that we were satisfied with.",
      "Super Luminova is another important feature of the watch. The applied indexes on the insert ring, watch hands, and dial are all coated with Super Luminova. After absorbing UV light for a period of time, it can maintain long-term luminous performance, ensuring that users can still clearly read the time in dark environments, such as in the outdoors or while diving.",
      "The dial is a double-layered with a slight gradient of sunburst polishing, which is quite eye-catching and pleasing to the eye. The surface is inlaid with 12 super large, three-dimensional indexes. The applied indexes are made to a super high thickness of 0.8mm, and the hollow part in the middle is filled with Super Luminova's luminous powder.",
      "The ultra-thin Miyota 9039 automatic movementpowers the Chaka. The movement of this Cal. 9039 delivers the premium level of Miyota performance. It is equipped with a power reserve function of up to 42 hours; and a vibration frequency of 28800 per hour. These features make it a reliable and accurate watch. The rotational flow of Miyota's rotor is also the reason why we choose this movement. This time, we deliberately did not choose a movement with a calendar disc, so that the design of the watch is more concise and prominent.",
      "Chaka comes a small curved Sapphire crystal. A thickness of 3.7mm meets the water-resistant structure requirements of the diving case. Sapphire Crystal is scratch-resistant, and its bottom is treated with three anti-reflective coatings. The coating is blueish, which makes reading the time clearer and the appearance more sophisticated.",
      "The vintage-effect leather roll box is Chaka's packaging box. We deliberately chose gray-brown leather with a destree texture, drawing inspiration from the bark of the baobab tree found in Africa. The inner lining of the box is covered with a pleasing orange leather, echoing the Okepo logo color.",
      "TIMELINE\nIt took more than five months from the conception of the design concept to the completion of the campaign launch. During this time, the prototype was revised three times, and finally the design and appearance of the watch exceeded our requirements.",
      "Throughout the years, we have maintained good business partnerships with stable, reliable, and cooperative suppliers. This is one of the key reasons why we have been able to ensure  our promise of on-time delivery. The delivery would be in April 2023.",
      "Two Year Warranty//  Our watches come with a 2-year warranty. In case of a defect during this time period, your watch will be repaired free of charge.",
      "Shipping // We will ship to anywhere in the world, with the exception of the following: Azerbaijan, Barbados, Belarus, French Guiana, Honduras, Mongolia, Peru, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Solomon Islands.",
      "Please Note// You will need to provide a residential/office address. We will be unable to deliver to P.O. boxes.",
      "Delivery will be via EMS or Fedex and your tracking number will be sent via inbox message, 2-3 days after the item parcel is shipped. If you have any queries, please do not hesitate to contact us directly: info@ovd.com.hk",
      "During our nearly two-week national park safari tour, Chaduu took care of our driving, eating, and safari wildlife guide. A real man, he is a human dictionary who is really familiar with African wildlife and has excellent eyesight and a deep understanding of animals. What impressed us greatly was his professional ability to make safety assessments in the field. He also made us understand more about his peoples\u2019 high regard for nature and made us learn and really recognize more about Tanzania.",

      "New Writing Experience/Stylish premium writing instrument.Equipped with pen clip and window breaker",
      "I've been thinking, what should I say when we launch the new project? \"Hello backers, we are the Comandi team\"? Or \"Nice to meet you guys, this is our new project\"? .....",
      "No, none of that! When the project is going to launch, the first thing I want to say is: thank you, backers! Without the millions of backers around the world, there wouldn't be a chance for us to write these words here and launch the project! So, all of our backers are our lucky stars! And we are looking forward to bringing a lucky experience for every backer with our new project!",
      "Next, Let me introduce our new project to you \u2014Titanium 2-in-1 bolt pen. Maybe you will wonder what\u2019s special about a pen. Now, let\u2019s take a look at this pen.",
      "As you can see, it looks very stylish and technological, and the entire body of the pen glows with the unique metallic luster of titanium alloy. Whether you are a businessman or an outdoor enthusiast, its high-class, cool temperament will surely be a perfect match for your status!",
      "In terms of practicality, it combines the functions of writing and window breaker, a smooth writing experience, and an escape tool in times of emergency, which can meet the needs of your daily life and work in many aspects!",
      "More importantly, it is made of Gr5 titanium material, no matter how long it is used, it will not be bad, nor rust deformation, it can be said that such a bolt pen can replace your usual hundreds of pens!",
      "As a bolt pen, writing is the most basic function, we have equipped this bolt pen with a special refill (German brand - Schneider G2), which has very good writing smoothness and is very easy to buy in daily shops, you can change the refill to different colors to meet the rich writing needs.",
      "Twist the bolt device of the pen body to the bottom slot, then you will write smoothly,  when you're done using it, you can twist the bolt mechanism to the center to retract the nib and lock the mechanism in place.",
      "When you need to replace the refill, twist the lower part of the pen body to remove the replacement refill smoothly.",
      "The top of the pen body, takes the tungsten steel design of the window breaker, to protect you in critical moments, it can break the car glass, or other windows, in time to escape all the dangers, to protect the safety of life. In addition, after working at night, if we meet some dangerous people or when the other side makes some dangerous moves, we can also use this tungsten steel head to protect ourselves and allow ourselves to escape.",
      "Twist the bolt mechanism of the pen body to the top slot to activate the window breaker function, and when you are done using it, twist the bolt mechanism to the center to retract the window breaker and lock the device. Window Breaker is also very smooth and won't hurt your fingers. You don't have to worry about safety issues.",
      "The whole pen body is designed with different shapes of grooves, which can play a good anti-slip role, even if your palm has water or sweat, it will not affect you to hold the pen body tightly. And this design can make your grip more comfortable, there is a wonderful feeling of massaging the finger joints, although this is a little exaggerated, but the fact can really feel, haha.",
      "The E-bolt action mechanism on the body of the pen has three twist directions corresponding to three slots. The top slot enables the window breaker, the middle slot corresponds to a locking device, and the bottom slot enables the writing function. When we designed the slots, we took into account the strength of the connection between the spring and the bolt, thus ensuring that the bolt is very silky smooth.",
      "The pen is designed with a pen clip, so after using this bolt pen, you can always clip it to your pocket, book, backpack, etc. The elasticity of the pen clip has also been adjusted several times to ensure that it can easily hold things as well as not fall off.",
      "Next to the bolt action mechanism, we have added a Tritium Slot for the luminous vials. The luminous vials not only give the appearance a more technological look, but it is also very convenient for you to find this pen in the dark.",
      "We offer luminous vials as an additional option. Luminous vials make light by absorbing light. They can be charged under a bright light source and will glow in the dark for some time. This option is generally less expensive than tritium tubes and may be suitable for those who do not need constant glow or are looking for a cost-effective option. However, the brightness and duration of light depend on the amount and intensity of light absorbed.",
      "sturdy and durable\uff1a Titanium's corrosion resistance and high hardness make this bolt pen not only resistant to all common erosion factors, but It can also ensure that the pen will not easily break under any circumstances, even if it is accidentally dropped on the road and run over by a car, it will not break.",
      "Even though it is made of metal, the weight of the whole pen is only 24g, and the design of the overall weight follows the principle of \"light on the top and heavy on the bottom\", which ensures that you can get a good sense of balance when writing, and your hand won't get tired.",
      "The whole bolt pen is very small, only 5.24IN/133mm in length, and the diameter of the pen body is 0.34IN/9.8mm, which fully meets the needs of daily carrying with the design of the pen holder. Whether it's writing at your desk, signing meeting minutes, or marking outdoors, it's easy to put in your pocket and always at your service.",
      "While you're racking your brain and thinking about your work, the bolt action mechanism of the pen can be a little fidget toy, Get inspired during the up-and-down twist to make work more enjoyable! Or you can turn the pen and let the pen body arc beautifully over your knuckles, and even if it accidentally flies out you won't know to worry about breaking it!",
      "So far, I believe you must have a very detailed understanding of this pen. So next, I want to tell you why we designed such a pen.",
      "As a professional company that has been plowing into the EDC field for many years, we have an excellent team of designers, a well-equipped manufacturing plant, and a very insightful operation team, and we have also successfully launched several outdoor EDC tool projects on Kickstarter, each successful delivery is not only a surprise to all the backers, but also a great affirmation of our company.",
      "So, we are committed to the EDC field, adhere to the original intention, the pursuit of innovation, and expect to give more backers around the world to create more outstanding and innovative EDC tools, so that every backer can feel our heart and professionalism.",
      "Before launching this bolt pen, we did a lot of market research work, and also carefully studied every titanium pen project published on Kickstarter, in-depth understanding of each backer's experience.",
      "Every project was wonderful! but there is always a design need to improve in one way or another. For example: the pen body is too thick and bulky, the pen body is not added to the anti-slip design, resulting in an uncomfortable grip, the bolt device is not stable enough, and so on. Inspired by this, we decided to design a titanium pen that was superior in every way to our innovative spirit.",
      "After months of communication with members of the company's design team, during which we overturned several sketches, we finally designed such a stylish and practical titanium bolt pen with a very comfortable experience. When we gave the design drawings to our factory's CNC Engineer, they also showed us real samples very efficiently. Finally, the gun bolt pen shown to you on the page is simple and atmospheric in design, more practical in function, and the CNC processing technology makes this gun bolt pen more exquisite!",
      "The whole casing of the bolt pen takes CNC machining, this process can ensure that every part of the bolt pen is very delicate, no matter whether it is the groove of the pen body or the streamlined feeling of the whole pen body, it gives people a very comfortable experience in visually and tactilely.",
      "We are excited to offer free worldwide shipping to all our backers. With this perk, you can have your Bolt-action Pen delivered to your doorstep without any extra charges. We aim to provide a seamless and hassle-free experience, allowing you to fully enjoy your Bolt-action Pen without incurring additional costs.",
      "Thanks so much for taking the time to learn about our project. Your support is essential for this project. We will do our best to produce a perfect product.",

      "The original blend of Delessa chocolate spread was created more than 15 years ago to meet an important need: chocolate treats for our restricted diets. The creator of Delessa chocolate spreads struggled with health issues. There was literally nothing on the market to satisfy the need for treats, especially chocolate, without ingredients such as flour, gluten, dairy, and some type of sugar or an undesirable sugar alternative which spikes glucose or causes side-effects. Even today it is still difficult to find healthier options for chocolate treats.",
      "Our intent is not only to fill in the gap where other treats leave off, but also to introduce our enlightened chocolate as a delicious alternative treat for anyone and everyone. By launching Delessa chocolate with your support we can Spread the Love.",
      "Our intent by maintaining control of our small company is to maintain the high quality of ingredients and our commitment to offering at an affordable price our delicious and satisfying alternatives to treat-seekers who need to avoid the carbs, sugars, additives, dairy, gluten, commonly found in most treats - or who simply don't want the \"junk\" anymore.",
      "Additional blends of chocolate as well as other delightfully yummy spreads are in our plans for the future. We want to continue to develop new chocolate and other snack spreads that are better for you than what is out there (we are working on a chocolate blend without coconut and also a slightly sweet pumpkin seed spread that has an easier consistency to spread and to eat than what is currently available) Our goal is to give our customers delicious, fresh, and satisfying treats and snacks without the compromises or concessions we face with regular treats. By creating a community through crowdfunding, we can get your input on products we develop.",
      "We may face challenges in our early stages with regard to scaling production from a small to a large scale -- we are planning ahead so that we can mitigate these challenges as much as possible. We've managed for a year so far so we're confident we'll be here for you!",
      "We began fulfillment in early 2023. Currently we have product in stock and ship within 48 hours of receiving an order.  If we experience any delays, we will provide detailed updates immediately so that you are kept in the loop! We will begin fulfillment on a first come first served basis, so orders that come in later in the campaign may not receive items until January.

Some will run out faster than others, although they are designed to last a full month, so the next shipment will be only what you need, automatically adjusting the costs, so you never pay too much and ensuring you always have what you really need and avoid accumulating unnecessary products and pay much more, being able to pause the shipment that month or only 1 or 2 of the 5 products if you need it, thus getting the best price in the short, medium and long term.",

His architectural projects include the new museum for Los Angeles County Museum of Arts, Porsche and BMW Research Centers in Stuttgart and Munich, as well as various high-rises in Florida and New York and the new building for the United Arab Emirates Mission to the United Nations. In 2018, Norbert founded his own studio called nominomis. Today, nominomis, is based in Chicago and focuses on the intersection of product design and architecture. The studio\u2019s work spans from various architectural project to product designs such as the lamp series Mr.Watt.

After extensive discussion and careful planning, we decided to change material from wood to plastic for various reasons: cost reduction for better affordability, longer lasting, more fun possibilities (customisation). We turned to crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter and Indiegogo once again \u2013 not only does it allow us to reach out to all of you who love innovative designs, but it also allows us to study market\u2019s reaction towards Mr.Watt and us to produce these little guys in bigger quantity. By pledging to pre-order your very own Mr.Watt before production, we can use your contributions to place the orders for all required components. These parts have a minimum order quantity required by manufacturers to get the right prices, so it\u2019s key that we reach the numbers needed.",

      "Crafted alongside a team of deep sea and underwater mechanical engineers, reVessel's products are tested to be leakproof and submersible. Additionally, each unit is reusable, modular, toxin-free and eco-friendly, replacing the 1460 sandwich bags a typical child's lunch could require annually. These containers add functionality to meals and a convenient way to develop healthy habits that frees us from relying on outsourcing food and single-use plastics while reducing exposure to toxins so that we can fully live.",
      "reVessel hopes to spark a ripple effect of healthy and sustainable change.",
      "Beyond the beautiful and versatile products, we intend to use our business to positively influence some of the world\u2019s challenges using long-lasting, premium materials. Much of our food produced in the US lacks nutrients and comes with as many as 700 chemicals. A portion of proceeds from reVessel sales goes back to protecting future generations by supporting farmers in growing regenerative food, rehabilitating our oceans and setting a new standard by offsetting our Company\u2019s entire carbon footprint.",
      "We are a team composed of engineers, designers, health professionals and even leakproofing gurus. We care so much about our planet and we are committed to developing products that are good for you and good for the planet.",

      "The next generation of the World\u2019s Most Spacious Pop-Up Dual Expandable Hardshell Rooftop Tent",
      "There are lots of exciting things to love about camping but setting up your tent is rarely one of them. Lugging it around while it\u2019s packed up can be quite a hassle and pitching it usually ends up being way more complicated than it should be.",
      "TEDPoP makes sleeping off the ground super easy and convenient. Just unfold it and you are ready to go! After you install TEDPoP once, you can use it to camp whenever and wherever you want!",
      "TEDPoP offers an enormous space allowing up to 5 people to lay down comfortably at once due to dual expandable panels on both sides of the tent.",
      "It offers a non-obstructed 360\u00b0all-around view that is generally not possible in the case of expandable rooftop tents due to their structure.",
      "Since there are 2 entrances, you can change the direction of the tent entry to any side that you prefer as well.",
      "Windows on all sides create an openness that exceeds regular closed-off tents.",
      "The \u201cStar View\u201d ceiling window opens up a beautiful view of the sky and stars.",
      "TEDPoP\u2019s tent skin material is applied with a high-density canvas fabric to maximize air permeability. Along with that, a fly material equipped with features complementing the canvas skin is used simultaneously to block UV and demonstrate perfect waterproof qualities.",
      "The super water-repellent premium canvas is a material newly coming to the fore in the tent industry and is a fabric used to draw oil paintings. Because it\u2019s an excellent moisture absorber, you won\u2019t have to worry about condensation forming inside the tent. As a material with self-waterproof features, it boasts durability that withstands even the strongest rains with ease.",
      "One of the annoyances commonly experienced in typical camping tents is \u201ccondensation.\u201d This refers to the phenomenon where the differences in indoor and outdoor temperatures cause the vapor in the air to turn into water drops within the tent. This process occurs frequently in general polyester material tents and gives a hard time to campers in hot or cold weather conditions.",
      "To solve this problem, TEDPoP has adopted a newly developed insulation method. By utilizing an insulated closed-cell structure with maximized insulation, we\u2019ve drastically minimized condensation, which was a fatal drawback of existing products. We have also developed the world\u2019s first thermally static composite panel (3 layers in the picture below) and are currently in process of getting a patent. The panel improves temperature-resistant stability while fundamentally blocking the persistent condensation of other rooftop tent products.",
      "Additionally, boosting air permeability by applying the high-density premium canvas fabric as the tent skin material has played a huge role in wiping out condensation as well.",
      "The exterior with a streamlined form that resembles a clamshell is crafted in an aerodynamic design. Such design structure minimizes wind resistance and is not only safe to use in strong winds, including typhoons, but also helps with fuel efficiency and noise while driving.",
      "TEDS has opted for ABS material instead of FRP used in average tents, embodying the pro-environment aspect, and at the same time, has grafted a condensation-preventing technology by applying insulating layers.",
      "Ref. FRP (Fiber Reinforced Plastic): Despite being plastic, this is a hybrid material made with a compound of various materials and is completely unrecyclable, which has become a major cause of environmental pollution and has led the recent related industries to drop its use.",
      "In addition to these features, the high-strength aluminum honeycomb panel doesn\u2019t alter its shape, even when faced with a weight load of 2000lbs. This is thanks to it utilizing the same material which is used to make aircraft wings, meaning that it\u2019s adapted for resulting in maximum durability.",
      "When you raise the cover to a certain height, the expanding force of the condensed gas strut bar increases, causing the hard shell to open automatically. Following the opened hard shell, the extension panels on both sides consecutively open by the movement of the link structure.",
      "Most hardshell rooftop tents on the market were optimized for a smaller group of people, from 1 to 4 people maximum. However,  TEDPoP allows up to 5 people to sleep comfortably inside. This is achieved through dual expandable panels that extend from both sides of the main panel. However, adopting such a structure would lengthen the cantilever as much as the extended panel\u2019s length, hindering the tent pitching, and the moment arm would also be lengthened, possibly becoming a shaky factor in durability aspects including stability and load capacity.",
      "The highlight of TEDPoP is that in order to overcome this obstacle, we have divided the extension panel to both ends of the main panel, and by reducing the moment arm, we facilitated high stability and even the convenience of a pop-up.",
      "TEDPoP is available in white and black colors. At the end of the campaign, we will send you a separate survey where you can select your colors.",
      "\"Dark Wine Red\" is the basic color of TEDPoP that you will receive.",
      "At the end of the campaign, we will send a separate survey from which you can choose other custom colors as shown in the picture above.",
      "***Please note that other custom colors aside from \"Dark Wine Red\" will only be available if there are 50 or above selections for that particular color based on the results of the survey.",
      "All rewards will include the following:",

      "Our rooftop tent comes with 1 ladder that you can attach to the desirable entrance and if you\u2019re looking to add an extra telescopic ladder in order to make use of both entrances, consider getting this extra add-on.",
      "Need extra storage for your stuff? With TEDS Shoe Rack climbing in and out of your rooftop tent becomes much more convenient!

For detailed information, please contact us to be advised on the customs clearance process and pick up (or arrange final transportation to your doorstep).",
      "Please note that shipping costs may vary depending on your location.",
      "What we want to create and provide is an unforgettable experience for anyone who is interested in camping and Overlanding. We spent months looking into various rooftop tents that are out in the market, especially on what kind of improvements can be made for a better user experience.",
      "Our conclusion is that common issues such as condensation and comfortability can be improved through better materials and enhanced designing, and the loss can be lowered by cutting out all unnecessary costs.",
      "Ultimately, we are confident that we can provide everyone who not only enjoys camping and Overlanding but has an interest in outdoor activities the best camping experience through our product. The starting point for this IndieGoGo is not limited to this rooftop tent but will be the beginning of a full line-up of products that are currently in design.",
      "Our team is fully committed to this IndieGoGo campaign. We\u2019ve spent nights and days working on this project and tested every possibility to deliver the best product in your hand. With the final prototype, we made sure everything is on the perfect track for mass production. Now, we are ready to manufacture and ship them out to you.",
      "My name is Ted Ko. I am a father of three children and the founder of TEDS. During my life, I have always enjoyed camping. In my late 30s, I came across some personally difficult times, and things were not working out. I took that time to spend more time with my family, and we decided to spend some time camping across New Zealand. We covered most parts of the country camping out in various types of rooftop tents. Spending time out in nature with loved ones truly helped me look back on myself and mentally secure myself to think and plan out my next steps. I wanted to share the experience and the feelings I had felt during camping with as many people as possible. After returning, I gained experience in the industry as a technical designer and soon started drafting my own original rooftop tent design.",
      "TEDS is now proud to present \u201cTEDPoP\u201d: a pop-up rooftop tent that will not only give you a great camping experience but also allow you to continue connecting and bonding with your loved ones wherever you go.",
      "We have many plans and products coming up, and your support will help us bring them to life. Your support in bringing this project to life means more than anything to us, and we wholeheartedly believe that we will be able to offer the experience and the feelings that we have felt and let you keep fulfilling your expedition dream.",
      "If the product has a defect caused by our manufacturing side, free exchange is available for 1 year.",
      "For failures from the problem of the product itself, free after-sales service is offered for 2 years.",
      "We understand that many of our backers start planning for trips when they back our project. We have been talking with global distribution companies and partners for months to make sure your \u201cTEDPoP\u201d reaches you on time.

Its innovative, patented preservation system uses an airtight seal to keep wine perfectly fresh for at least 7 days, as proven by blind taste tests carried out with 'Master of Wine' Richard Hemming, and independent laboratory testing at Bangor University.",
      "eto is easy to use - its unique design ensures every step is quick, clean and complements the traditional ritual of enjoying wine.",
      "Due to its patented preservation system that creates an airtight seal over the wine, eto halts the oxidation process, which in turn preserves the wine\u2019s freshness and taste.",
      "As we become more health-consciousness, more and more of us are choosing to enjoy just a glass or two rather than several \u2013 or even save our wine drinking for the weekend. eto gives us this freedom.",
      "With eto you can open and savour that treasured bottle over a longer period.",

      "Beacon Laboratories. \u00a9 Bangor University 2016",
      "eto underwent rigorous testing and re-testing over a 12 month period with a variety of red and white wines. The results were indisputable - eto far out-performed competitor products in every tightly-monitored test.",
      "While science proved eto prevented oxidation, blind taste tests with wine experts showed that eto protected the quality of the wine too.",
      "'Master of Wine' Richard Hemming \u2013 and writer at JancisRobinson.com \u2013 took part in two separate blind taste tests, comparing freshly opened wine with its eto 7 day preserved equivalent.  \u201cOn the seventh day ... for me, the results were unanimous: there was no perceptible difference between a freshly opened bottle and the eto-stored sample\u201d Read the full article HERE.",
      "After taking part in a similar blind taste test, Wine Director at Honest Grapes, Tom Harrow, commented \u201cA wine which had been decanted (into eto) seven days beforehand tasted every bit as fresh as a wine which had come from a recently opened bottle. But it also had the added benefits of decanting, in that the wine was breathing ... it was opening up ... it tasted absolutely delicious.\u201d",
      "I am Tom Cotton, an award-winning industrial designer with nearly 20 years experience of bringing products from concept to market. I am passionate about protecting the environment, and in 2011 became interested in designing a product that helped to reduce wine wastage.",
      "Wine wastage is a huge environmental problem across the world. In the UK alone, 50 million litres of wine are poured down the sink every year - see WRAP report EVA063. A recent study by Laithwaite\u2019s Wine put the figure down as enough to fill 333 Olympic-sized swimming pools, and also these disturbing statistics:",
      "Our inability to preserve wine once the cork has been popped is a major cause of this wine waste. And I quickly discovered that the wine preservation products on the market were either ineffective or hugely expensive.",
      "My inspiration for eto came after a friend highlighted the method - common amongst wine experts - of transferring leftover wine into a smaller container to minimise the air contact. After experimenting, I found the method of reducing air exposure very effective. I just needed to work on the container\u2026",
      "After months of exploration I filed a patent for an innovative design in September 2012. At the core of the invention was a new unique valve concept that sealed wine at exactly the right moment, no matter how much wine was left.",
      "The \u2018design for manufacture\u2019 stage brought significant challenges. Not only did the valve require costly \u2018proof of concept\u2019 prototyping, experts in the glass industry said the precision required for glass simply couldn\u2019t be achieved within the cost.",
      "After a highly rigorous and competitive process, I was awarded an Innovate UK government grant to develop eto further. This support proved invaluable, allowing me to build over 60 functioning prototypes, develop a detailed manufacture design and test eto\u2019s effectiveness in the laboratory.",
      "Five years on, we have a product that really works. eto looks beautiful, preserves wine brilliantly and is exceptionally easy to use, store and maintain.",
      "We have built a strong relationship with our chosen manufacturing partner, and use only the highest quality materials to ensure eto is effective, elegant and durable in the long term.",
      "All materials are food approved and fully compliant with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the German BfR, ensuring they have no effect on the wine\u2019s flavour. All materials are also BPA free.",
      "eto dissembles into four main parts and these can be individually replaced if damaged. (Although we do not foresee any reason to replace parts due to natural wear & tear.)",
      "As glass specification was one of our major challenges, we undertook extensive research before selecting a glass manufacturer who we were confident could achieve the consistent glass tolerance required for eto without spiralling costs. High standards in worker treatment and environmental impact were also essential.",
      "We have worked closely with our manufacturing and assembly partner for over two years. They have over 30 years of experience bringing premium houseware products to market, and their skilled quality control team inspect each product before shipping.",
      "eto has taken several years to perfect, as we have built multiple prototypes to improve and simplify its design. We now have a product with minimal parts, precision-engineered seam-free glass, and high grade, anti-corrosion stainless steel that is both durable and aesthetic.",

      "Comfort Focused | Blocks Blue Light | Flexible Titanium Frame | Bubble Nose Pads | Silicone Arms",
      "Designed to help you focus, SUMS filter blue light, flex with three kinds of titanium to keep your vision centered, and at only 15 grams, feel weightless on your face.",
      "With 2 years of research on face anatomy and modern trends, we created SUMS in three distinct shapes that complement your unique face while still creating the most comfortable set of glasses ever.",
      "Frames made with unforgiving materials like plastic and acetate can break when you sit down or leave them unprotected. We use flexible titanium alloys in key parts of SUMS to prevent accidental breaks and maximize comfort.",
      "With weight concentrated on the lenses, glasses press down on the nose causing discomfort and dark marks after hours of wear.",
      "Steel frames can weigh 21 grams or more and fall down your face causing headaches and dizziness. SUMS uses three types of titanium for incredible durability, optimal weight distribution, and weighs 40% lighter than steel frames.",
      "Find the perfect balance for your prescription with two swappable temple tip options to keep SUMS centered on your face.",
      "We\u2019re under constant pressure from unnatural blue light from TVs, computers, phones.  Blue light ruins sleep patterns, causes headaches over time, and ruins our focus.",
      "Every pair of SUMS includes lenses that filter up to 30% of harmful blue light to reduce the strain from digital devices.",
      "All the sliding and rubbing on the skin causes redness and swelling. Sweat and body oils collect on the nose pads, and without proper cleaning, cause even more irritation.",
      "Hard plastic nose pads irritate the skin and leave dark marks after hours of wear. We created pillowy, air-filled nose pads with hypoallergenic silicone that not only keep the weight off your nose but also help keep your glasses from slipping!",
      "Glasses should have a fixed angle so they easily fit over the temples - but everyone has different head sizes. Unforgiving arms squeeze against the temples causing headaches and pain.",
      "Our patented C-Hinge is designed to flex outward to fit any face size or shape. The extra bend at the hinge prevents painful pressure against the temples and reduces marks from the arms.",
      "With the elasticity of the C-Hinges and nose bridge, you can tune your perfect fit for fewer headaches and take pressure off your temples.",
      "We\u2019ve spent the last 10 years trying eyewear from so many different brands looking to find the impossible right fit! Glasses simply haven\u2019t been designed with the wearer in mind. Until now, there hasn\u2019t been a perfect pair of comfortable lenses at an accessible price.",
      "In 2019, we set off with one goal in mind: \u201cDevelop the most comfortable eyewear in the world!\u201d Since then, SUMS strives to provide the comfiest glasses possible and make them accessible to anyone.",
      "Whether you\u2019re working all day in front of a computer screen, going outdoors on a hike, or having a date night after work - your glasses should be primed for any occasion. Choose from a variety of lens options at the end of our campaign. Our polycarbonate lenses are:",
      "Our eyes are under constant pressure from blue light (sometimes referred to as HEV or High-Energy Light) emitted from digital screens. Long-term exposure to blue light can hurt your retinas and cause headaches, keep you up at night, and impact your mental health.",
      "Unlike many blue light options with a gaudy yellow-tinge, SUMS lenses are completely clear. The image above simulates the blue light filters that are invisible to the human eye.",
      "We use the latest Transitions\u2122 Gen-8 technology (the first brand to ever make photochromatic lenses):",
      "The chemical applied to these lenses is invisible to the naked eye.",
      "Our polarized lenses not only block up to 100% of UV light but also contain a special chemical to help filter light that approaches your eye.",
      "Polarized lenses protect your eyes from harmful reflections from horizontal light waves from a smooth pond or shiny car hood. You\u2019ll see a darker image with crisper and clearer details where even tiny features are easier to see.",
      "We spent two years designing the three final shapes SUMS come in to ensure SUMS compliments any size and shape of the face.",
      "To create the stunning finishes SUMS come in, we anodize the titanium alloys and ensure the temple tips (silicone or acetate), nose pads (silicone or acrylic) are in the proper hues.",
      "We remove all the intermediaries and offer premium glasses, cheaper than typical store prices.",
      "Backers will receive our ready-to-wear, non-prescription blue light filtering lenses.",
      "After our campaign is over, each of our backers will receive a Backer Survey. We\u2019ll also include a full tutorial on how to fill in the survey beforehand to avoid common errors that might lead to delaying your order. In the survey you will be able to select:",
      "We first created renders to understand how each piece of SUMS would come together.",
      "We used a 3D Printer to test the shapes and see if the shape fit comfortably and worked with lenses.",
      "Our first prototypes made with our factory let us see color options and feel just how light SUMS truly are! This also helps us identify optimizations we need to make before beginning production.",
      "Over the past 10 years, we\u2019ve tried eyewear from so many different brands, including the classic look of Ray-ban, Oliver People\u2019s vintage aesthetic, Luxury brands like DITA, and disruptors like Warby Parker, finding it impossible to find the right fit! Not a single brand was able to provide glasses designed for the end-user: the perfect pair of comfortable lenses at an accessible price.",
      "In 2019, we set off with one goal in mind: \u201cDevelop the most comfortable eyewear in the world!\u201d Since then, SUMS strives to provide the comfiest glasses possible, as we dedicate ourselves to make them accessible to anyone.",

Gurri Kahlon has designed a variety of unique garments for celebrities, politicians and royalty on a global scale.",
      "Typically, the average cost of a Gurri Kahlon designer garment is priced in the thousands but Gurri wants to desgin for the many, not just the few; it is now his goal to design garments without compromising on his vision of elaborate runway fashion and make them affordable for the modern gentleman.",
      "Although, your suit will be completely customisable; these two cuts are the most popular and never go out of style so you can feel confident wearing your suit to the office, a formal event or an evening cocktail with friends.",
      "THE MODERNO DESIGN:\nThe Moderno Design is inspired by the Colonial English era. The wide peak lapels and tapered cut make this design a truly unique and modern hi-fashion power suit.",
      "THE CLASSICO DESIGN:\nThe Classico design is inspired by the traditional Italian Power Suit.  The risen notch lapel and a tapered cut give this design a unique appeal.",

      "We use only natural and eco-friendly fabric.  The production of luxury items is known to leave a heavy footprint on our planet; our fabric is a blend of low emissions production fabric comprised of Virgin Wool, Cashmere, Tencil and Lycra for ultra comfort and flexibility.",
      "The Billionaire Articles Fabric is a luxury fabric which is made from 100% virgin Australian lamb\u2019s wool with a quality standard of 17 microns.  Due to unique weaving technology and micron count, the wool fabric stays cool during summer and keeps you warm in the winter.",

At this point, you will Schedule your 'Sizing call'.\n\nStep 2: \nGurri will get you sized for your suit via your one on one, sizing call.  He will advise you on the right suit color and cut according to your build and complexion.\n\nStep 3: \nWhen you receive your suit, you will now have a one on one, 'Fitting Call' with Gurri Kahlon where he will analyse the fit and suggest any necessary alterations .",
      "Above is an image captured during an actual 'Fitting' call between a Backer/Client and Gurri Kahlon (Thanks Paul!).",
      "You will get personalised attention from Gurri Kahlon.",
      "After your order, we will schedule your sizing call with Gurri Kahlon, where he will get your measurements and discuss the right suit and cut based on your physique and complexion.",
      "Luxury suits of this caliber are never mass produced.  A Billionaire suit should be exclusive not only in its fabric and design but also in its scarce nature, therefore, to maintain exclusivity, we will literally, put your name on your suit.",
      "Your suit's label will not be done by machine.  Instead, your name will be hand embroidered by an eighty year old artisan who has mastered this craft over the past 60 years.",
      "Bespoke, Artisan construction, is the epitome of a Billionaire Suit and we have mastered this art.",
      "A great amount of attention towards detail is absorbed by each and every suit.  Each suit is carefully handcrafted by skilled, Italian Artisans who have been making luxury suits for decades as their primary profession.",
      "You can count every stitch on your lapel and feel how well the suit will mould to your body as if it were chiseled to perfection.  It is only fair to say that these Artisans pour their heart and soul into their workmanship and exercise their craft purely out of passion.",
      "In the good old days, suits were made using horse canvas in the interlining of the jacket; the purpose behind this practice is, that the natural elasticity of horse hair, allows the jacket to slowly mould to your body, it accentuates your masculinity while creating a perfect fit as you wear it.  and the best part is: this a completely harmless process, the hair is collected simply from the routine brushings of the horse.",
      "This process is quite tedious and labor intense and as you can imagine, it is not a common practice in current times. You'll be glad to know that each of these limited 1500 suits will be constructed using horsehair canvas and will last for a lifetime.",
      "We teamed up with a fourth generation tailoring facility. This family of tailors and their ancestors have been producing artisan, bespoke suits since the late 18th Century.",

      "Luxury brands markup their costs by a minimum of 600% due to middlemen and overhead expenses.  We made it our mission to get past all of it and figured out a way to offer these suits to you at a fair and affordable price.",
      "By reaching out directly to the fine mills of fashion powerhouses and teaming up directly with a lineage tailoring house, we were able to source the fabric and stitch the suits for a very impressive price.",
      "We embarked on a journey and faced many challenges to bring our vision of the Billionaire suit to life.  Our Mission was to make a luxury, designer suit affordable for the modern man.  Today, we are proud to announce that For the First Time Ever, a designer collection of Billionaire quality fabric suits, with original tags, is offered - Without the Luxury Markup.",
      "In our journey, We faced many challenges created by upset middlemen and even from pioneers within the fashion industry who tried relentlessly to stop us from gaining any kind of traction. But every-time they tried to knock us down, we got back up.  In the end, after months of hard work and dedication, we succeeded in what may be one of the first steps towards reforming the designer fashion industry forever...",

      "We've taken steps to ensure our Indiegogo campaign is a success and that we successfully deliver the suits to our backers.",
      "1) We started first with the two most important elements: Fabric and the Tailors. We successfully secured contracts with companies that we source from. In fact, we flew to Turkey, Italy, and India to meet them in person to plan our entire process and we are on track for our delivery date.",
      "2) We created our Indiegogo budget so that...\na) it covers all our marketing, production, shipping and travel expenses\nb) leaves us enough funds in profit to help grow our company into new product lines.",
      "We are not looking to get rich from this campaign. We want your support to help us build our brand.",
      "3) Some asked us how we got our prices so low, they seem too low. That's simple. Our fabric Manufacturers and our Tailors know this is an Indiegogo campaign and arranged lower prices to support us. This is only helpful for them in the long terms as we will send all future orders to them. They help us now and they see more business from us in the future.",
      "4) Some of our backers asked about sizing concerns. Gurri or his design team will be available on video chat to help you through the process (free).",
      "Our suits are sold on Indiegogo at very low-profit margins. As you can know this suit sells in stores for over $3600 and you are buying it at $499 (75% off when you buy three or more). That being the case, if by any chance you need minor alternations, you may incur some costs from your local tailor (typically $20-60). We won't be able to refund this costs, as you are saving over $3000 on this suit. Lastly, since each suit is custom made, we do not offer any refunds or returns. We will do our best to make sure the suit looks great on you- thats why we are willing to get on video calls with you and help you measure- no matter where you are in the world!",

      "Because having an uninterrupted sleep at night shouldn't be that hard.\n\nYou've tested every type of bedding material out there. Even gone as far as to cover yourself with extra blankets to keep the cold away or decided to sleep without one so that you won't wake up feeling like a boiled egg.\n\nBut no matter what you do, you can't seem to get a good night's sleep.\n\nThis is HILU \u2014 your ultimate blanket for all seasons made from pure graphene fiber.\n\nIt's time to say goodbye to restless nights and sweaty mornings because HILU has got you covered, literally.",
      "Most traditional blankets trap heat, making hot sleepers like you even hotter (not in a good way, tho ;) ). And because they don't insulate well, cold sleepers can end up feeling chilly.",
      "HILU is the world's first graphene-made blanket that adjusts to your body temperature so you can sleep all night comfortably \u2013whatever the season.\n\nIt\u2019s the perfect addition to any bedding set. Lightweight and highly durable, with unmatched warming and cooling properties.",
      "If you've ever wished you could somehow harness the power of microchips to help you get a good night's sleep, your wish can be a reality.\n\nThe HILU blanket is made from pure graphene fiber with Adaptex Technology that reacts naturally to your body's temperature, keeping you comfortable all night.",
      "But how is this miracle fabric made? The process is called \"Wet Spinning\", and it's very similar to making Kevlar, the bullet-proof material. This process creates a stronger fabric than steel, yet it's still light, soft and comfortable on the skin.",
      "So whether you're a light sleeper who tosses and turns all night, or someone who gets hot flashes in the middle of the night, the HILU blanket is here to help you get a good night's rest. Sweet dreams!",
      "You asked: is graphene safe?\n\nGraphene oxide in its raw form (in powder) may not be safe. However, processed single-layer graphene, such as that in our graphene fibers, is totally safe and it is certified by the IGCC and the OEKO-TEX100.\n\nThis means Hilu blankets are safe for both babies and adults.",
      "There's nothing worse than feeling like you're being hugged by an oven (or a fridge \u2013we don't judge). With HILU, you'll never have to worry about that again.\n\nImagine a blanket that reacts to the touch of your skin; that\u2019s the Adaptex Fabric Technology in every HILU.\n\nWhat does this mean?",
      "Pretty cool, isn\u2019t it? Or should we say hot?",
      "Whether it's hot outside or you're just overdressed (in bed, yes, that happens to the best of us); you might wake up drenched in your own sweat. You won't have to worry about that with HILU.\n\nHILU absorbs the heat from your body and dissipates the heat within the fiber, preventing the build-up of humidity, and keeping you dry all night long.",
      "This blanket made of pure graphene fiber is not only incredibly soft and comfortable, but it's also anti-microbial and anti-bacterial.\n\nYou won't have to worry about getting sick from germs on your blanket because it stays fresh and clean for longer.",
      "HILU blankets are made from a gentle, soft fabric that doesn't irritate your skin despite the power-packed graphene technology.\n\nConsider it like the sandman\u2019s magic inspiring beautiful dreams and putting you to sleep softly every single time.",
      "When HILU was developed, we determine to bring a new standard in the sleep industry. We are the best in the business and we are so confident with the superior craftsmanship that we are backing it up with a TEN (10) YEAR WARRANTY.\n\nThat's right, a whole ten years! We want you to have peace of mind knowing that HILU will be there with you for the long haul.",
      "No matter how cold or short the days grow, you don't have to give up your wanderlust. With a temperature-regulating blanket, you can stay cozy and warm wherever you go.\n\nTake HILU with you on all your adventures, from camping in the mountains to stargazing on a cold winter night. HILU is the perfect companion for any outdoor activity.",
      "Made to make your sleep better, snuggles cozier and life easier, HILU is also super simple to care for. If your HILU gets a little dirty, just machine wash on gentle with cold water and tumble dry low or line dry. That\u2019s it!\n\nYour HILU will stay as soft, cozy, and cuddly as the day you got. Even after 10 years of usage and many washings.",
      "Video of testimonials",
      "Each one of us in our team tried different ways to look forward to a good night's rest, but somehow nothing has worked.. We figured to get together to make a ridiculously awesome blanket that will solve the billion-dollar problem\u2014how can we all get the best sleep of our lives every night..",
      "We combined all our extensive experience* that combined science, design, and engineering to make a revolutionary smooth and silky fabric with natural temperature regulating properties. A material that regulates our body temperature through the night so we get the perfect night sleep.",
      "With the silky feel and super durability to match, HILU was born. It really should cost an arm and a leg, but the team really just wanted to have good sleep so they figured to make it as affordable as possible to share HILU with everyone.",
      "* FYI it's really the experience and work of Scott, Gilad, and James\u2026ssshhh but Ricardo and laura did made sure to put the word out to tell everyone about HILU.",

      "With just one click, the plastic sheet pops up, and you can bid farewell to all that hair once and for all.",
      "It's important to choose a comb with the right tooth density for your pets. If it's too dense, it will pull on their hair and cause discomfort. If it's too sparse, it won't effectively remove excess hair.",
      "After numerous tests and comparisons, we've determined that a 1 mm tooth density is the most suitable for pets.",
      "Other type of comb deforms easily.",

      "Bite Into Comfort: The Pierogi Bucket - Ohio City's New Comfort Food Favorite",
      "My name is Miroslav, and I've worked in the service industry for over 20 years - from hotels like Marriott and Hilton to both fast food and upscale restaurants. For the past two and a half years I've been with Perla Pierogies, where I created and developed the Pierogi Bucket concept. Originally from Eastern Europe, I've always been passionate about culinary traditions and sharing comforting, authentic flavors in new and acceptable ways.",
      "This campaign is important to me because The Pierogi Bucket is a way to share a food tradition I love in a playful, modern format. It's more than just a food project - it's a reflection of my background and a chance to grow something meaningful from the ground up.",
      "The Pierogi Bucket is a fresh, fast, and fun take on comfort food - served in a bucket and packed with flavor. With your support, we can launch as a ghost kitchen or pop-up in Ohio City, build awareness, and lay the groundwork for a permanent location. Your contribution will help turn a proven idea into a local favorite.",
      "We're seeking $30,000 to cover early startup costs of launching The Pierogi Bucket in Ohio City. This includes: renting space in commercial kitchen or partnering with a restaurant for pop-up hours, food prep, supplies, packaging, marketing, and basic equipment.",
      "Perks for backers: a custom Pierogi Bucket sticker to say thank you, voucher (s) redeemable for food once we launch, a signed copy of my \"PIEROGI!\" book at select contribution levels.",
      "Even if we don't reach the full goal, partial funding will still help us bring The Pierogi Bucket to Ohio City through pop-ups. This concept is already being served and loved at Perla Pierogies in Parma - now it's time to introduce it to a wider audience and prepare for a dedicated location in Ohio City.",
      "This isn't just another takeout concept - it's a way to bring regional comfort food to more people in a fun, convenient format. At the heart of The Pierogi Bucket is a simple idea: fried Perla Minis, served in a playful bucket with kielbasa. It's fast, satisfying, and easy to enjoy. Handmade pierogi and select sides will be available, but the core of the concept is the bucket - familiar, sharable, and built for simplicity.",
      "What makes this campaign different is that The Pierogi Bucket isn't just an idea - it already has a proven track record. We've been running a small version of the concept at Perla Pierogies in Parma, where it well received by customers and performs especially well on delivery platforms.",
      "By supporting this campaign, you're not just backing a concept - you're helping bring a working, well-received food idea into a new neighborhood where it can grow. That makes a real difference, and you'll be part of the story form the beginning",
      "Like any new venture, there are uncertainties - such as finding the right kitchen partner, balancing early production costs, and getting the word our in a new neighborhood. But I've spent over two decades in the service industry and two and a half years with Perla Pierogies, where I developed and refined this concept. I understand how to run lean, stay flexible, and deliver consistently good food.",
      "Our plan is to start with low-overhead pop-ups in available restaurant kitchens - this gives a chance to build interest, adjust based on feedback, and grow organically. We're not rushing into a permanent lease until we know we're ready.",
      "Even if you can't contribute financially, you can still support us by: sharing this campaign with friends and local food fans, following us on social media and help build awareness, using Indiegogo's share tools to spread the word and encourage others to join in. Every bit of support helps us get closer to making The Pierogi Bucket a reality in Ohio City!",

      "The RIMIT Kit allows you to rim up your favourite cocktails anywhere, anytime in seconds!",
      "We want to thank you so much for taking the time to check out our kickstarter.",
      "My name is Rob Cox , I am the Founder and President of RIMIT. People ask me all the time, \"How did you come up with this idea?\" The honest truth is, one day in August 2018, I woke up at 3am and the exact vision of what RIMIT is today was in my head. My guess would be after years of suffering from drinking Caesars from a can without rimmer, the universe worked its magic and gave me the solution to my problem.",
      "Although my background had been in the Landscaping industry for the previous 15 years, I had always been an entrepreneur, owning  businesses in different categories such as a Real estate Investing in Canada and Nicaragua, Granite Counter Tops and few others so I knew extensive research was needed to determine if we should pursue the idea of RIMIT. We quickly realized there may just be a high demand for RIMIT. The problem that we solved with RIIMIT wasn\u2019t just so that consumers could now add rimmer to there canned cocktails but they could now enjoy a fully rimmed cocktails anywhere, anytime in just seconds. And they can do this without their lips having to come in contact with germ covered cans.",
      "But RIMIT was just the beginning. We quickly discovered that there was another problem that we needed to solve. In order to be able to enjoy a fully rimmed cocktail anywhere, anytime in just seconds, the lime juice and rimmer needs to be readily available. It just takes too much time and makes too much mess to have to get out the bowls, rimmer, lime juice and pour them into the bowls just to rim up a couple of cocktails. Then once your done, you now have rimmer and lime juice that both go to waste and you have dishes to do.",
      "The Solution was The RIMIT Kit. Our patent pending 2 in 1 compact, leak-proof rimmer kit allows you to rim up your cocktails anywhere, anytime in just seconds.",
      "The idea of The RIMIT Kit was born just a couple months after RIMIT but The RIMIT Kit needed about 18 months of R&D to get it just perfect. The original thought of The RIMIT Kit would be a small compact 2 in 1 rimmer kit that could fit in your pocket and would only be compatible with the RIMIT. After 18 months of R&D, it was clear that we had to make it just big enough to be compatible with any standard household drinking glass and of course, RIMIT. But it still had to be compact, leak-proof and easily transportable. Not like the standard bar top rimmer trays. So we ended up with this!",
      "Our patent and Trade Mark pending products both RIMIT and The RIMIT Kit were invented to provide more convenience and a quicker solution for preparing fully rimmed cocktails anywhere, anytime in just seconds. All of our products are Made with FDA approved polypropylene, they are BPA Free, Dish Washer Friendly, Recyclable but more importantly they are Reusable. We encourage our customers to wash and reuse our products to minimize waste.",
      "The RIMIT Kit comes with 130 Grams of co-branded Lucky\u2019s Rim Job Rimmer. All you have to do is add 1 ounce of lime juice to the lime juice compartment. The RIMIT Kit can be easily transported via cooler bags, back packs, purses ect. It loves to be stored in the fridge to keep the lime juice fresh.",
      "In todays busy world, there never seems to be enough time in a day. To us, it makes more sense to spend less time preparing cocktails and creating dishes and spend more time enjoying your favorite cocktails with friends and family.",
      "So whether your looking to enjoy a Caesar, Michelada, Margarita, Bloody Mary at home, at the cottage, the beach, camping, golfing or backyard get togethers, RIMIT and The RIMIT Kit allows you to conveniently enjoy fully rimmed cocktails in just seconds.",
      "We officially launched RIMIT in August 2019 and sales plus co-branded partnerships have taken off for us including a collaboration with Mott\u2019s Clamato Caesar\u2019s. Now it is time to introduce The RIMIT Kit. We have already selected our Manufacturer and our moulds are currently being fabricated. We are on schedule to be in full production by the middle of August this year and now we need your help to get our first manufacturing run off the ground so please back this campaign so we can launch The RIMIT Kit and Elevate your cocktail experience.",

      "In an age that prioritizes speed and efficiency, every detail counts. Cycling enthusiasts know that a properly inflated tire is not only a safeguard for safe travel but also the cornerstone of an enjoyable ride. However, the bulk and inefficiency of traditional air pumps often pose inconveniences on the journey. Today, we introduce a super mini air pump that disrupts tradition and leads the trend. With its compact size and efficient performance, it redefines the standard for portable inflation tools.",
      "Although designed for bicycles, the super mini air pump's applications extend far beyond. Whether inflating sports equipment like basketballs and soccer balls or providing quick inflation solutions for children's toy cars and swim rings, it can handle it all. Its compact size and powerful functionality make it an ideal companion for outdoor adventures, family gatherings, sports training, and various other scenarios.",
      "In this interconnected world, the TYPE-C interface, with its wide compatibility and rapid charging speed, has become the standard for numerous electronic devices. Our super mini air pump follows suit, adopting a TYPE-C charging port. Whether it's a phone charger, power bank, or car charger, you can easily power it up. This means, wherever you are, just a common TYPE-C cable will allow you to recharge your air pump, completely eliminating the hassle of finding a specific charger.",
      "For bicycle tires, the right air pressure is crucial for riding stability and comfort. Our super mini air pump, powered by a high-efficiency motor, quickly reaches a working pressure of 150PSI (about 10.3 bar), far exceeding the range required by ordinary bicycle tires, making it easy to handle even the high-pressure demands of mountain bikes or road bikes. More impressive is that it takes only 50 seconds to inflate a tire from empty to full, making every pre-trip preparation incredibly simple and quick.",
      "While pursuing high-performance, we also focus on the pump's durability and portability. Therefore, this super mini air pump uses high-quality aluminum alloy for its shell. Aluminum alloy not only offers excellent corrosion resistance, effectively resisting wear and tear from daily use and moist environments, but its lightweight nature keeps the entire air pump at just 300 grams, equivalent to the weight of a smartphone, easily fitting into backpacks or cycling bags without adding any burden.",
      "Besides rapid inflation, airflow stability is also a critical indicator of an air pump's quality. Our super mini air pump achieves a powerful airflow output of 15 liters per minute through precise airway design and optimized motor drive systems. This means, even when quickly adding a significant amount of air, it maintains a stable airflow, ensuring every inflation is uniform and efficient, avoiding excessive wear or damage to the tire.",
      "Battery life is a key factor in measuring the practicality of portable devices. The super mini air pump is equipped with a high-performance 10000mAh lithium-ion battery, capable of supporting multiple consecutive inflation operations. Even during outdoor rides lasting several hours, it ensures you have enough power for unexpected needs. What's more reassuring is that the battery supports fast charging, quickly restoring full power, so you can travel without worries.",
      "Beyond its powerful functionality and durability, we have also put considerable effort into detail design. The pump surface features anti-slip treatment, providing a firm grip even in wet conditions. An integrated storage design keeps accessories like valve adapters organized and within reach, preventing loss and clutter. These thoughtful, user-friendly designs make every use a pleasant experience.",
      "Although designed for bicycles, the super mini air pump's applications extend far beyond. Whether inflating sports equipment like basketballs and soccer balls or providing quick inflation solutions for children's toy cars and swim rings, it can handle it all. Its compact size and powerful functionality make it an ideal companion for outdoor adventures, family gatherings, sports training, and various other scenarios.",
      "In this fast-paced world, every second counts. The super mini air pump, with its unbelievable convenience, efficiency, and durability, redefines the inflation tool experience. It's not just a product; it's a symbol of the pursuit of quality life. Whether you're a freedom-loving cyclist, an outdoor adventurer, or a family user frequently inflating various items, this super mini air pump will be your indispensable companion. Let's use the power of technology to open a new chapter in convenient inflation!",

      "Hey there, adventurers of creativity and precision!",
      "I'm excited to introduce you to the Prule \u2013 a truly revolutionary titanium folding ruler that brings together practicality, adaptability, and functionality in a way you've never seen before. It's not just a ruler; it's a game-changer.",
      "Made from Gr5 titanium, Prule is a tough little ruler that's built to last. It folds up magnetically, making it super easy to carry around with you. Despite its compact size, Prule is incredibly strong and durable, making it perfect for a wide range of tasks. Also, the Prule has made significant improvements in its ergonomic design.",
      "But here's the real kicker: a built-in protractor for measuring angles and a tiny craft knife for quick cuts or trimming. Of course, the Prule packed with more features that make it even more versatile. Whether you're working on a DIY project, doing some crafting, or just need a reliable ruler for everyday tasks, the Prule has everything you need in one sleek, ergonomic design.",
      "So why settle for an ordinary ruler when you can have the Prule? It's the perfect addition to your toolkit, ready to tackle any task you throw at it. It's tailor-made for DIY enthusiasts, crafters, students, architects, engineers, and for anyone who values accuracy and comfort.",
      "The Prule is crafted with a 25\u00b0 angled surface that naturally aligns with your line of sight. This means you can read the measurements without straining your neck or back, making reading measurements a joy, not a chore.",
      "Comfort to read",
      "With its unique thickened design, the Prule is not only easier to grip, but also ensures safer cutting by keeping hands away from the path of the blade, providing a more stable and safe measurement state.",
      "easy to grab",
      "safe to cut",
      "Alright, let's talk about the material now. The Prule is made from Gr5 titanium, which is super strong and lightweight, perfect for high-performance tasks. Its incredible strength ensures it won't break easily, giving you peace of mind. Despite being tough, it's so light you'll barely feel it in your pocket, and it looks awesome too. The titanium body makes it durable and versatile, performing flawlessly in any environment. Built to last, the Prule withstands the toughest conditions without compromising performance, making it your perfect go-to tool.",
      "Imagine a ruler where every mark is as crisp as a freshly pressed button. Our laser-etched scales provide unparalleled clarity, ensuring you never miss a millimeter or a sixteenth of an inch. Whether you\u2019re working in imperial or metric, the scales are meticulously engraved to provide accurate and easy-to-read measurements.",
      "Tired of guesswork when measuring from a non-zero starting point? Our ruler starts its scales at zero, providing an intuitive and straightforward measuring experience. No more subtracting or estimating \u2013 just clear, accurate measurements every time.",
      "Meet the ruler that adapts to your needs. Its design allows for both deep and shallow measurements, making it perfect for a wide range of tasks. Whether you're measuring the depth of a wide, deep container or the narrow confines of a tiny bottle, this ruler is your versatile, reliable companion.",
      "The Prule cleverly turns its folding design into a super-versatile protractor that both pros and hobbyists will love. We've really put some thought into the ruler's hinge, making it double as a protractor that smoothly opens up to 180 degrees. With this innovative design, you can measure any angle in a breeze, just by using the ruler's natural motion.",
      "Inside this range, we've thoughtfully added six different detent spots, each marked every 30 degrees. These spots give you a nice clicky feeling when you hit them, helping you set common angles quickly and accurately. Whether you're sketching cool designs, planning out buildings, or doing detailed engineering work, the Prule is incredibly handy. You can easily lock into the angle you need, making your measurements and drawings both precise and quick.",
      "But The Prule doesn't just measure \u2013 it cuts too! Our ruler is equipped with a hidden blade that's perfect for a wide range of cutting tasks.",
      "Attach a rope or lanyard to the convenient hole, making it easy to keep The Prule with you wherever you go.",
      "A ceramic bead breaker is included for emergencies, and the tritium slot allows you to insert a tritium or glow tube, making Prule glow in the dark for easy location. In emergency situations, the ceramic bead can be used to break windows, providing a vital escape route.",
      "Equipped with 2 tritium slots on each side, you can insert 1.5*6mm tritium tubes or glow-in-the-dark tubes for easy location in dim environments. This feature ensures that The Prule is always within reach when you need it most.",
      "To express our heartfelt gratitude to our esteemed early backers, we are delighted to introduce exclusive reward tiers exclusively for you. Each reward package includes an Prule Ruler, 10 replacement blades, and complimentary worldwide shipping, ensuring no additional charges beyond your pledged amount. If you find our add-on options appealing, you have the option to select them through our supplementary offerings.",
      "The sooner you decide to back our project, the more generous the discount you will receive. Therefore, we highly encourage you to pledge at your earliest convenience to secure the most favorable pricing!",
      "If you\u2019re looking to further personalize your Prule, explore our add-on options, which include items like a carrying pouch, titanium lanyard bead, replacement blades, tritium vials, glass luminous vials, or engraving services. This flexibility allows you to customize your reward to fit your style and preferences.",
      "P.S.: Tritium vials provide a continuous glow without needing a charge, while glass luminous vials require exposure to light to illuminate.",
      "The journey of the Prule, from initial concept to prototype, and now to a final product, has taken us over half a year of hard work and dedication. If the product is well-received and supported by everyone, it will take a few more months from production to shipping before it reaches your hands. We are aiming to start shipping by the end of March, and while we will do our best to deliver earlier without compromising on quality, we will also keep you updated throughout the entire process.",
      "Of course, the design process of The Prule was not without its challenges. Initially, our goal was simple: to create a folding ruler. But how could we make it more innovative and unique? We pondered over this question and came up with an idea \u2013 using the folding mechanism to create a simple yet precise protractor. By simply adding scales and gears to the ruler, when the concept became true, we thought, \"Bang, it worked!\"",
      "Here is the initial sketch of the Prule:",
      "With a clear vision in mind, we moved into the design phase. We sketched numerous concepts, refined them through CAD modeling, and focused on integrating the folding mechanism with the protractor function. Titanium alloy was chosen for its lightweight strength and corrosion resistance, ensuring that the ruler could withstand the rigors of professional use while maintaining a sleek and elegant appearance.",
      "With the help of 3D printing technology, we created multiple prototypes for physical testing and functional verification. User feedback was invaluable, guiding us to make further improvements. We iterated on the design, optimizing ergonomics, aesthetics, and the overall user experience.",
      "3D printing",
      "3D printed product",
      "Eventually, after numerous rounds of testing and refinement, we successfully crafted a final prototype that embodied our vision. The Prule Titanium Multi-Functional Folding Ruler not only folded for easy storage but also featured a precision protractor with scales and gears, making it a versatile tool for professionals across various fields.",
      "Prototype",
      "Prule is a multifaceted tool designed to revolutionize your measuring, cutting, and problem-solving abilities, serving as your trusted sidekick in life's challenges. Join us in supporting this vision, and together we can bring Prule to life, transforming the world of measuring with this precision tool that's truly a cut above the rest.

      "Runners care a lot about product performance.  In the making of FITLY, we logged hundreds of miles, challenging every inch of every component.  We are proud to say that FITLY has the most cutting-edge components available today.",
      "FITLY is a World's First with its totally awesome patent pending Thoracic Belt System: two subpectoral front pockets attached to a stretch belt that retracts slightly so all items are kept in place when you run and are naturally accessible without affecting your running form.",
      "We are sometimes asked whether FITLY is designed for man and woman.  The upper straps are adjustable.  You can see in the animation below that this particular runner wears FITLY fairly high.  She could have lowered the thoracic belt at least 4 inches/ 10 cm, making it totally fine for both man and woman and even below your cardio.",
      "Picture yourself running. Your hands naturally swing by your thorax making it very convenient to store and retrieve small personal items in the two subpectoral pockets without any impact on your running form. No need to stop or modify your gait to securely store a car key your friend just handed to you or to retrieve a gel.",
      "The Thoracic Belt has a gentle stretch (retraction force) which locks all items in place. Nothing moves. No bouncing is possible and the retraction force is calculated to be soft enough to not affect breathing.",
      "This Patent Pending invention is incredibly useful during vigorous activities, especially runners who want to safely carry a few personal items.",
      "The right pocket has three mini-slots to put away loose coins, a key, lip balm stick, or maybe a beautiful shell you pick up during your morning run so they do not rattle during your peaceful run!",
      "The Fidlock system combines two fastening concepts in one: a magnetic snap and a mechanical lock that clips tightly around 1 of 3 positions, offering useful adjustments while on the run.",
      "Cell phones are important for security, communication, music, orientation and training logs (apps).  They're so essential, we see people running with them in their hands daily. When asked if they'd prefer to stick it in FITLY and the reaction is always the same.",
      "Cell phones are expensive, what if it rains?   You need to protect it!",
      "FITLY's Phone Slot is exactly designed to host your cell phone with two significant advantages over almost any other solution:",
      "With today's headphone button, voice control, and smartwatches, hundreds of phone commands are readily available without the need to stop and access your phone:  Play Music, Skip, Answer/hang up, Call home, Play Radio, Hear messages, etc. Your phone is tucked away, entirely protected from the weather yet perfectly available.",
      "Constructed using high tenacity military-grade fiber technologies, the CORDURA\u00ae fabric is exceptionally durable and puncture resistant.",
      "Our prototypes have been used hundreds of time, under heavy rain, and gallons of sweat with no sign of deterioration.  The fabric is \"best in class\", used in high-end mountain guide equipment, made to endure the toughest weather.",
      "FITLY IS MADE TO LAST!",
      "S.Caf\u00e9\u00ae is an eco-friendly (Cradle to Cradle certified) soft fabric that combines nylon yarns and recycled ground coffee at the cellular level.

      "Front and back safety reflective bands as well as silver reflective logos for your night adventures. See and be seen!",
      "Also available is a 2-inch long webbing to attach an additional light.  It is especially important for bikers on an early morning ride.",
      "Trivial but important, we placed a mini whistle directly in the front pocket so it can be immediately accessed.",
      "FITLY is a running accessory made for quick runs. The majority of people (85%) we surveyed run with 2 or more items, the most frequent are Cell Phones and keys (car, house, hotel).",
      "Of the 15% remaining, half would prefer having their cell phone for security and communication in the case of an incident but had not found a suitable way to carry it.",
      "For longer runs, where hydration and heavier gear affects performance, lots of options already exist.  Hydration is important but less of a focus in short runs (sub 45 min).  You can carry 130 ml/4.4 oz jugs or flasks in one of the front pockets and about 3X as much in the secret pocket.",
      "...you can do less!",
      "Light and thin FITLY is also a clever solution to carry small personal items for travel, day trips, and less vigorous activities, such as kayaking, walking, hiking or just a visit to the museum or a city event. For travel, stick your passport or wallet in the \u201csecret\u201d side pocket for added protection. Wear your FITLY under your jacket for complete security.",
      "Three different color accents and 2 sizes.",
      "FITLY covers sizes from 26 In/67 cm to 40 In/102 cm (under breast measurement), which spans from XS to XL.  Once you have pledged, we will reach out to you for your color and size selections.",

      "Some were goosebumps worthy:",
      "\u201cI love FITLY! I\u2019ve tried multiple running belts and bags and they all ride up or move once I get going. And the material never seems to keep my phone safe from moisture. FITLY stayed snug, fit comfortably, and it kept my phone dry!\u201d",

As our customer service patiently helped them find the reason, the customer suddenly found that the plug was not fully inserted. This is a simple problem that many competitors overlook. To prevent our users from facing this situation, we added the connection detection system on the M1 display screen. It can help you check the connection status of PC, PHONE, INSTRUMENT and CHARGE. If they are connected, you will see their icons on the top line of LED screen. If you cannot see the icon, that indicates your device is poorly connected or not connected at all.",

      "All New INVISIBILITY SHIELDS. Lightweight. Portable. Next Level Cloaking. Pack Down Small.",
      "We've spent the past four years developing and testing optical cloaking devices. We're now seeking your support to share our new and improved, second generation invisibility shields with the world!",
      "The front face of our new Full Size shield is 17% bigger than the previous version and the Megashield is three times bigger than that, measuring 6ft (1.8m) tall, making it large enough to hide multiple people standing side by side.",
      "Our new shields have been completely redesigned to be more stable when left free-standing, easy to hold and easy to take wherever you want to go.",
      "New ergonomic handles make holding and carrying the shield far more comfortable, whilst keeping your body in the optimum position to stay hidden.",
      "Our shields won't take up valuable space when you're not using them. The Full Size shields and Megashields can be completely disassembled and packed in dedicated carry cases (available to add on at checkout).",
      "Full Size shields and Megashields are constructed from a high grade polycarbonate offering improved strength and durability.",
      "Instead of using adhesives to bond layers of material, the main body of each shield is extruded from a single piece of material. This allows more light to pass through, creating a brighter, clearer and more vibrant rendering of the background. This also completely prevents adhesive related artefacts, like air bubbles and streaks, making our new shields look great at any distance.",
      "Our Full Size shield takes the average novice 10 minutes to set up and pack for the first time and the Megashield takes around 15 minutes (with two people). We recommend setting up and handling the Megashield with two people on account of its size. Instructions are included to assist with the first assembly.",
      "No power source is required, simply assemble your invisibility shield and place it in front of whoever or whatever you wish to cloak.",
      "Don't see a shipping rate estimate for your specific selection of rewards?",
      "To calculate your estimate, add the estimates for each tier included in your selection.",
      "Doing a final shipping calculation closer to the time of delivery allows us to find the minimum cost for you, in your specific location based on shipping prices at the time. Expected charges can go up or down.",
      "Each shield uses a precision engineered lens array to direct light reflected from the subject standing behind it, away from the observer standing in front. The lenses in this array are oriented so that the vertical strip of light reflected by the standing/crouching subject becomes diffuse when spread out horizontally on passing through the back of the shield. In contrast, the strip of light reflected from the background is much wider, so when it passes through the back of the shield, far more of it is refracted both across the shield and towards the observer. From the observer's perspective, this background light is effectively smeared horizontally across the front face of the shield, over the area where the subject would ordinarily be seen.",
      "The optical arrays we use to construct our shields are manufactured by extruding and then embossing a polymer to form sheets of elongate, convex lenses. In order for these sheets to manipulate light in the right way to create functional invisibility shields, the lenses must have a highly specific shape and each one must be formed with high precision as they are very small. To find the best properties for a shield, we've spent years testing different lens shapes with varying profiles, angles, depths, focus points and separation distances.",
      "The shields perform at their absolute best against uniform backgrounds such as foliage, grass, rendered walls, sand, sky and asphalt. Backgrounds with defined horizontal lines work extremely well too and these can be natural features such as the horizon or man made features like walls, rails or painted lines.",

      "Crowdfunding Hamilton's newest & sweetest ice cream shop!",
      "Almost exactly a year ago I began my journey with Realfruity, popping up across Hamilton on the fruitybike & having the absolute time of my life. If you told me last June I\u2019d be working on opening a shop less than a year later, I\u2019d say you\u2019re nuts. But it\u2019s really happening. So many 'pinch me' moments in the past few weeks.",
      "Realfruity has always been about more than just ice cream & the shop will be no different. This is not your average ice cream store. This will be a space driven by community, FUN & quality feel-good ice cream. Westdale has been my home for 8 years now & I\u2019m excited to bring another space to the village that\u2019s focused on bringing people together. A cozy, happy, & inclusive place for people to gather. Cause that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.",
      "As I work with my friends to bring the space to life, I\u2019m trying my best to avoid borrowing from the banks & instead fund a good portion of this project by the community of realfruity supporters, the people who love ice cream & good vibes. The space I'm currently renovating was a cell phone shop before, essentially a blank canvas. So much to do, so much to build, so many ideas. Your contribution will help me bring elite equipment to Realfruity, upgrade the space to match the Realfruity vibe & truly bring this dream across the finish line. Any support you can offer is incredibly appreciated. I'm offering 3 Perk levels that make you a part of the Realfruity Founders Club. Each level comes with an equivalent gift card match, exclusive little perks & endless bragging rights. Read each description for more info.",
      "I've signed the lease & began the renovations. Like I mentioned before, this is a blank canvas. What was once a cell phone store is becoming an ice cream shop. Sadly I did not have the winter to plan out what the shop will look like, & how it will operate. This has all been so wildly unexpected. Day-by-day I'm creating my dream space by taking a very DIY approach to the renovations and design. I've involved the ones I love most on the project, my biggest supporters & the biggest realfruity fans. Amazing what people will do when you feed them ice cream. When it's all ready to go, you'll be visiting a space that has been curated with a whole lot of love by a collection of really awesome people. Yes, maybe it's taking a bit longer by this method, but that's the realfruity way. Community, friends, love & enjoying the process. The plans are being put to work, the ice cream bar, seating area, prep space, bike storage, & more.",
      "Do not worry, the bike will live on stronger than ever, popping up at events, parks, markets, parties, weddings, festivals & more, taking realfruity far & wide! The bike is such a big part of the brand & will pedal on forever, it's my pride & joy!",
      "You'll see the same real fruit ice cream & froyo you know & love but this time made-to-order with a new, elite (and very expensive) machine from New Zealand. This is the Ferrari of real fruit machines & I can promise is something you've probably never seen before. Providing the highest of quality and the prettiest of swirls. I hope to offer some delicious and unique hot treats, refreshing sparkling drinks & fun to-go ice cream cups with creative flavours I wasn't able to do before.",
      "Thank you for taking the time to consider contributing. If you\u2019ve supported realfruity in the past, whether through the purchase of an ice cream, inviting me to an event, or offering beautiful words of encouragement & excitement, thank you from the bottom of my heart. This is because of you.",

      "Super Stability & Super Handling make even the choppiest waters feel like silky smooth riding.",
      "XFoil 2 is a carbon fiber electric watercraft that can glide on the surface and fly above the water for riding in lakes, rivers, and oceans. It's the world's first hydrofoil with a computer-controlled gyro system with active moving control surfaces designed to automatically cancel turbulent waters/wind. XFoil's new game-changing technology, derived from fighter jets, enables super stability and super handling, making even the choppiest waters feel like silky smooth riding.",
      "\"We created XFoil because an awesome watercraft should not only be accessible to the elite. Everyone should be able to have a superior, no compromise top end hydrofoil at an affordable price.\" -Paul Lowchareonkul (XFoil Founder)",
      "*Spec based on Performance Long Range battery option.",
      "XFoil's gyro stability system, called \"Omega,\" implements technology derived from fighter jets. Central to the system is a 6-axis gyro that automatically senses changes in roll, pitch, and yaw, and counteracts these external forces 1000 times faster than any human, delivering the smoothest, most maneuverable, and easiest-to-ride hydrofoil ever created. The computer system enhances your control rather than working against it. You remain in full control, but with significant improvements.",
      "Today's hydrofoils are severely limited in their capabilities. Without moving control surfaces, similar to a hang glider, the rider's weight distribution on the craft is the sole means available for control. This method has limited effectiveness, as gusty winds for hang gliders and turbulent waters or winds for hydrofoils make stable control nearly impossible and dangerous to operate. XFoil's dynamic wings, derived from fighter jet technology, surpass fixed wings in nearly every aspect.",
      "XFoil is designed to be the easiest board to learn on. Whether you're a beginner or an expert to water sports, XFoil allows you to build riding confidence in progressive steps.  Learn on your own time and progress to the next riding style whenever you feel comfortable.",
      "XFoil can transform from a powered surfboard that rides on the surface of the water to a Hydrofoil board that rides above the water. Standup paddle board (SUP) configuration is also available for a pure foil riding experience. The electric motor can be attached to different mast assemblies to suit your desired riding preference.",
      "XFoil measures just 65.5 inches (166 cm) long, and is shorter than child size surf boards.",
      "XFoil 2 conveniently fits into mid-size sedans making transport to any water destination virtually effortless. The board weighs only 34 LBS (15.4 Kg)*.",
      "XFoil's lightweight carbon fiber construction is 5x stronger and 5x lighter than steel. Unlike other EFoils manufactured from inferior materials like fiberglass, EPS plastic, foam, or air inflatable, XFoil only uses the best hand-laid carbon fiber engineered to absorb waves, increase lift, and minimize drag while delivering unsurpassed comfort and control.",
      "Industry's smallest, and lightest eFoil wireless controller. Latest Bluetooth, magnetic touch trigger, and an OLED display. Waterproof IP68 can be submersed beyond 1m. Data telemetry, cruise control, anti-runaway, supreme control with multiple user profiles. Built-in lithium battery can operate up to 45 hours on a single charge with built-in wireless charger.",
      "XFoil 2 includes a 6000W (8HP) brushless maintenance free motor that can be detached with our patent pending mast attachment assembly allowing you to achieve surf, foil and SUP configurations by simply moving the motor from one mast to the other.",
      "Having the option for a detachable motor allows for future motor upgrades when new technologies emerge and makes it easier to service. The motor is Direct Drive. This means that the motor directly drives the propeller without the use of gears. Gears reduce the power transfer efficiency and creates unnecessary noise that disturb swimmers, sea life, etc. XFoil's direct drive system coupled with the High Performance Propeller is silent, making it the quietest EFoil.",
      "New Competition Toroidal Propeller (Shown Above)",
      "New Gen 2 lithium batteries for up to 160 minutes of ride time. Industry's highest voltage eFoil batteries operating up to 67.2V (14% higher than the nearest competitors). Higher voltage means less heat, better efficiency, more power on tap and longer run times.",
      "Utilizing the latest top grade cells with unsurpassed energy and power density while maintaining super light weight housed in aluminum armor. Standard Range batteries are lighter (15 LBS) ideal for sessions about 80 minutes. Long Range Performance battery is heavier great for long distance travel and sessions over 2.5 hours.",
      "XFoil has many mast configurations to choose from depending on your riding style",
      "XFoil's metal components are made from aircraft grade anodized 6061-T6 aluminum for superior strength, rigidity, corrosion resistance and lightweight.",

      "Introducing Pero, a wearable controller that makes your smart devices even smarter. Pero turns your simple hand motions into customizable shortcuts for your device. Now, you can control the cursor and input commands with this single device so that you can focus more on getting the job done.",
      "AAD function | Active Applicaiton Detection",
      "PERO can perform Active Application Detection through the User Custom Program. You can send separate commands according to each application, even with the same gesture.",
      "Provide customized settings according to gesture usage patterns",
      "Our \u201cUser Support Program\u201d analyzes your natural gesture habits and patterns to learn your command preferences. Instead of fitting your needs to predefined shortcuts, make your own shortcuts that meet your exact needs!",
      "Pero lets you control the user-interface with just your gestures alone.",
      "Yes, just like Minority Report but better. Since this is real. Turn your simple hand motions into customizable shortcuts for your device.",
      "We manage applications by type.",
      "UCP can manage many applications easily by dividing types according to popular shortcuts and commands. And new applications can be updated faster. These advantages, combined with the AAD function, help effectively control the commands of the application through the Pero.",
      "* Pero is not fully compatible with drone control at the moment. The video above is a demo test.",
      "Pero also gives you full range cursor control. It does everything you want your mouse to do and more.",
      "Comfortable Wrist",
      "The positioning of the arm while using Pero prevents the build up of pressure and pain in the wrist. But Ordinary mice force the wrist into a bent shape  which causes discomfort and pain over time",
      "When working with a mouse, you have to always work in the same pose and posture. However, you can work in a variety of poses and poses.",
      "PERO does not need space to control the cursor.",
      "So Pero reduces the time you spend moving between the mouse and trackpad. It also helps you use your computer efficiently even in a desk-free working environment.",
      "Think of the diverse purpose that each finger serves. The subtle differences in a tap, press, and pinch. The array of meanings they convey. We took the admiration of our nifty fingers to heart by utilizing their full potential in Pero. Its highly sensitive touch sensor recognizes each individual fingertip and when they\u2019re being pressed down.",
      "Simply connect it just like connect your wireless earbuds, easy and effortless! No external receiver needed. And PERO uses BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). So you can use 37 hours on a 30-minute charge.",
      "UCP is our team's best gift to PERO buyers.",
      "And so, after years of research and development, I came up with a device that could recognize gestures and translate it into specific commands. This is how Pero was born in 2017, but the current version of Pero is the most popular version among the people who participated in our user experience research tests (28 touch panel silicon insertion tests, 28 touch panel types, 9 product designs, 8 board modifications, and 8 sets of molds produced). We are doing our best and will continue to work hard in order to create innovative products that will provide incredible value for anyone!",
      "In order to make a recognition panel that can accurately recognize gestures even when worn roughly, a capacitive touch sensor was included in the design. However, it was necessary to make a panel to block the natural static electricity that can form in the palm while simultaneously recognizing the static electricity on the fingers. Eventually, we were able to succeed and ended up creating a thin but powerful discernment panel that accomplished everything we wanted it to accomplish.",
      "User support software is where we focused a lot of our efforts in order to make it easy and simple for anyone to use. In the future, we planning on further developing the software so that more third-party applications are integrated and that additional customized gestures can be recognized. In order to reach this next step, we will try to develop motion recognition optimization by making sure that Pero outputs can be analyzed by 2,800 data bits per second.",
      "Risks and challenges",
      "Our team has prepared to launch a crowdfunding for months. We understand that there are risks and challenges involved with launching and fulfilling a crowdfunding. In order to prevent any mistakes from occurring, we have partnered with several crowdfunding experts to cover each aspect of our campaign. That means that from campaign transparency to fulfilling rewards, we have every base covered. However, since this is our first time creating a product of this scale, there may be some unforeseen hurdles that we may have to overcome. If issues do arise and impact the quality of the product or delay the shipment of rewards then we will do our best to overcome the problem and be completely transparent with our backers.",

This proved our vision resonated.\n\nNow, we are writing the next chapter of pOrtahl\u00ae with Zenmaster. Join us on this adventure!",
      "Our brand name, pOrtahl\u00ae, is derived from the word \u201cportal.\u201d A gateway into another dimension. Instead of feeling stressed out, we want each little timetelling occasion to offer a brief escape from the hustle and bustle of daily life.",
      "The Zenmaster, inspired by Japanese zen gardens (\u67af\u5c71\u6c34, karesansui), embodies this philosophy. Zen gardens are designed for meditation and symbolize balance, simplicity, and peace\u2014offering a moment of calm in the midst of chaos.",
      "Subtle elements of Japanese culture and Zen Buddhism are carefully woven into the watch, inviting quiet reflection with every glance. You will find these little nods and references throughout the design, helping you tell a story about your watch to an enquiring stranger.",
      "One of the main features that sets the Zenmaster apart is its dial. Each one features a unique pattern, etched with ultimate precision to evoke the tranquillity of the carefully raked lines in a zen garden. No two watches are ever the same.",
      "WatchChris (170k subscribers)",
      "Design Atelier (27k subscribers)",
      "Our goal for the Zenmaster was to design an entry-level automatic watch, without compromising anything on quality or design. The Zenmaster had to emanate a sense of quiet luxury, while still being suited for everyday wear.",
      "We did our own sourcing, meeting with manufacturing and assembly partners in Switzerland, Hong Kong, China and the Netherlands. We have since created multiple prototypes that we have peer-reviewed, and real-world tested ourselves. We now present to you, Zenmaster. The culmination of months of research, designing, and testing.",
      "We firmly believe this is the next watch you are missing: 'The watch as unique as your fingerprint'.",
      "Let's dive into all the features we incorporated on the Zenmaster watch.",
      "Zenmaster's steel dial is one of the main attractions of this watch. Each and every Zenmaster dial is etched with its own unique pattern, reflecting the lines raked in the sand of a Japanese zen garden to evoke a sense of calm and balance.",
      "The zen patterns are created using a mathematical algorithm that is based on Truchet\u2019s 18th-century tiling concept. The result is that no two dials are ever the same, making your dial as uniquely yours as your own fingerprint.",
      "The concept of Truchet-tiles was first conceived by S\u00e9bastien Truchet, an 18th-century French mathematician and inventor. He introduced the idea of using repeating square tiles with fixed patterns that could be rotated individually to create highly intricate designs.",
      "Today, Truchet tiles are used in algorithmic design to create visually captivating and unique patterns, such as the ones found on the Zenmaster\u2019s dial.",
      "Our mathematical algorithm, based on this concept, dictates which tiles to turn and ensures that the pattern we create has never been created before, and will never be created again.",
      "The dial pattern can seem strong in photos, but in reality the lines disappear and reappear depending on how the light refracts on the dial, shifting between modest and outspoken.",
      "At pOrtahl\u00ae we love a sleek design. Our Zenmaster has a case size of 40.5 mm, and an incredibly slim case height of only 10.2 mm\u2014that's including crystal, no cheating\u2014 allowing it to slide effortlessly through any shirt sleeve.",
      "The case of the Zenmaster is crafted from highly durable coated 316L surgical grade stainless steel, with a sandblasted matte silver finish, a brushed finish along the sides, complemented by carefully polished details to communicate a sense of quiet luxury.",
      "At the heart of the design are our \u201chugger lugs\", which gracefully embrace the sides of the case. The lugs are inspired by the concept of Yin and Yang, with one lug bending slightly upward and the other down to symbolize balance.",
      "We incorporated a custom designed fluted bezel, in a sandblasted matte silver finish to perfectly blend in with the case, while adding texture. Inside of the case on the chapter ring, you'll find our Japanese lotus petal shaped markers on the 3, 6, 9 and 12 positions.",
      "Just like the case, the bracelet is made from IPH-coated surgical grade stainless steel (316L), it features a sandblasted finish with polished accents, echoing the case\u2019s contrast of textures.",
      "The bracelet is designed to have a fully integrated look, with a sleek butterfly clasp and a cleverly concealed connection to the case. In reality, the bracelet is easily interchangeable thanks to double quick-release pins.",
      "The concealed connection allows for personalization with any straight-ended 22 mm strap or bracelet, to create your own style, while still maintaining an integrated aesthetic. Check out how our Premium FKM rubber straps look on Zenmaster's case as an example!",
      "Each changeable link is secured with screw pins, a feature requested by our Facebook community of over 3,000 members. Screw pins allow for easy adjustment with the included tools. We're also throwing in 2 half links, for a perfect fit on every wrist.",
      "That means no visit to your local watch shop required for a size adjustment, you can easily size your newly unboxed Zenmaster yourself!",
      "Want to switch the bracelet out for one of our FKM Rubber straps, available in various colors that all look incredible on Zenmaster? See 'Add-ons' for more information.",
      "Why do you need a coating? You might be familiar with that dreaded moment when you look down at your favorite watch, and it has become marred with scratches, smudges, and signs of wear.",
      "Yeah, we hate that. One of our core design principles is to make watches that last lifetimes. That's why we always protect our watches with scratch-resistant coatings.",
      "It is extremely important for us that Zenmaster can be worn daily, but the thing is, a daily watch needs to endure A LOT. That's why we want Zenmaster to be able to take a beating, yet stay as pristine as the day you first unboxed it. So, we went searching for a coating that can do just that, and we found it.",
      "The Zenmaster\u2019s case, bezel, and bracelet are shielded by an A-grade Ion Plating Hardened (IPH) coating that ensures premium resilience against everyday wear and tear. With a hardness of 1,500 HV, our A-grade coating protects against scratches, fingerprints, and sweat, preserving the watch\u2019s clean matte finish.",
      "For reference, uncoated stainless steel has a hardness of only 200 HV, which means our coating increases the hardness of the stainless steel by 7.50x (!). While it doesn't mean it's indestructible, it does significantly increase Zenmaster's resistance to scratches.",
      "That way you can stay zen and maintain a scratch- and smudge-free appearance. Stay zen my friend.",
      "For the Zenmaster, we chose a tried-and-true Japanese automatic - the MIYOTA 9015 movement. The Cal. 9015 was first introduced in 2009 and is part of MIYOTA's Premium line of automatic movements.",
      "The MIYOTA 9015 is trusted by top-tier microbrands worldwide. This movement combines outstanding performance with a sleek profile, allowing the Zenmaster's case to be as slim as it is (10.2 mm including glass), while also housing a highly dependable movement with over 15 years of track record. The Cal. 9015 is well-known for its longevity, precision, and reliability.",
      "Zenmaster\u2019s rotor complements the zen garden pattern of the dial, providing a beautiful contrast to the movement, which is visible through the exhibition caseback. It is finished in rose gold IP to match the crown, indices, and hands.",
      "The Cal. 9015 gives the Zenmaster a clean sweep (8 beats per second) and offers a generous 42-hour power reserve, allowing you to take the watch off on the weekend for a quiet \"Zen Day\".",
      "The Zenmaster features sapphire crystal on both the front and the open caseback, chosen for its best-in-class clarity and durability. Ranking just below diamond on the Mohs hardness scale, sapphire crystal offers exceptional scratch resistance.",
      "Our sapphire crystal is treated with an anti-reflective coating, offering a glare-free view of your one-of-a-kind zen dial and the MIYOTA-movement from every angle.",
      "Our rose gold crown is a screw-down, a feature that was highly requested by our private community of 3,000+ members on Facebook. It features the pOrtahl\u00ae ring engraving on the side.",
      "After unscrewing the crown, it can be pulled out into three different positions; manual winding position, date-setting position and the time-setting position.",
      "The watch hands come in a rose gold IP-finish that adds warmth and sophistication to the dial, contrasting beautifully with the cool matte tones of the case.",
      "The hour and minute hands feature a classic dauphine style, a shape that originated in the mid-20th century. Its inception and increasing popularity is often credited to Patek Philippe.",
      "The seconds hand features pOrtahl\u2019s signature ring-shaped counterweight, finished with a matte silver tip.",
      "pOrtahl\u00ae offers a 2-year international warranty on our Zenmaster watch, meaning we will repair or replace your Zenmaster watch within 2 years of delivery if it suffers from any mechanical, manufacturing, or assembly defects. This warranty does not cover damages resulting from misuse, or any cosmetic damage such as scratches or marks to the finish, which under the conditions of the warranty constitute regular wear and tear. Opening the caseback outside of an authorized repair will render the warranty null and void. In the unlikely event that your Zenmaster suffers from a mechanical defect, please contact us immediately, and we will offer you a fitting solution.",
      "Further customize your Zenmaster look with a variety of FKM rubber straps. FKM rubber is highly resistant to wear and tear, which is why it's often used in the aerospace and automotive industries.",
      "You'll notice when you pick your straps up out of the box that they're unexpectedly weighty. That's because of the super high density of FKM rubber. It's the highest quality rubber you can find.",
      "You can now pick your favorite color(s) and add them to your rewards during checkout! All straps pre-ordered during our crowdfunding campaign are 41% OFF RETAIL.",
      "Just like Peacemaker, we have designed Zenmaster fully in-house. In this chapter we want to share our vision on watch design with you.",
      "At pOrtahl\u00ae we have 5 design goals that make up our design ethos for any watch that we are ever going to create.",
      "1. Your daily choice - our watches are designed for daily wear, making them tempting to put on every single morning.",
      "2. Conversation pieces - our watches are conversation starters, designed to help you tell a story.",
      "3. Lasting lifetimes -  our watches are engineered to last and to be passed on from generation to generation.",
      "4. Designed with you in mind - our watches are designed for the wearer, eliminating common frustrations and ensuring the best possible experience.",
      "5. Make every time-telling occasion special - our watches are not just objects, they invoke emotional connections.",
      "Note that the watch in the photos is a prototype and that we are still looking to make a number of improvements on the production version that will be shipped out to backers. Let\u2019s go over what we still want to improve and what you can expect from the Zenmaster watch you will receive when we get successfully funded.",
      "With these improvements, we are confident that we will be able to provide all of our backers and future customers with a high quality watch that lives up to our standards and your expectations. We are extremely excited for you to have the final version in-hand and on-wrist. With your help we can make that happen!",
      "At pOrtahl\u00ae we are obsessed with our promise to deliver.",
      "During our last crowdfunding campaign for Peacemaker, we gave backers zero customization options. The reason was that our research showed many projects failed to deliver due to the logistics and manufacturing complexities that customization brings. After all, every variant that was ordered has to be manufactured according to order and shipped out to the right person, even if it was only one.",
      "At the same time, one of our main points of feedback on our last crowdfuning campaign was the absence of customization options. To accommodate the wish for backers to make rewards their own through customization, we went looking for a way to make that possible without shooting ourselves in the foot.",
      "Especially with the success of our last campaign, we feel more comfortable this time to experiment with customization. That's why backers can now customize their Zenmaster look with FKM rubber straps in a variety of colors. Your selected FKM rubber strap(s) can be ordered as add-ons during checkout and will ship out with your order.",
      "Just like last time; we aim to deliver your watch on time, to your doorstep, as promised.",
      "My name is Alain (on the right) and I co-founded pOrtahl\u00ae  together with Jordi (on the left). We met when Jordi became my supervisor, back when I was doing an internship at a marketing agency in 2015. We became best friends over our shared love for product design and we started working together shortly after finishing my internship. We have been talking about creating a watch together ever since we met, but we finally started working on it in 2020.",
      "In 2021 we launched our first watch, called Peacemaker, on Kickstarter and Indiegogo. It was a bigger success than we had ever imagined. 222 backers helped make our dream come true, helping us raise over $120,000 and manufacturing our first watch.",
      "We\u2019re back with our next watch: Zenmaster. It\u2019s inspired by Japanese Zen gardens, where the patterns raked in the gravel are an invitation to pause, breathe and reflect. A place for meditation and quiet reflection. That idea really stuck with us. We wanted to bring that same feeling into a watch.",
      "With Zenmaster, our goal was to build an entry-level automatic. Something accessible, but without cutting corners. It had to feel special, one-of-a-kind. Sleek enough to dress up, tough enough for daily wear. Quiet luxury that doesn\u2019t scream for attention. To us, the Zenmaster watch serves as a base for the collection that follows.",
      "And of course, it ties into what pOrtahl\u00ae  has always stood for. The deeper meaning behind our brand name is about turning that stress you often feel when checking the time into a tiny escape from the hustle and bustle of daily life, even just for a second. Allowing your mind to go through a portal into something a feeling of calm.",
      "If you're curious to see more watches like this\u2014we\u2019d love your support. Back our campaign, join the journey, and help us bring this unique watch into existence!",
      "Thank you so much for being here. Let\u2019s build Zenmaster together.",
      "Hopefully yours,",

      "Your plant's best friend. With horticultural lighting, automated watering & smart-home integration!",
      "Light requirement of plants varies across their growth stages - germination, seedling, vegetative growth and flowering/ fruit bearing stages. It also vastly varies across plant types. Our aim was to make a universal product that could help anyone get the best growth with ease. The solution was to make multi-channel variable spectrum lights. To make it easy to operate, we devised Presets on an app.",
      "Each CURA Light incorporates a majority of full-spectrum white LEDs of a certain specification, a secondary full-spectrum white with another, along with specialized reds and blues. Each Preset is a combination of these wavelengths.",
      "Great for vegetative growth with a healthy root and stem structure, and reduces stretching.",
      "Stimulates photosynthesis and promotes biomass growth, essential for reproductive functions.",
      "There are Presets available for Herbs & Greens, Flowers & Fruits, Germination, Indoor Garden Plants and more. You could also make custom Presets for each plant and share with others.",
      "No more seasonal growing, no more pushing planters to the windows.",
      "With CURA, you could grow around the year like its spring. When provided the ideal wavelengths, plants grow up to 50% faster than being on window sills. With the right lighting and nutrition, plant stems are thicker, leaves have more mass with shorter nodes; you would also notice quicker flowering and fruition.",
      "Growing at home was never so tempting and convenient.",
      "Herbs and greens so fresh, you don't even need to rinse them. Flavors and aroma that takes you back in memories. CURA makes this happen all through the year. Harvest herbs, greens, veggies, berries, and fruits like a Pro, with surprising yields and regularity.",
      "Brighten up the low-lit corners of your home with plants.",

      "No more under watering, over watering, forgetfulness, or guesswork.",
      "Within the elegant aluminum enclosure, the CURA Pump contains a peristaltic pump that operates with high precision and low noise. It runs for a few minutes every day - schedule as set with the App - and provides drip watering through the tube to the base of the plant.",
      "Water is drawn from the reservoir, which rests beneath the planter and could suffice for weeks, to cover a vacation. Alternatively, you could draw water from a bottle or another source besides the planter. One CURA pump could service three planters in the vicinity and is daisy-chained to the CURA Light using the included short cable.",

      "CURA comes in 3 different sizes: 200mm (8'), 300mm (12')and 400mm (16').",
      "You would choose them based on the canopy spread of the plants. If in doubt, go for a bigger size. With small herbs, CURA 200/300 could cover more than one plant, if kept as a close cluster.  For big house plants, CURA 400 would do great.",

      "Introducing Little Sophia, Sophia the Robot's little sister",
      "Little Sophia is the little sister of Sophia and the newest member of the Hanson Robotics family. She is 14\u201d tall, and your robot friend that helps make learning STEM, coding and AI a fun and rewarding adventure for kids 8+ years old, especially girls.",
      "Little Sophia can walk, talk, sing, play games and, like her big sister, tell jokes. With Little Sophia's software, and included tutorials through Hanson's AI Academy, she is a unique programmable, educational companion for kids, inspiring children to learn through a safe, interactive, human-robot experience. Kids, educators and even Sophia the Robot fans, regardless of age, will find Little Sophia irresistible!",
      "The team behind Little Sophia is comprised of a diverse and renowned global group of engineers, scientists, roboticists, toy makers, character developers, designers and AI experts, many of whom helped build Sophia the Robot.",
      "One of our many goals at Hanson Robotics is to support and encourage the future scientists, developers, engineers and roboticists that will shape our world tomorrow.  Research has shown that science achievement gaps emerge by kindergarten and these gaps continue until at least the end of eighth grade.",
      "The growth of STEM jobs in the future is expected to skyrocket. However, there's a lack of women in these fields meaning fewer female role models, both for current female STEM employees, and for girls still forming career choices. There\u2019s no evidence that girls are less capable in these fields, but rather that they often \u2018feel\u2019 less capable, partly due to stereotyping. Stats vary by country and by discipline, but generally speaking, women make up only 15-25% of the current STEM workforce, and the gap is broadening.",
      "We believe that Little Sophia can help to introduce STEM, coding and AI to children - especially girls - in a fun, safe, inspiring and interactive way that will  make a difference in reversing the current trends.",
      "Little Sophia delivers a high-quality, entertaining and educational experience so young students are highly motivated to spend time learning with her. The interaction between Little Sophia and users focuses on storytelling and learning new things. She's not just another robot toy built by a toy company, Little Sophia has been designed and built by the same renowned scientists, roboticists and engineers who built Sophia the Robot.",
      "Little Sophia has the same endearing personality as Sophia the Robot. She is intensely curious, refreshingly innocent, and uniquely playful. She is the only consumer robot with a human-like face who can generate a wide range of human facial expressions. She not only responds to commands, but also actively engages in conversations. This unparalleled responsiveness together with her humanoid design makes Little Sophia a smart, educational companion.",

      "Improvements & Testing \u2013 We are working on waterproofing, making the device more compact, and adding useful features.  (In Progress)",
      "Presentation & Sharing \u2013 We will present our project and demonstrate how it works. (Coming Soon!)",
      "While we do not expect our next version to be fully diving-ready, we now understand how challenging waterproofing is. However, we are confident that our next prototype will be an exciting STEM learning kit that both children and adults can use in shallow water to experience underwater communication technology.",
      "Why Do We Care?",
      "We love learning about the ocean and how technology can make a difference. Diving is an amazing experience, but communication and safety remain huge challenges. By creating an affordable and easy-to-use solution, we hope to help scientists, emergency responders, and everyday divers communicate more effectively.",
      "Although we are just starting out, we are excited to keep improving our project and make a real impact in the world of underwater exploration!",

      "Blizwheel is a 15.6-inch e-scooter that\u2019s so compact, you can put it in your backpack or place it nicely in your desk drawer while you work.",
      "When you\u2019re not riding around, you can leave Blizwheel standing without needing to hold it. So if you need to stop by a store or use your phone while waiting for the train, you can comfortably do so.",
      "Depending on your needs, Blizwheel can be folded completely to be carried around by its handle or halfway so you can tow it around on its wheel.",
      "Safely maneuver the city with rear and front LED lights equipped with a fully functioning turn signal.",
      "Tired of walking a long way for that \"last mile\"? Blizwheel can connect you much faster to your destination, after getting off at the bus stop, metro, or a distant parking lot. It\u2019s also perfect to get around campus. Parking won\u2019t be a problem -  just fold it up and take it with you inside the classroom.",
      "Blizwheel is incredibly smooth to ride thanks to a special PU suspension which gives it the same height clearance as larger scooters and makes it easier to turn.",
      "But cutting corners isn\u2019t an option in Blizwheel\u2019s power. Its dual motors give greater speed and better acceleration. Blizwheel will become your all-around personal commute from bumpy, tight street corners to flat, open spaces.",

We are enthusiasts of innovative product development. In late 2017, our team launched Blizwheel E-Skates. Although the campaign was unsuccessful, we were able to acquire all the technologies required to develop extremely small electric vehicles. Being optimists, we didn't give up and got together again as a team in 2019. This time around, we hope Blizwheel will reach more people and encourage the use of electric vehicles.",

      "In our tech-centric world, we're constantly juggling multiple smart devices. Whether we're working remotely, traveling, or just on the go, keeping everything charged up can be a hassle. Are you tired of carrying around a tangled mess of cables for all your devices?",
      "Enter Chargeasap's solution: a 100W magnetic cable that's powerful, fast, durable, and incredibly convenient. Say goodbye to cable clutter and hello to simplicity with one cable for all your charging needs!",

Charge your iPhone at maximum speed, reducing the iPhone 14 Pro Max charging time from empty to full in just about 1 hour and 30 minutes. Overcoming Apple chip restrictions, this achievement marks a significant milestone that earlier magnetic cables couldn't achieve. We're proud to lead as the first magnetic cable capable of supporting both Apple iPhone 14 and 15 max charging speeds.",
      "You may have noticed we love incorporating screens into our products (and our customers love it too), so why not extend this feature to our magnetic cables? Connect Pro is the first magnetic cable to feature a built-in power reader showcased on a stylish LED screen. Now, you can easily monitor your device's charging progress and speed. Pretty neat, huh?",
      "Stop buying different cables for all your devices or when companies alter their charging ports\u2014looking at you, Apple.

      "We've already manufactured 200 functional samples, that are currently being distributed to major media publications, influencers and our beta testers for hands-on testing. Excited to share the reviews with you soon!",
      "Since the final mold for Connect Pro is locked in and approved, we're set to kick off production right after the live campaign wraps up\u2014or possibly even sooner.",
      "When Chargeasap develops new products, extensive research goes into finding the right manufacturing partner. For our 12th crowdfunding campaign, we've partnered with a large, experienced cable factory. Consolidating Connect Pro's production in this factory helps reduce delays common with outsourced tasks. With our background in creating high-quality mobile phone accessories and fulfilling many orders, we've gained insights from challenges in manufacturing and shipping, especially during the uncertainties of COVID-19.",
      "We're geared up for another fantastic campaign ahead! :)",
      "What sets Connect Pro apart from the competition? Well, let's dive in:",
      "With a larger power output and an LED display providing real-time battery percentage, all in a single magnetic cable.",
      "Superior features, specifications, and value for your money.",
      "Leave laptop tripping accidents in the past with our Magsafe inspired connector, ensuring a snag-free experience and peace of mind. Say goodbye to worries and start your day smoothly with our yank-safe connection.",
      "Our magnetic connection simplifies phone charging in any situation, whether you're driving, on-the-go, in a meeting, or gaming. It's user-friendly, allowing easy one-handed connections and disconnections\u2014ideal for everyone, including those with dexterity challenges. No more struggling to plug in devices, even in the dark.",
      "Ever plugged in your phone at night, only to find it dead in the morning? Connect Pro's LED light turns green when charging is successful, so you'll always know your device is connected and charging. Never worry about leaving your device uncharged again!",
      "Our cable sets feature N52 grade neodymium magnets, known as the world's strongest commercial grade magnets. These magnets are powerful enough to support up to 1.1kg (2.4lb), including devices like the iPad Pro. Trusted by over 300,000 customers since 2016, they highlight our commitment to quality and durability.",
      "Since our Infinity magnetic cable series, we've made significant upgrades, including increasing magnet thickness by 9% from 6.8mm (Infinity) to 7.4mm (Connect Pro) for a stronger magnetic connection. This enhancement is complemented by an innovative locking mechanism, ensuring a more secure connection and longer lifespan.",
      "Each cable set includes a 1.2m (3.9ft) cable and tip of your choice (USB-C, Apple (Lightning) or Micro USB), with an optional 2m (6.5ft) cable available separately, providing durability and lasting value for all your devices.",
      "Just insert the tip into your device and snap on the cable to charge!",
      "With USB cables, you often need different ones for each device, leading to tangles and compatibility issues. USB aims to be universal, so why not create a cable that truly fits that name?",
      "Our goal is one cable for all your gadgets \u2014 phones, tablets, and USB devices.

      "Crafted from high-quality materials like military-grade tangle-free nylon, they offer durability and reliability. Thicker cables handle higher currents for faster charging, reinforced with 4 x 3000D nylon braids for added strength.",
      "We've rigorously tested these cables with a bend test machine, subjecting them to over 15,000 bends at 180 degrees to ensure they withstand daily use. They also feature an anti-fray neck design to minimize fraying or snapping at common weak points, extending their lifespan.",
      "Magnetic cables also shield your phone port from dust and dirt. Leaving the tip in place reduces the wear and tear caused by daily insertions and removals, further preserving your phone port.",
      "Why our customers loved our Infinity cables!",
      "If you've bought our Infinity range before, we know you're wondering how and why this cable is different. Besides upgrading the tech, we've also improved its design based on the feedback we've gotten over the years, so it gives you an even better experience.",
      "Most phone manufacturers now offer their own \"fast charge technology\" with their latest devices. Check the table above to see if your device can use third-party cables for this technology. Devices with proprietary charging require their official cables for maximum speed. When using Connect Pro, the cable will still charge your device at the maximum speed possible without integrating proprietary charge technology.",
      "In order to achieve international certification for safe use, all cables are put through a number of rigorous industrial tests to ensure Connect Pro can withstand daily use.",

      "If you'd like to  purchase any of the add-on items, you will be emailed a survey 14 days after the campaign finishes from BackerKit where you can:",
      "All rewards will be delivered via air freight directly from our distribution centre in Shenzhen, China. Backers are also expected to receive rewards between 4-21 days from shipping depending on the size of the delivery and your country (including USA). We've chosen this costlier method so no matter what country you're supporting from you don't have the long transportation times of sea freight.",
      "Chargeasap is a consumer electronics startup originating from Sydney with a global team who believe users should be the creators and innovators of products. We realize that your mobile phone is the one object you interact with every day more than any other object or person, so why not simplify this interaction?",
      "Our mission is to create highly innovative phone accessories that keep your devices fully charged at all times to truly keep up with your life on the go.",

      "We've already invested over $100,000 toward NRE (non-recurring engineering) costs to get the prototypes up and running and cover a big chunk of the initial mold fee. To get Connect Pro off the ground, we need the support of Kickstarter backers to help fund the materials for the first production run.",

      "The new Model 6 Carbon Fiber is an all-new design with an elegantly curved shape and both fine and wide teeth.  At 7 inches (17.8 cm) long, it's the perfect comb for your everyday styling.  And it's even versatile enough to be used by professional barbers, such as Bobby Price, the renowned Chicago barber featured in our video.",
      "2.  These are the best combs you've ever used",
      "There are a lot of problems with traditional plastic hair combs.  One concern is that many of them are made of cheap plastic which uses sketchy chemicals such as formaldehyde as a main component.  Customers often aren't even aware of this until they develop a skin allergy or other problem.",
      "Our new combs are made of an ultra high quality carbon fiber composite manufactured to the highest standards of quality and safety.  An added benefit is that carbon fiber is also naturally anti-static, unlike traditional plastic combs which can give you unpleasant \"static shock.\"  These new combs are also heat- and chemical-resistant, unlike regular combs, and are far more durable.",
      "Because carbon fiber has such amazing qualities, it is also used in professional grade applications from luxury cars to high-end sporting equipment and aerospace.",
      "Another problem with traditional plastic combs is poor design and manufacturing practices which results in a cheap product that can damage your hair.  Our new combs are designed with more gently rounded tips and surfaces, so the comb won't scratch your head or pull on your hair like cheap combs do.  We've also spent extensive time perfecting the manufacturing processes to ensure the combs have amazing finish quality.",
      "Like all our products, these new combs are 100% made in USA.",
      "3.  What we're using the funds for",
      "Your pledge to the Indiegogo campaign will help fund the cost of manufacturing and marketing these cutting edge Carbon Fiber combs.  All of the combs are in stock and being shipped now!",
      "4.  You can support this campaign with confidence, as we've been making the world's finest combs combs since 2011",
      "Chicago Combs are sold in dozens of countries worldwide and have been featured GQ, Men's Journal, Allure, ABC News, CBS News, Art of Manliness, Monocle, the Chicago Sun-Times, and many other publications.  Chicago Comb has also been a two-time finalist for the Martha Stewart American Made award, and in 2018 was the only company to receive the New Exporter Award from the Governor of Illinois!",

      "Safe, Simple, Urban Friendly. The game-changer for backyard or balcony beekeeping.",
      "b-box is a revolutionary hive design that completely innovates home beekeeping. With patent-pending technology that allows you to monitor your bees and harvest honey without disturbing your hive \u2013 b-box is harmony with nature at its best.",
      "Safety is a priority with b-box. Keeping bees at home means your hive is constantly surrounded by people - including children! That's why b-box has exclusive features that allow you to care for your bees without disturbing or agitating them.",
      "Our patent-pending honey harvesting system is easy to use and requires no protective clothing. Even better, no bees get squished in the harvesting process. Plus, you only have to take a small portion of honey each time \u2013 leaving enough for your bees to have some too!",
      "Tiny apartment? No garden in sight? Backyard beekeeping is no longer just for people with backyards! b-box requires less than 1 meter square of space so even those without large outdoor areas can enjoy b-box and join the home beekeeping movement.",
      "The whole family can appreciate b-box with the bee viewer! Observe and monitor your bees up close and personal with b-box.",
      "b-box is, at its core, a bee hive. We aren\u2019t pretending otherwise! But the traditional beehive we all think of today was invented over 150 years ago for professional use. It\u2019s time that home beekeeping caught up with modern technology! That\u2019s why we\u2019ve re-engineered the traditional beehive to be more people and bee friendly \u2013 not to mention better adapted for domestic use.",
      "Bee Chimney: Did you know that in nature honey bees even build their hives in rock crevices high above the ground? That was our inspiration for the bee chimney \u2013 if we could move the entrance and exit point of bees away from human level we could reduce negative interactions between keepers and their bees.",
      "Bee Viewer: In traditional hives you have to disrupt your bees to check on their health. Imagine if a giant suddenly took the roof off your house! With b-box, regularly agitating (and sometimes squishing) your bees is no longer necessary. Polycarbonate walls (the same material as shatterproof windows and eyeglass lenses) are hidden below the warm and cozy wood exterior panels of b-box, allowing you to observe your hive anytime you like! See them at work, storing honey and building honeycomb as you please. This also means you can monitor your bees\u2019 health without disturbing the hive.",
      "Patent Pending Honey Harvesting System: This may be the most revolutionary part of b-box. With the pull of a lever you can separate the honeycomb chamber from the rest of the hive. Bees will be able to exit the honeycomb chamber but not enter and the chamber empties out within a few hours. Then you can harvest your honey in a bee free environment! No protective clothing required. And, even more importantly, no bees die in the process!",
      "Modular Honeycomb: Sometimes we forget that honey is our bees' food too! That\u2019s why we developed our modular honeycomb \u2013 by taking only one of our 16 mini honeycomb frames instead of a large sheet you can control exactly what impact your honey consumption has on your hive\u2019s health.",
      "Customizable Hive: The body of b-box is a customizable hive space that allows you to organize your bees\u2019 home however you see fit. Whether you\u2019d prefer to fill it with traditional frames or give your bees some room to create their own structure just like in nature, b-box let\u2019s you do it!",
      "beeing has received recognition from a variety of prominent organizations across the globe. Volvo named beeing as one of the most environmentally conscious startups in Italy through their Taste of Volvo program. National Geographic wrote about their past projects in measuring air quality through the analysis of honey. And the Climate-KIC program supported by the European Union, invested in the development of b-box.",
      "The story of beeing started two generations ago, with Roberto's (left) grandparents. They kept bees in the Italian countryside and those traditions have been handed down. Combining that traditional knowledge with Gabriele's (right) passion for technology and innovation  \u2013 beeing was born!",
      "We are already a fixture in the beekeeping community in Italy \u2013 offering anti-theft technology for traditional hives and providing regular education opportunities and community initiatives. We even created and ran an innovative program that looked at air quality and environmental pollution in 20 different cities through the analysis of honey. We\u2019ve learned a lot from working so closely with professional beekeepers across the country and have brought this expertise to the creation of b-box.",
      "We\u2019ve been working for three years on our innovative hives and it is finally time to bring them to you! After 10 b-box prototypes and 12 months of beta testing,  b-box is now ready to bring to market. But we need your help to make it happen!",

Since our product is already production ready, Indiegogo is our place to bring together pioneers who are just as passionate about the bees as we are and are ready for the next era in beekeeping.

      "Wireless charging has never been this phenomenal. Fast, easy, clutter-free, invisible and eye-catchy. Imagine you simply set phone on top of a clean desk and it starts charging automatically. That would just make people go WOW!",
      "iMAG W1 spot for invisible/hidden installation that brings convenient, fast and cable-free charging into all sorts of environments(public, office, home, restaurant, etc.). Universally-compatible, Qi-certified charging pads are easily installed at any location to provide an enhanced user experience in any environment.",
      "In fact, It\u2019s the most compatible invisible wireless charger in the world that charges through 45mm thick surface!",
      "W1\u2019s patented transmitter tech enables a wider transmission range of electrons through a thicker barrier(45mm) and juice up your device wirelessly. It\u2019s the most penetrating invisible wireless charger in the world! That means W1 suits most of the table/desk/counter on the market. So you don\u2019t have to worry about compatibility, it has no hassle charging through a very thick surface.",
      "*Please note that the iMAG W1 30mm and iMAG W1 45mm are of the same size but of different weights. Also, the iMAG W1 45mm needs to have a pre-installed receiver/ sticker on the table surface for optimum results.",
      "The iMAG W1 Fast Wireless Charger is very convenient to use. It removes wire from wireless charger and transforms any surface into a fast-charging dock. And the best thing is you won\u2019t have to deal with wires or cluttered surfaces; it is a convenient and neat way to keep your phone powered up and the surroundings clutter-free.",
      "Easily keep your desk tidy with the iMAG W1. The feeling a clean desk gives you is energizing and sometimes inspiring. The desk is clean, you are focused and work is going to get done!",
      "Apply iMAG W1 is very easy, no construction experience required. Steps are as follows:",
      "Compare to the regular hidden wireless charger on the market, iMAG W1 is much easier to install.No construction needed, and no damage to the furniture. Just as easy to set up as 1-2-3-4! A true Plug-and-Play experience.",
      "iMAG W1 is equally as strong charging through most table materials including wood, plastic, glass, quartz, granite, marble among others. It can also charge through phone cases!",
      "Just out of sight but not out of mind, the iMAG W1 charges your phone in an invisible form in a range of environments thereby keeping each surface neat and clutter-free. This allows you to go about your activities without worrying about messy surfaces or the risk of tripping over wires.",
      "We have adopted a special coil manufacturing process to ensure the accuracy of the coil parameters and realize ample fixed frequency fast charging based on inductive magnetic resonance.",
      "The double-layer Alpha winding method is used to solve the influence of ordinary winding mode, adding efficiency and contributing towards the symmetry, thickness and performance of the charger while eliminating leakages.",

      "Hi, I'm Gavin - I am obsessed with food (cooking and most importantly, eating it!) and I'm constantly dreaming up inventions or techniques to make my life easier, especially in the kitchen where I spend most of my time.",
      "The kitchen is where the design for SCOUPS was born. I wanted a tough ladle with a soft silicone top that could mold and softly scrape the bottom and sides of pots and pans to 'SCOUP' up every last drop.",
      "Whether you're a chef, cook, baker or a foodie, you know how sad it is to leave food behind because your plastic or metal ladle just can't get to the bottom and sides of your pots and pans. We are so excited to finally launch SCOUPS with its specially designed soft-top. No soup left behind!",
      "SCOUPS is the ladle of your dreams. Not only is it a strong and colourful ladle but it's also a spatula and a measuring cup. SCOUPS is going to be your new BFF in the kitchen.",
      "You will always have the right tool in your hand with SCOUPS.",
      "The patented design of SCOUPS is simple but effective. The sturdy soft-top head holds just over 3/4 cup. But then by applying a small amount of pressure, the soft half of the head molds against the inside of your pot, so you can easily SCOUP up every last drop. Once the pressure is released, the soft-top head will snap back into shape.",
      "I also noticed that metal and hard plastic ladles would damage my nonstick pots and pans by scraping the bottom. So I created SCOUPS to have a silicone outer layer to softly scrape without damaging your pots and pans.",
      "We didn't want to design another boring monochrome ladle so we created SCOUPS in 3 delightful color combinations to bring a little happiness to your kitchen.",
      "We added useful ML and Cup measurements on the inside of the soft-top head to help make your cooking and baking easy peasy.",
      "There's no need to rummage around for measuring cups or constantly changing utensils when you're making pancakes, chilli or soup. SCOUPS can measure, softly scrape and scoop.",
      "SCOUPS is BPA Free and dishwasher safe. While we don't recommend accidentally putting SCOUPS in your oven, SCOUPS has a very high heat resistance (392 \u00b0F / 200 \u00b0C). For reference, you should not serve soup hotter than 210\u00b0F (99\u00b0C).",
      "As production has just been completed and the shipment is on its way to us, you (the backer) will not have to wait long to receive the SCOUPS Spoon. Shipment should arrive in Toronto at the end of sept and we can start shipping out the SCOUPS Ladle to you in October.",
      "Production Completed!!",
      "While developing this product, we took our time to make sure we designed the best possible product for you. We wanted to make sure the ladle did what it was supposed to while being able to withstand the rough and tumble of a kitchen utensils' daily life. We had to rigorously test, redesign and change materials numerous times to make sure the spoon is exactly how we wanted. And now we have the spoon in our hands, we think this has been completely worth it.",
      "We partnered with an experienced kitchen utensil manufacturer and they have been involved in the design process from the beginning offering advice and modifications to make the product better, stronger and more useful. We\u2019ve already invested in tooling and production has already been completed. As with any production, there are always variables that are not entirely under our control, but we are confident that by having a robust design and by working with trustworthy suppliers and manufacturers, we are reducing as many risks as possible to have a smooth production process and deliver on time.",

No more fears of cyber attacks or missing critical codes. Simplify your life with our gadget and enjoy peace of mind.",
      "Are you tired of the hassle and frustration of keeping track of your PIN codes and passwords? We understand - it's not easy to remember them all, let alone ensure they're all secure. But unfortunately, the risks of cyber attacks and data breaches are very real, and it only takes one weak password to compromise your entire online presence.",
      "That's why we're thrilled to introduce PIN-Master\u00ae - the solution to all your password and PIN code woes. With PIN-Master\u00ae, you can enjoy the peace of mind that comes with knowing your data is secure and accessible when you need it. Say goodbye to the fear of being hacked or forgetting a critical code - PIN-Master\u00ae is completely offline and cannot be hacked.",
      "Say hello to a simpler, safer, and more efficient way of managing your codes and passwords.",
      "PIN-Master\u00ae is 100% Safe and Secure. It is offline and cannot be hacked. Use it for your most critical and important codes. Especially those you would never store on your Mobile, in an App, in the Cloud or in any online Password Manager.",
      "Why do we feel so confident that no one can hack your PIN-Master\u00ae?",
      "We are using an AES encryption. However, the encryption of the data is actually the fourth layer of security as:",
      "1. You MUST first obtain the physical product.",
      "2. You MUST know the Master Key as all data is automatically erased (swiped off) if a wrong Master Code is entered 3 times (software programing). This means 3 attempts out of 100 million different combinations, and it is not possible to let a computer automatically key in all the combinations.",
      "3. The microprocessor LOCK Bits are activated which means no data can be retrieved from the microprocessor.",
      "4. Should someone be able to steal the work tools from the microprocessor manufacturer and break the microprocessor LOCK Bits, then the data is AES encrypted.",
      "This is why PIN-Master\u00ae is the Most Secure & Compact Password Manager in the world.",
      "Either passwords are easy to crack or hard to remember. To avoid hacking you must create stronger passwords which become even more difficult to remember.",
      "PIN-Master\u00ae allows you to create stronger passwords which are available when you need them. This will also give you a greater incentive to create even stronger passwords, and limit a bad habit of re-using old passwords for different services, as you never have to worry about whether you can actually remember your passwords again. This brings Security and Peace of Mind.",
      "PIN-Master\u00ae can store all your codes. You can keep all your codes in one place and have them ready by hand when you need them. PIN-Master\u00ae can store codes which consist of numbers, letters (both CAPITAL and lower cases) and other symbols and special characters, so all sorts of codes can be managed.",
      "One significant issue is password security, with weak passwords being a primary target for cybercriminals. Most hacking related breaches are due to weak or stolen passwords. Reduce the risk of hacking and potential theft of your IT identity by using strong passwords. According to the Verizon 2021 Data Breach Investigations Report, 61% of data breaches in 2020 involved credential data such as passwords.",
      "Cybersecurity is an essential consideration in our digital age, with cybercrime becoming more prevalent every year. According to a report by Cybersecurity Ventures, global cybercrime costs are expected to reach $10.5 trillion annually by 2025. In addition, the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center received over 791,790 complaints of suspected internet crime in 2020, representing an increase of almost 70% from the previous year.",
      "PIN-Master\u00ae addresses this issue by providing a secure and offline way to store and manage passwords.",
      "Today access codes are used everywhere. Whether it is PIN Codes, Passwords, User-ids, Login codes, Passport numbers or Bank accounts. And we are expected to memorize these by heart.",
      "We have deliberately made PIN-Master\u00ae \"crypto friendly\" by accommodating requirements from owners of crypto currencies, who are seeking a secure offline device where private keys and recovery phrases for their hardware wallets can be safely stored.",
      "Do you have codes which really ought not to be stored on your Mobile, in an App, in the Cloud or in any online Password Manager? And are you aware that even the most popular online Passwords Managers have been hacked? That's why we are different, we are 100% offline!",
      "You never have to worry again that your codes are stolen or that you are caught in an unpleasant situation - standing in a long queue and suddenly you cannot remember your PIN Code..... (we have all tried it).",
      "This is really like an insurance policy - you hope you never need it - but if you suddenly do - then you are pleased you signed up for it! Carry PIN-Master\u00ae as your personal security knowing that you will never be caught off guard again. Isn't this worth 20 cents per day? (Retail Price US$79 divided by 365 days - and actually it lasts for years - so the investment is much lower than 5 cents per day!).",
      "PIN-Master\u00ae 2.0 is an upgraded product which was developed after the successful Kickstarter launch of PIN-Master\u00ae 1.0 in March 2020.",

      "High-end carbon fiber bicycles are favored on the market. However, when a pure carbon frame has a cycling collision, the pure carbon frame breaks into sharp fragments, which is easy to hurt people and poses great safety risks. To solve this problem and develop materials with better performance and more safety, 3V cooperated with a team of doctors in materials from a well-known university to jointly develop and innovatively introduce aerospace and advanced military grade material - the best combination of carbon and aramid fibers.  After thousands of experiments, the world's first aramid fiber composite bicycle was created.",
      "Aramid Fiber is usually known as \u201cKevlar\u201d and is used to create body armors, bullet-proof vests, firefighters uniforms, and a world of other critical equipment that spells safety and strength for those who wear it.  Aramid Fiber is used for its excellent strength-to-weight ratio and heat-resistant properties, offering a shield of protection that is nevertheless lean and lightweight, that makes our unique e-bike exactly that: truly unique!",

That\u2019s why your 3V Aramid Fiber Electric Bicycle has a seat tube built with aramid fiber and fork air suspension to provide effective shock absorption and overall improve your riding comfort.

We know that, which is why we made ergonomically designed leather-based handlebars: exceedingly comfortable, charismatically stylish!",

      "We are sold out on Indiegogo but Boxscoop 2.0 and Curve XL are available at theboxscoop.com",
      "The litter box is a real struggle, for all of us. This system will change that but before we explain the intricacies, we would like to tell you how it came to be. From a young age I have been passionate on design, efficiency and simplicity. When I grew up I became an Engineer. Michelle and I are both passionate on fairness and respect for all creatures. The disconnect between integrating the litter box into the household and having it ethical for our cats drove us crazy.",
      "From the start of 2017 through to Oct. 2018 we stood by helplessly watching my sister face an aggressive breast cancer; I coped by spending copious amounts of time fixated on designing a better litter box. We approached it from a completely different angle demanding the utmost efficiency with zero compromise. The vision was to create the perfect synergy between human AND cat needs.",
      "James + Michelle",
      "Boxscoop has modern aesthetics and because your eyes cannot catch the corners (there are none) it appears smaller than it is. It's an illusion... it's not meant for 25 lb cats but it is bigger than a standard litter box and far more ergonomic to the way cats move.",
      "Boxscoop is chore free to maintain, raises next to zero dust, and is designed from cat behavior studies for cat comfort... plus, it's modern and looks nothing like a litter box.",
      "We released our first model in July 2018 and the feedback was incredible. We recorded every detail and consistently analyzed for improvements. Success to us is making the most number of lives better. We brought the first model to market ourselves; we can do infinitely better together with you.",
      "When dealing with pee and poo, the fewer components and seams the better. The container, scoop and cover are all precision made. Ridges and contours are elegantly carved into the surface to allow it to slice through the litter like this. The design looks simple because we over-engineered for simplicity. Creating this sized container with precision in one piece requires a machine capable of pressing the equivalent weight of 330 cars!",
      "The cover on 2.0 is designed to securely fit without any clips, because who wants to fumble with clips every time they go to clean the litter box! It's actually so secure it's essentially dog proof!",
      "5 days and 2.7 minutes total spent on the litter box, including removing/replacing the cover and tossing the waste in another room\u2014 and that's daily cleaning with a 14-15lb cat. This is real life with Boxscoop.",
      "A standard clay litter in a standard litter box with one large cat costs ~US$ 220 per year. Boxscoop is extremely litter efficient and saves hundreds in litter costs:",
      "*Annual costs calculated are approximations based on one large cat (12-15lbs). For full experiment and results, please see our blog post: The cost of cat litter",
      "From surveys, 52% of our backers use clay litter and Boxscoop is ~35% more litter efficient than a standard litter box with clay litter. From the 6000 we've shipped in 2019, that translates to at least 500,000lbs less clay litter being consumed per year. That's a big deal, and with every new Boxscoop 2.0 shipped, the number will keep increasing.",
      "We engineered features into the design to perform even better with alternative clumping litters like corn, grass, walnut, wheat and more. These litters are lighter, healthier for cats, biodegradable and they stay fresher longer, saving you money while saving the environment and your cats health.",
      "This is Boxscoop with a Walnut based litter:",
      "Grass litter compliments almost all other clumping litters, especially clay. It's typically odor and dust free and it clumps and absorbs odors and moisture amazingly well.",
      "If you have a clay litter you love, mixing 30-50% of a grass litter in with the clay will keep the litter fresher and extend its life. It also lightens heavy clays and makes them even easier to scoop!",
      "*Dr. Elsey Ultra and other similar coarse grain clay litters are sludgy and require more scooping force in Boxscoop. If you'd like to use a coarse grain clay, we highly recommend mixing in 30-50% of a grass or walnut litter.",
      "This is Dr.Elsey's Ultra with 50% Grass litter added:",
      "Boxscoop components are 100% recyclable\u2014 and we package without the use of plastic.",
      "We're also currently developing a toss container that will seamless attach to Boxscoop so you can scoop, toss and compostable bag quickly! The toss container holds and dispenses rolls of compostable doggie waste bags.",
      "This accessory will be available for your Boxscoop in April 2020, and as a Boxscoop backer you can pre-order it directly from our site at 67% discount.",
      "Cats have 200 million odor-sensitive cells and it\u2019s our mission to make daily cleaning easy, so your cats have one of their most basic and overlooked needs fulfilled\u2014a clean comfortable place to do their business.",
      "Do you have 20-30 seconds a day? Thirty seconds is \u00bc the time it takes to brush your teeth and the scoop will run through all the litter getting those little nasties out; it's a rewarding feeling and your cats will thank you with extra purrs",
      "Boxscoop 2.0 is recommended for cats up to around 15lbs that are agile and can easily jump up on to a couch. The scoop can also be stored outside, or Boxscoop can be used with the cover off for cats that want a bit of extra room.",
      "Boxscoop Curve XL is available on our website for cats up to 20-21lbs. If you are interested in Curve XL click the link below:",
      "Boxscoop Curve XL",
      "Inside Boxscoop cats can freely turn and the open top gives them visibility to everything around them. They feel safe, secure and always have the option to pounce out if something makes them uneasy.",

      "80% of cats take to Boxscoop like \"ducks to water\" the other 20% require more time. The design works both with and without the cover; this way the skeptic cats can adjust at their own pace.",

      "Boxscoop began with Arthur, a Bengal that started her life being mistaken for a boy. Arthur loved to dig, she was a cat after all!! but she hated being enclosed; Michelle disliked the dinosaur litter box in our closet and I felt the design efficiencies of litter boxes were absurd.",
      "On Feb. 21, 2017 I wrote this:",
      "In July 2018, we released the original Boxscoop. It received incredible feedback but it also could be far improved. It was our first attempt and we funded it ourselves. It was an exciting time we felt we were making a real difference! Then on October 6th, while running around chasing a feather Arthur collapsed. She was only 2.5 years old and completely had our hearts... She had a genetic heart condition called HCM and just like that little Arthur was gone... and then 15 hours later my sister took her last breaths as well.",
      "The easy thing to do would be quit Boxscoop... but this was inspired by Arthur, and encouraged by Kristy. They planted the seed and we are beyond inspired to take Boxscoop to the next level.",

      "There has to be a better way!",
      "Everything seems right and in order in your bag, until the one important day you forget that one crucial piece of equipment. If you\u2019ve ever left home without your mouse, you know how much it can really ruin your day.",

      "That\u2019s how the idea for Magnito was born.",
      "\u201cUse of a laptop computer is associated with constrained poor postures that may contribute to discomfort in the neck, shoulder and arm. Use of an external mouse, compared to the built-in trackpad on a laptop, allows greater flexibility of arm postures with reduced work of some arm muscles. In side-by-side tests, an external mouse is more productive (speed combined with accuracy) than a trackpad. An external mouse should be one of the first steps to improving employee\u2019s daily comfort and performance while using a laptop, whether at home or in the office.\u201d",
      "- David Rempel, MD, MPH (UC Berkeley, San Francisco) and Logitech Scientific Advisory Board member.",

      "iPads, Galaxy Tab, and other tablets actually have up to 50 magnets inside of the device, which are essential for adhesion to their keyboard case and other peripherals. This is because magnetic adhesion is a commonly used technology for tablets, and it is safe for sensitive electronics.",
      "The Magnito Mouse grips onto the magnets inside your tablet, just like a keyboard case or Apple Pencil. And just like these products, Magnito\u2019s magnet won\u2019t cause damage to your tablet.",
      "For laptops too, Magnito\u2019s magnet will not cause damage to your hard drive. But, if you want to be extra safe, just place the Magnito Pad on the back of your laptop\u2019s monitor.",
      "To make sure you never lose your mouse again, our first concern was to make Magnito as adhesive as possible.",
      "That\u2019s why Magnito uses a powerful neodymium magnet, with strength verified through our strict magnetic power testing. Magnito\u2019s galvanized steel cover also maximizes the magnet\u2019s strength for even better adhesion.",

Our productivity suffered greatly without mouses, and touchpads weren\u2019t a perfect substitute, either. That\u2019s when we came up with the idea of attaching a mouse to a tablet, similar to the Apple Pencil. We researched a proper design and structure for a magnetic detachable mouse, and found that a pebble-like design had the best grip.",
      "We then optimized Magnito\u2019s structural design for maximum adhesion, all while sporting a neat appearance. Magnito is built with a Neodymium magnet \u2013 the strongest type of magnet there is \u2013 so it can hold the mouse\u2019s weight with optimal magnetic force.",
      "We added the remote control feature in the prototype test stage. In order to preserve the mouse\u2019s aesthetics, usability, and grip, we developed a switch mode to let you use Magnito as a remote, without having to add any extra buttons.

      "How often do you find yourself staring at a wilting plant, unsure of what went wrong?",
      "Here\u2019s the truth: Even experienced plant owners struggle to keep their plants healthy because plants don\u2019t communicate their needs in a way we understand. Without real data, plant care becomes a frustrating cycle of trial and error, leading to wilted leaves, root rot, and expensive plant deaths.\n\nThis is why professional gardeners and growers don\u2019t rely solely on experience and knowledge\u2014they use plant sensing tools to ensure the best possible care for their plants.",
      "Plant Care should not feel like guesswork. This is why FYTA offers an entire suite of interconnected devices that work together to monitor your plants in real time and  ensure that your plants stay healthy.",
      "Most plant trackers are made for just one type of setup or one plant size \u2014but plants come in all shapes and sizes, grow in different conditions, and need different kinds of care. That\u2019s why FYTA is designed as a modular system. With four different trackers that work together\u2014plus interchangeable probes and different connectivity options\u2014you can customize your setup for any plant, whether indoors, outdoors, in soil, or hydroponics.",
      "The FYTA Mini and FYTA Sphere work as a team: the Mini monitors soil conditions for each plant, while the Sphere tracks the microclimate for all of them.\nThe Sphere features a reorientable dome, allowing you to adjust its angle and accurately capture direct, indirect, and diffused light from multiple directions. This flexibility makes it the perfect tool for optimizing light exposure in any environment.\n\nBoth sensors connect to the FYTA app via Bluetooth or WiFi Hub, giving you real-time insights into exactly what your plants need. If you have many plants in the same location (e.g. grow tent or window sill), this combination is the most budget-friendly option.",
      "Our all-rounders are equipped with the same sensors, but each is designed for a different environment: The Beam (Gen 2) is compact and sleek, ideal for stand-alone indoor plants. The Outdoor Beam is built for tougher conditions\u2014it features a sturdy design, a rechargeable battery, WIFI and (optionally) LTE-M connectivity, ensuring reliable operation even in remote locations. It works great in garden beds and lawns.",
      "Three years ago, we launched our first product, the FYTA Beam. Since then, we\u2019ve produced over 60,000 sensors, helping thousands of plants thrive and their owners take the guesswork out of plant care. But don\u2019t just take our word for it:",
      "Just like a high-end fitness tracker monitors your body\u2019s health beyond just steps, FYTA goes beyond simple tracking \u2014 analyzing real-time data to provide actionable insights and predictions for your plants.",

      "Different plants have different root depths, making it essential to measure soil conditions at the right level to prevent overwatering and root rot. With FYTA, you can choose from probe lengths between 3 and 35 cm, ensuring precise moisture readings exactly where they matter most\u2014whether for potted plants, raised beds, or deep-rooted species.",
      "With your reward, you\u2019ll receive probes of your choice\u2014at no extra cost! This is a special perk, as our probes, which range from 3 to 35 cm in length, typically affect the pricing of our products. \u2728",
      "No need to choose your probes when placing your order! Instead, when it\u2019s time to confirm shipment, we\u2019ll send you a survey where you can select the perfect probe length for your plants.",
      "FYTA sensors connect via Bluetooth (BLE) and, with the optional WiFi Hub, can integrate seamlessly into your smart home setup. No WiFi in your garden? No problem. The FYTA Outdoor Beam connects via LTE-M at no additional cost and acts as a hub for all FYTA devices within BLE range, ensuring reliable monitoring\u2014even in remote locations.",

We will work with you on finding the best solution. If tariffs make delivery to the US unreasonable, you\u2019ll have the option to cancel your order and receive a full refund \u2014 no questions asked. And of course, every product comes with a two-year warranty, including refunds or replacements in case of defects or issues.",
      "We\u2019re a dedicated team of 12 people from Berlin, Germany, combining expertise in hardware, software, data and plant science to create the most advanced plant monitoring system available.",
      "When we launched our first sensor, the FYTA Beam, we didn\u2019t stop there. We continuously refined our hardware, app, and data model\u2014learning from user feedback, fine-tuning our algorithms, and iterating relentlessly to make plant care smarter and more intuitive.",
      "But we also realized that one sensor alone wasn\u2019t enough\u2014there were many use cases the Beam (Gen 1) couldn\u2019t fully cover. That\u2019s why we decided to relaunch FYTA as a complete system of sensors.",
      "In this video, you\u2019ll see one of our hardware developers, Nico, and our founder, Claudia, walk through the current state of our PCBA prototypes (EVT). To keep development efficient and cost-effective, we built all prototypes on the existing Beam form factor, allowing us to test new functions in the most cost-effective manner.Current Status of Our Development Process",
      "\u2022 The Sphere, Mini, Beam Gen 2 already moved intio tooling.",
      "\u2022 We expect to finalize the few outstanding design questions on the Outdoor Beam  shortly and move it to tooling before mid-May.",
      "\u2022 All Bills of Materials\u2014aside from the soil probe\u2014are finalized and have been thoroughly reviewed with our trusted production partner, with whom we\u2019ve been working for over four years.",
      "We aim to move all four new products into tooling and subsequent production trials by mid-May, with certification and setup costs to be covered through our regular revenue. We\u2019re committing to a tight timeline to ensure the products ship before the gardening season winds down. This will take focus, discipline, and long hours\u2014but we\u2019re not new to this. Since launching our first product on Indiegogo four years ago, supply chain management and production execution have become core strengths. On top of that, we\u2019re building on the deep experience of our long-standing, trusted manufacturing partner.",
      "This isn\u2019t just another prototype\u2014it\u2019s a product we\u2019re ready to deliver.",
      "Yes, FYTA is a venture-backed start-up with a growing customer base and steady revenue, but launching four new products at once is a major step that comes with its own challenges.\n\nCrowdfunding allows us to fine-tune our product offerings in real time\u2014helping us answer key questions like which bundles work best, which color do you prefer and what concerns or questions customers have when ordering. This information will ensure a successful launch to market.\n\nBut Indiegogo is also about building a community. Many of our earliest backers from our first campaign in 2020 remain our most loyal customers today, actively shaping FYTA\u2019s evolution. Their feedback has been invaluable in refining our app, product features, and user experience, and some have even become investors along the way.\n\nFor us, crowdfunding isn\u2019t just about launching new products\u2014it\u2019s about co-creating them together with our community and ensuring we\u2019re fully prepared for what\u2019s ahead.",
      "Algorithm Accuracy: For the past two years, we\u2019ve been dedicated to refining and enhancing our plant health algorithms. With our new sensors, we\u2019ll be able to introduce more plant health metrics, expanded app features, and support for a wider range of use cases. Some of these\u2014like lawn care\u2014are uncharted territory for us, so there may be a few bumps along the way.",
      "However, rest assured that we are fully committed to overcoming any challenges that arise. Our track record speaks for itself, and we continuously improve our technology based on real-world feedback. If you ever run into an issue, you can reach us directly through our app or Discord channel, and we\u2019ll be happy to assist you.",
      "Manufacturing: We have established a strong partnership with an experienced contract manufacturer with decades of expertise in electronic product assembly. Over the years, manufacturing and supply chain management have become one of our strengths, and our combined expertise will help ensure a smooth production process.",
      "That said, we still need to navigate the manufacturing prototyping phase, where unforeseen delays can occasionally occur. While we are launching this campaign with full confidence, we remain proactive and prepared to address any production challenges. If delays arise, we will work diligently to minimize them and keep you fully informed every step of the way.",

      "At Nireeka, we are passionate about speed and consistently strive to push the boundaries. With a max speed of 50mph/80kph, the Spectrx is one of the fastest ebikes on the market.",
      "From the first ride, the Spectrx redefines what you expect from an e-bike. Its performance, innovative design, and smooth ride set a new standard. One that\u2019s hard to match and even harder to put down.",

    "company_name": "Piedra Cocinar",
    "allParagraphs": [
      "One of the oldest and healthiest cooking techniques - Stone Cooking returns to our kitchens.",
      "We wanted to make one of the oldest and healthiest cooking techniques - stone cooking - accessible to everyone. So, we created a stone pan with a little modern twist so it could be used anywhere and everywhere - from the heaters to straight on the dining table.",
      "Healthy cooking. Delicious food. Long lasting. Retains heat. Eco-friendly materials. Good presentation. Even better price.",
      "These days, in this fast-paced world, we are always in such a rush. Barely ever do we take the time to ourselves. From high-speed Internet, to fast food, to high-demand everything - we are always rushing through life when we really should be slowing down and enjoying it.",
      "So we, a group of food enthusiasts, teamed up with some of the best chefs in the world to create something that would help solve this problem of rushing. Something that would be your tool in healthy eating. Something that would allow you to use an ancient cooking method at home. Something that would bring the family together. Something that would impress your guests at your next backyard barbeque party. Something that would bring out your inner Betty Crocker even if you\u2019re the worst chef in the world. And most importantly - something that would help you wind down and truly enjoy the food and company surrounding you.",
      "That something is Piedra Cocinar. A stone pan that takes us back to our roots and reminds us to slow down sometimes.",
      "Now, we know what you are thinking\u2026 What? Another cooking pan? Don\u2019t we have enough of those on the market?",
      "Well, this one is different. Isn\u2019t that what they all say, though? But seriously. This pan takes us way back to our roots. 2000 years back. And reminds us to wind down, take our time, and enjoy the moment.",
      "Inspired by Mediterranean cooking and the Mediterranean lifestyle, we believe that every person should take the time to de-stress, slow down, and truly enjoy a home-cooked meal. Whether that would be every day or just once a week - Piedra Cocinar invites you to do that by helping you cook something truly special and keeping it warm for a long time.",
      "It is well known that the Mediterranean diet is perhaps one of the healthiest diets in the world. From fighting inflammation, to reducing the risk for heart attack, stroke & Alzheimer\u2019s disease, to encouraging healthy weight loss, to improving skin health - eating like a Mediterranean has been associated with endless health benefits.",
      "Which is why we teamed up with the well-known chefs and Mediterranean food experts to bring the Piedra Cocinar project to life. Born in the small Spanish towns they continue their family cooking traditions that have been passed on generation to generation for hundreds of years. And their grandparents are living proof of the benefits of eating like a Mediterranean!",
      "Mediterranean chef Santiago  - \u2018\u2019Yes, my grandma is over one hundred years old. She is still in good health and she is a very independent lady. And she still cooks daily. And what is most important - every time we sit around the table for a family dinner, she impresses us with something new. New aroma, new taste,\u2019\u2019 he smiles. \u2018\u2019Most people in our towns can expect to live longer, much longer than the World\u2019s average\u2019\u2019.",
      "Don\u2019t get confused here. The Piedra Cocinar pan is not just another cast iron skillet or non-stick pan. It is something completely different. It\u2019s the thing you knew in the back of your head that your kitchen was missing. And once you try it, you won\u2019t know how you ever lived without it!",
      "Unlike most pans and baking dishes, Piedra Cocinar is created with gabbro diabase (black marble) rather than metal or glass. Due to the thermal mass of the rock and the material's property food is less likely to burn on it.",
      "Not to mention, for the first time in history, our Piedra Cocinar stone pans can be used anywhere and everywhere. It\u2019s stone cooking taken to another level! The only exception - microwaves. But microwaves aren\u2019t good for you anyway, so it\u2019s a win-win.",
      "Even though we would love to take all the credit, we can\u2019t. We didn\u2019t invent stone cooking - our ancestors did. All we did was make it accessible to everyone by creating a stone pan that can be used in any modern kitchen. And, we don\u2019t want to brag, but we think it\u2019s pretty awesome and our ancestors would be proud.",
      "That pretty much says it all. You know, if it was created by chefs - it has to be good.",
      "We are a team of Spanish and UK engineers, chefs, and food lovers. By combining all of our knowledge, we have designed a range of kitchenware so you could become a chef too - the Piedra Cocinar way.",
      "Even if you don\u2019t know how to cook, our team of in-house chefs creates picture-perfect food recipes weekly for you to try at home.",
      "We believe that the best things come from simplicity - fire, stone, and organic groceries. You\u2019d be surprised what a delicious and healthy combination these three components make.",
      "Not to mention, you can cook absolutely anything on Piedra Cocinar kitchenware. Unlike with barbeque grills where your possibilities are limited, food does not dry out on our stone pans. They are specially created to lock in all the healthy juices within the foods.",
      "Not only will your guests be impressed with how good of a chef you are (wink, wink), but they will also be impressed by the presentation as well.",
      "Serve the food straight from a large \u201cshare la plancha\u201d or separate \u201ca piedra para cocinar\u201d for each guest.",
      "Since the stone stays warm for a while, the food will also stay hot and moist. So you can wind down, take your time, and enjoy your meal like a true Mediterranean. No rush!",
      "It\u2019s a well-known fact that overheated or scratched non-stick pans coated by PFOA or PFTE are toxic. In fact, birds die if they inhale PFTE. Humans can survive these intoxications, but the question is - do we want to? Just because we can survive doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not harmful. Just think about it - why buy expensive, organic groceries and toss them on to Perfluorooctanoic/Teflon coated pans? It doesn\u2019t make sense.",
      "We say no to artificial coatings and want to inspire you to do so too. The Piedra Cocinar kitchenware is eco-friendly, 100% recyclable, and artificial coating-free.",
      "Made from gabbro diabase stone, hardwood handles, and lots of love, the Piedra Cocinar kitchenware is completely handmade in the UK. No slavery or kids labour involved in our production run. Just lots of passion and love for high-quality kitchenware, and a lifetime guarantee!",
      "Expect these pans to be extremely long-lasting, as they are loaded with naturally-formed layers of metamorphic stone - which is composed of silt ore, shale, and volcanic ash compressed over millions of years. Not to mention, the hardwood handles are boiled in natural oils to give longevity, strength and to revive natural beauty. The result - a beautiful, eco-friendly, one-of-a-kind stone pan.",
      "Please note this product is made from natural stone and wood, therefore you will find color and pattern variations in the stone and the wood due to the way the product is made. No two items are identical. Each and every item is unique.",
      "We like to believe that local is the new luxury nowadays. Products developed in Third-world countries can be found everywhere and are often bad quality, while handmade items are rarer and made with love.",
      "We believe that a healthy lifestyle should be accessible to everyone. Which is why our kitchenware is honestly priced. No gimmicks. No BS. Just a truly great cooking experience.",
      "In fact, believe it or not, our one-of-a-kind products handmade with love are cheaper than the ones made in developing countries. Pretty crazy, huh? We think so too.",
      "We need your help to buy more productive machinery in order to achieve even better quality products in larger quantities. This machinery, which would help us cut and assemble the Piedra Cocinar cooking stones, would allow us to reduce the prices and make our products even more affordable for everyone. Because when we say we believe everyone should be able to enjoy healthy meals on a daily basis - we mean it!",
      "Make every meal a celebration for your friends and family with Piedra Cocinar!",
      "We have spent days and late evenings perfecting the design and usability, but as usual the most significant risk, as always, is timing. \nSometimes things may go wrong that can\u2019t plan for, but we are ready to face even unplanned challenges and ensure everything within our control and within promised timescale. \nTo minimize the possibility of manufacturing setbacks and to ensure the quality meets our highest standards, we will continue to assemble Piedra Cocinar cooking stone in the UK.",

Most current fire starter solutions on the market are far from perfect\u2014they require separate storage for the striker and ferro rod and often lack versatility. Our mission was to design a \"perfect\" fire starter that addresses aesthetics, sealing, practicality, portability, and ease of access. After relentless effort and meticulous refinement, we are proud to introduce our product\u2014a comprehensive fire starter solution that solves all these issues, packaged in a 12cm long,85g body.",

From survival situations to everyday tasks, this fire starter has you covered, no matter where your adventures take you.",
      "Next, let's dive deeper into the specifics and explore the unique features and craftsmanship that make this product truly stand out.",

      "The design of the SparkX firestarter is exceptionally thoughtful, ensuring both functionality and ease of use.

The exterior features an anti-slip design, ensuring that you can effortlessly remove the firestarter in any condition. Additionally, the container is waterproof, keeping your ignition tools dry and ready for reliable performance in all weather conditions.

      "With this feature, you'll have a reliable fire-starting method at your fingertips, enhancing your outdoor survival capabilities and providing peace of mind in challenging environments.",
      "The SparkX also features a mini knife, adding a crucial element of versatility to this all-in-one tool.

      "Unlike typical hidden mini knives with fixed blades, the SparkX features an interchangeable blade design. We prioritized this in our design to ensure that your knife remains sharp and practical over time. The replaceable blades not only maintain optimal sharpness but also enhance the overall utility of the tool.",
      "Switching out the blade is effortless with our quick-release system. Easily remove and replace the blade without any special tools, ensuring that you always have a sharp and ready knife when you need it.",
      "Additionally, these blades are incredibly cost-effective, making replacements easy on your wallet.

      "While we thought of going the crowdfunding road with SPT 1.0, we didn\u2019t want to rush with a product that\u2019s even one step away from perfect. We wanted to present a product that had been already tested on-ground.",

We contemplated size, shape, battery life, but most importantly ease of use. A single button to start and stop recording and a lock to prevent pocket dials. Everyone should be able to use this without investing in learning. It needed to be familiar and have features that gives the user feedback. Integrating AI was the breakthrough we needed, transforming CRUSH from a simple recorder into an intelligent assistant. We redesigned from the ground up three times all of the as we learned about all of the use cases that evolved.",
      "Developing CRUSH has not been easy. Hardware is notoriously difficult, and the iOS, Android, and Web app added layers of complexity. Getting everything to talk reliably is not easy. We have had to overcome hard engineering problems, learn new skills, and rewrite the entire codebase from scratch when we learned into what CRUSH would become and who would be using it. There is a reason why CRUSH has not existed before, it's complex and expensive. That only encouraged us.",

      "Cubiio X tackles projects larger than its size. Four steel cord timing belts with varying lengths provide a configurable workspace of up to 4 ft by 4 ft or 2 ft by 6 ft. This compact machine makes it possible to create a 4-seat table or even a Christmas tree with ease.",
      "Cubiio X cuts through a variety of materials such as wood, plastic and metal. Its solid rail and precision ballscrew guide the spindle, while the z-axis motor gradually actuates the spinning bit into the workpiece. Actual tests show that Cubiio X is capable of reliably machining aluminum, copper, and brass using carbide bits.",
      "Cubiio X can cut materials on a 4\u2019 x 4\u2019 area at up to a 1.2\u201d depth. Perfect for hobbyists and pros. With minimal setup and maximum repeatability, you can start carving artwork as you want. Nice and clean! So, what masterpiece will you create first? A chair, a guitar, an airplane?",
      "With a V-shape carving bit, Cubiio X is capable of carving 3D relief. See the beautiful details.",
      "4 independent motors manage belts that precisely guide the tool throughout the machining process. The tension of the belts is constantly monitored and adjusted to ensure optimal speed and accuracy, taking into account factors such as friction, reaction torque, and belt elasticity. The advanced mathematics behind Cubiio X's design sets it apart, ensuring exceptional performance every time.",

      "You can trust a campaigner with a proven track record. We completed 2 million-dollar-level Kickstarter campaigns and fulfilled all 5000 orders. Now we have rich experience in mass production, logistics, and customer service. We are confident that all backers will receive their rewards before November. However, unforeseen conditions might arise which may cause delays. If anything unpredictable happens, we will keep backers informed as we try our best to solve the problem. Any cutting machine has the risk of being harmful to the human body. Wear protective equipment properly. Any laser device has the risk of being harmful to the human eye and skin. Never direct powered laser products toward humans, creatures, explosives, and flammable objects. Rewards provided by this project are not allowed to be used in any illegal purpose. Obey the law and comply with the laser safety regulations of your country.",

      "Have you ever been caught in an outdoor adventure, needing to adjust a loose screw on your gadget or tool, but found yourself stuck because you didn't have a screwdriver on hand?",
      "If your answer is yes, then you've come to the right campaign.",
      "That\u2019s exactly why we designed this titanium and brass lanyard bead. Traditional lanyard beads add style and improve grip, but our bead takes it a step further by incorporating a hidden bit driver. Now, with this lanyard bead, you can always have a screwdriver ready when you need it most. It\u2019s practical in everyday life, and to make it even more versatile, we've designed it to be worn in various ways\u2014on a keychain, as a necklace, or attached to your tools. Plus, with four tritium slots, it\u2019s easy to find even in the dark.",
      "Crafted to be more than just an accessory, this lanyard bead is your reliable everyday tool. Compact yet incredibly versatile, it's designed to go wherever life takes you, ensuring you're always prepared for any task, big or small. Whether you\u2019re making quick repairs, navigating your day, or simply enjoying its aesthetic appeal, this bead effortlessly combines form and function in one sleek design.",
      "With an overall length of 3.8cm (1.5in) and a diameter of 1.4cm (0.6in), it\u2019s small enough to carry without adding bulk, yet robust enough to handle everyday challenges. Whether it\u2019s on your keychain, necklace, or attached to your tools, this bead is the perfect companion for on-the-go utility and style.",
      "Elevate your everyday style by wearing it as a pendant. Not only does it add a unique, rugged touch to your outfit, but it also ensures you have a hidden tool at hand, ready to tackle any quick fix, no matter where you are.",
      "Attach it to your keychain for instant access to a screwdriver when you need it most. This compact bead blends seamlessly with your keys, serving as both a practical tool and a stylish statement piece that\u2019s always within reach.",
      "Hang it on your favorite tool for added grip and style. Whether you're working in the garage or out in the field, this bead complements your gear while providing extra functionality when needed.",
      "Our design journey began with the vision of creating a lanyard bead that\u2019s not only visually striking but also highly functional. But how does this vison came up?",
      "Our team is made up of passionate EDC (Everyday Carry) enthusiasts, and we own over a hundred different utility knives. However, we noticed a recurring inconvenience: whenever we wanted to disassemble a knife, it often took ages to find a screwdriver.",
      "One day, a team member suggested that the standard knife beads are usually just decorative and provide grip. What if we could transform that bead into a functional screwdriver? That idea sparked the journey of designing this product.",
      "It may seem like a simple concept, but integrating functionality into such a small size while ensuring that it is genuinely useful is no easy feat. After numerous iterations and refinements, we are proud to introduce the ScrewMaster.",
      "This product truly addresses common challenges faced by outdoor enthusiasts and EDC fans alike. We invite you to watch the animation below to experience the incredible capabilities of the ScrewMaster for yourself!",
      "We selected GR5 Titanium for its exceptional strength-to-weight ratio, outstanding corrosion resistance, and long-lasting durability. This high-performance material is built to endure the rigors of everyday use and harsh environments, making it the ideal choice for a tool designed to be your reliable companion.",
      "The addition of brass not only enhances the bead\u2019s aesthetic appeal but also provides an elegant contrast to the titanium, elevating the overall design with a refined touch.",
      "One of the standout features of the ScrewMaster Lanyard Bead is its remarkable durability due to crafted from premium titanium alloy and brass, this product is not just designed to impress\u2014it's built to withstand the test of time. You can confidently say the ScrewMaster is crush resistant!",
      "To showcase its incredible strength, we invite you to watch the animation below, where a massive SUV rolls right over the ScrewMaster. The result? Absolutely unscathed! This rugged accessory is truly made to last, proving that not only can it withstand pressure, but it can also handle the toughest of adventures without missing a beat.",
      "The bead is meticulously designed to fit a 1/4-inch bit, offering remarkable versatility for a range of tasks. Given the compact space available in the lanyard bead, we had to optimize for a single bit size, and the 1/4-inch was the clear choice.",
      "This size covers an extensive variety of bit types, making it ideal for everything from assembling large furniture pieces to fine-tuning delicate items like watches. Its adaptability ensures that no matter the task, you\u2019ll have the right tool on hand.",
      "Additionally, the bit is securely stored inside the bead using a magnetic connection, allowing for quick and easy access when needed, without compromising on the sleek design. Whether you\u2019re handling everyday repairs or unexpected fixes, this compact solution ensures you're always prepared.",
      "The magnetic bit holder enables effortless bit changes, making the tool exceptionally easy to use. The secure magnetic cap ensures that your bits are safely stored inside the bead while remaining easily accessible whenever you need them. This seamless magnetic system not only adds to the convenience but also enhances the overall user experience by combining functionality with secure storage.",
      "After all that talk about durability and functionality, you might be wondering: \"What if I need to use the ScrewMaster, but it's a hassle to remove it from my keychain?\" Well, we\u2019ve got you covered!",
      "In our design process, we anticipated this concern. With just a gentle twist, the ScrewMaster can be effortlessly detached from your keychain. No more fumbling or frustration\u2014it's always ready when you need it. This thoughtful quick release design ensures that whether you're tackling a project or simply enjoying the great outdoors, your ScrewMaster is right there with you, ready to spring into action at a moment's notice!",
      "This versatile tool extends beyond simple repairs, proving indispensable for everyday tasks. Whether you need to open packages, pry out nails, or even pop open a bottle, it serves as a practical companion ready to assist whenever the moment calls.",
      "In emergencies, the glass breaker transforms into an essential lifesaving tool. Designed to quickly and efficiently shatter windows, it provides a vital means of escape from perilous situations such as car accidents or building fires. Its durable construction ensures that even under pressure, you can rely on it to perform effectively, giving you the confidence and peace of mind needed in critical moments. Whether in a vehicle or indoors, this tool is built to help you make a safe and swift exit when every second counts.",
      "The ScrewMaster features four tritium slots strategically placed around its circumference, transforming this pendant into more than just a multifunctional tool pendant; it becomes a beautiful keychain lantern. This design ensures you can easily identify your belongings in the dark. Whether you desire enhanced visibility or a unique personal touch, you can select the color that best suits your style and needs.",
      "The innovative magnetic design not only serves as a functional accessory but also doubles as an engaging fidget toy. It provides a satisfying tactile experience, making it perfect for moments when you need a little distraction. Whether you're dealing with boredom or stress, the smooth spin of the magnets offers an enjoyable and calming way to relieve tension and pass the time.

      "All of our reward tiers offer the same high-quality pendant made from Gr5 titanium and brass, along with a complimentary paracord. The paracord makes it easy for you to attach the lanyard bead to your knife or tools. If you prefer to wear it as a necklace pendant or attach it to your keys, you can find suitable accessories in the add-on section.",
      "If you\u2019re looking to further personalize your pendant, explore our add-on options, which include items like a necklace, D-ring, tritium tubes, glow tubes, or engraving services. Tritium tubes provide a continuous glow without needing a charge, while glow tubes require exposure to light to illuminate. This flexibility allows you to customize your reward to fit your style and preferences.",
      "Below is a timeline detailing the significant milestones we've reached, including the birth of our idea, market research, CAD modeling, extensive testing and revisions, finalizing the product design, and preparing our campaign page. Each step reflects our dedication and hard work. We plan to launch in October, begin production in November, and finalize preparations, quality checks, and pre-shipping arrangements in January.

      "We can also offer the best advice for those about to go to university for the first time.",
      "Your contributions can help turn this service into a major provider of help to the thousands of History undergraduates who struggle with Uni demands in their first year.",

      "If we are unable to reach our total goal, do not fear! Your perks will remain valid and we will use any monies raised to help us get off the ground.",
      "However, if you do help us to reach our goal we can take that extra step in reaching as many students as possible and becoming a major provider of their needs.",
      "Every year, thousands of History students find the step up from school to university difficult to manage.",
      "This is particularly true for working-class students, whose parents and schools are often unable to provide the kinds of support wealthier students take for granted.",
      "Many will feel their dreams of university life have turned into a nightmare and drop out.",
      "But it doesn't have to be like this!",
      "History Skills UK can provide help with basic skills that over-worked tutors have no time to provide. We have the space to deliver one-to-one advice and knowledge. And we can offer the kind of practical advice students really need.",
      "Sure, there are many expensive study guides and hard-to-read textbooks out there - a whole industry feeding off students and worried parents.",
      "By contrast, we can provide useful advice specifically tailored to the individual needs of students. And we won't charge the earth to provide that service.",
      "In most cases solutions can quickly be found to the difficulties History undergraduates face. And with a little help and the right kind of encouragement, students can find their feet and be back on track in no time at all.",
      "It just needs an experienced hand, willing to spend some time providing advice specifically tailored to the needs of the individual student.",
      "We can provide precisely that service.",

      "My record speaks for itself. I have studied and taught at a wide variety of institutions - from the University of St Andrews to Edge Hill and even the Open University.",
      "I received no help from parents and schools and had limited resources. I learned the hard way how to succeed at university. I also made many mistakes! I can draw on both my successes and failures to point the next crop of History students in the right direction.",
      "There are always risks with challenges like these. We are currently a small-scale organisation and we operate during a climate of uncertainty that affects universities all over the UK. We will have to be flexible and constantly plugged in to the problems faced by both students and the institutions they study at.",
      "But, as I have demonstrated time and time again, lack of resources and widespread uncertainty do not have to be a barrier to excellence.",
      "With your support, we will help students reach their potential.",

      "What\u2019s on your chopping boards and plates? Share the leftovers with soilkind. It can handle any kind of organic waste.",
      "We knew there had to be a better solution. We wanted to create a smart device that was just as good as a compost pile, but faster, more comfortable to use, hygienic, and without any unpleasant odors. More than two years of research and testing led us to the perfect solution with our unique and patent-pending technology.",
      "We are the only ones who offer a complete solution. Other products promise to create \u201cfertilizer\u201d - but they really only just dry and grind up waste with no biological decomposition. This output can grow mold, is not nutritious to plants, and can actually be harmful. That\u2019s why only soilkind compost is king!",
      "There is no compost fairy. soilkind impresses with its own magic: an innovative, fully automatic technology with lots of sensors inside. Three simple steps and 48 hours is all it takes for your organic waste to turn into real nourishing compost.",
      "Step 1: Fill soilkind with your food scraps. Are you a real foodie? No worries, soilkind is designed to handle the weekly organic waste volume of a typical four-person family (appx. 2 cycles of 10 liters). Our robust shredding system processes and dries almost everything, even nutshells, and small bones!",
      "As a nice side effect, this leads to a volume reduction of 85%. When enough material accumulates, soilkind automatically processes it to the composting chamber. No odors or fruit flies \u2014 just your excitement for fresh compost.",
      "Step 2: The composting chamber of soilkind is full of sensors and has an intelligent control system. A perfect combination of temperature, humidity, and aeration wakes up the natural microorganisms inside the organic material and turns it into a land of milk and honey that accelerates the microorganisms\u2019 metabolism. soilkind substantially reduces composting time from several months to just 48 hours.",
      "Step 3: The result? Ready-to-use compost for all your plants and flowers \u2014 indoor and outdoor. Your plants will love it since only compost contains such a full spectrum of essential plant nutrients. And if you don\u2019t need all your compost at once, no worries, your soilkind compost can be stored for up to two years.",
      "Plants are living beings, and like us, they need nutrients to grow and stay healthy. So treating them with compost should be on your regular plant routine list. But be careful. In some cases, using dried organic waste (often referred to as \"fertilizer\") can also cause mold and inhibit plant growth. And no plant parent wants this. Right? soilkind compost is so rich in nutrients that it can be mixed in a 1:10 ratio. This means 1 part of soilkind compost with 10 parts of soil.",
      "Garden compost is the most natural way to dispose of organic waste. If managed carefully, it leads to already matured compost. However, this takes a whole lot of time and especially cooked food shouldn't be treated this way since it attracts vermin.",
      "soilkind transforms the majority of compounds in your food scraps like sugar, starch, and proteins. These are broken down within 48h to fresh compost. If mixed with earth, fresh compost gives an immediate boost to your plants and realizes its nutritional potential.",
      "Food waste dryers do only one thing: shredding and drying food. There is no biological decomposition process involved. The organic compounds in this waste are thus inaccessible to plants.",
      "STEP 1: REMINERALIZATION",
      "Your organic waste is a bit like a fresh and full shopping bag. In order for your plants to use the nutrients, the \"bag\" must first be unpacked. This unpacking is called remineralization.",
      "During the remineralization process, organic molecules are converted into inorganic minerals. This conversion is done by omnipresent microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi, which are a natural part of our food.",
      "STEP 2: COMPOSTING",
      "During composting, the main components of organic waste (sugars, starch, proteins, fats, and at a later stage, cellulose) are broken down.",
      "The compost quality and the conversion time can be influenced by providing optimal metabolic conditions for the microorganisms over a certain period of time. These conditions include temperature, pH value, moisture, amount of oxygen, and surface area. The better the conditions are met, the faster high-quality compost is achieved.",
      "Combining the latest technology with the superpowers of natural microorganisms - that\u2019s the essence of soilkind. All of this happens inside our fully automatic kitchen composter in only 48 hours.",
      "Did you know that incorrectly disposed organic waste is not only a wasted resource but is also more dangerous for the climate than CO2?",
      "When organic waste is dumped in a landfill, it undergoes anaerobic decomposition (because of the lack of oxygen) and generates methane gas. Methane gas is a potent greenhouse gas \u2014 about 28 times more harmful than carbon dioxide at warming the earth, on a 100-year timescale, and more than 80 times more powerful over 20 years.",
      "Due to a lack of convenient and clean waste disposal techniques, a significant amount of organic waste is sent to landfills - even in the most developed countries.",
      "This is one of the main reasons why we want to revolutionize your daily organic waste routine.",
      "Bogs represent an important \u201ccarbon sink\u201d \u2013 a place where CO2 is stored below ground and can't escape into the atmosphere and increase global warming. They only cover 3 % of the earth's surface but store about 30% of global CO2. One hectare of the bog with a 15-centimeter thick peat layer contains about as much carbon as a hundred-year-old forest in the same area. That\u2019s amazing! But bogs are in danger. In many places, they are extracted to produce peat, which is then used to enrich potting soil. The protection of bogs is an incredibly important part of climate protection, that is very close to our hearts at soilkind. Therefore we chose to support an NGO which is committed to the protection of bogs. Also, your homemade compost leads to bog protection. With soilkind you can always use peat-free soil because our compost airs the soil and provides it with enough nutrients. The mixing ratio is 1 to 10. 1 part soilkind compost and 10 parts peat-free potting soil.",
      "Give your indoor plants a green booster or nourish your veggies outside. There are so many ways to spread some compost love.",
      "soilkind was founded in 2017. Since day one, our mission has been to create a long-lasting product that combines our digital lifestyle with design and sustainability. Many steps have been mastered during this time including several prototypes, endless compost testing, and cooperation with leading research institutes.",
      "After many tests and trials, the 4th generation prototype was created. Here is an unedited glimpse of the magic behind the machine:",
      "A smart home that feels completely natural \u2013 that\u2019s the challenge of digital devices today. We have created soilkind's design to integrate our kitchen composter stylishly and organically into everyday kitchen routines. Puristic, beautiful, practical, and easy to use.",
      "soilkind is as unique as your food scraps. Keep everything in focus and learn more:",
      "We have been working towards this day for more than two years. Now that we have a fully functional prototype that completely meets our requirements, we are on our way to start serial production. With your help, we can save the world from incorrectly disposed organic waste by giving every household the power to create its own compost.",
      "BY NOW WE HAVE:",
      "WITH YOUR HELP WE WILL:",
      "We are a passionate team of material scientists, engineers, and hobby gardeners located in Stuttgart, Germany. Our mission is to develop innovative solutions that increase the convenience of handling food waste at home while improving sustainability.",

      "Minimalist outside. Over-engineered inside. Built to brew clean, balanced, and consistent coffee.",
      "The dripper project began three years ago with an ambitious goal: to design the world\u2019s first flat-bottom dripper that merges fluid dynamics, design principles, and mechanical engineering.",
      "The end result \u2014 aesthetically simple, mechanically over-engineered, and experientially optimized to bring out unrealized flavour notes from coffee.",
      "We are a research studio focused on documenting ordinary moments.",
      "We believe the intentional act of brewing pour-over coffee is a meaningful daily reminder to make space and savour ordinary moments. From selecting lightly roasted beans, smelling them as you open the bag, making mental connections to the flavour notes on the packaging, imagining how fine or coarse to grind, to taking that first sip, each step invites presence.",
      "Within this process, we noticed that the dripper is the object that ends up being the most visually prominent, the one we look at the longest. This observation led us to a new design philosophy around what a dripper should be, and what it can become.",
      "So, we designed a dripper that remains quietly in the background and unobtrusive instead of trying to be the main character. We want users to focus on the aroma of the coffee, the sound of water pouring over the coffee bed, and the flow of the brewing ritual that leads to that first sip.",
      "Aesthetically simple, mechanically over-engineered, and experientially optimized to bring out unrealized flavor notes \u2014 these qualities are the byproduct of our serendipitous encounter with a product design studio called over_engineered.",
      "Three years ago, during the research phase of this project, we had both qualitative and quantitative data on what makes a good flat-bottom dripper \u2014 yet we struggled to translate that data into a tangible product. After going through our V1 and V2 prototypes, we hit a wall due to conflicting design philosophies and manufacturing complications. Thanks to our new partner, over_engineered, we were finally able to define and visualize what \u201cjust enough\u201d looks like for our dripper \u2014 grounded in research, and made real through design.",
      "Our Yeoyu Dripper is made of 304 stainless steel for sustainability, features an airtight double wall for thermal mass, an optimized diameter for aroma, and a sandblasted finish for a smooth yet matte tactile experience.",
      "We look at innovation in two different ways. One approach is to create something entirely new that has never existed before. The other is to improve an existing product and create a subsegment within a mature category.",
      "We chose the latter. Together with the over_engineered team, we developed a new interchangeable puck system that minimizes clogging and distributes extracted coffee through multiple channels, resulting in a \u2018just right\u2019 flow rate. Our focus on the post-percolation process, pushing extracted coffee through a puck, opened up new possibilities for flavor articulation.",
      "During our usability research phase, we found that we needed three specific components to further improve the user experience of our coffee dripper: a silicone gasket to hold the puck in a snug fit, a silicone bottom pad to protect the carafe from direct contact with stainless steel, and a polycarbonate saucer to ensure a global fit with most carafes on the market.",
      "Throughout our research, we tested different types of flat-bottom paper filters. We designed the dripper to be compatible with the Kalita Wave 185 filter, SIBARIST flat filter, April filter, and Origami Wave filter.",
      "While it was designed in Vancouver, the idea was dreamt in Seoul, encouraged in Berlin, inspired in Kyoto, and confirmed in Copenhagen.",
      "Together with Yeoyu and the over_engineered team, we are Canadians living in a beautiful city called Vancouver, with roots that trace back to South Korea, Japan, and China. It was important for us to acknowledge that and reflect it in our dripper, a reminder that good design is a shared language. For us, it\u2019s more than just a dripper.",
      "It takes a village to bring something from zero to one. I\u2019m sure many folks we came across throughout this product research and development journey might not know how helpful it was to hear a word of encouragement and genuine feedback. Hoping more folks know how much we are grateful for their help, here is the list of people we\u2019re thankful for and their contributions.",

      "Bringing Firefly to life has been a journey filled with innovation, iteration, and real-world problem-solving. From early prototypes to near-final production-ready models, our team tackled major engineering challenges to ensure a reliable, lightweight, and scalable product.",
      "In the early stages, we used AWG28 wires to connect the electronic components inside Firefly. This required manual soldering, which introduced a significant failure rate \u2014 nearly 50% of the prototypes showed glitches or poor connections. The wires would often come loose, and the folding mechanism added mechanical stress that made the system unreliable.\nTo solve this, we redesigned the internal structure to eliminate vulnerable wiring connections while preserving a stable and compact energy system.",
      "Firefly was designed with a folding feature to allow for compact packaging. Initial prototypes used miniature hinges with screws and nuts, which caused several assembly issues: poor screwing, broken plastic parts, and frequent nut loss. This approach was not scalable for mass production.\nWe overcame this by designing a custom plastic-injected hinge, completely removing the need for screws and dramatically improving the product's manufacturability and reliability.",
      "As we transitioned from prototype to production-ready, one of the toughest challenges we faced was scalability. What worked well in a handmade, one-off prototype didn\u2019t always translate smoothly to an efficient, repeatable process on a larger scale. Small imperfections, like minor asymmetries in 3D-printed parts or subtle misalignments during manual assembly, revealed just how sensitive the design was to production variables.",
      "To prepare Firefly for mass manufacturing, we had to redesign several internal components, simplify the assembly flow, and reduce the number of manual steps. We also invested in custom tooling and collaborated closely with manufacturers to ensure that tolerances, materials, and assembly logistics were feasible at volume \u2014 all without compromising the original concept or user experience.",
      "In short, making a product that works once is hard. Making one that works thousands of times, reliably and affordably, is a whole different challenge \u2014 but one we\u2019re proud to have tackled head-on.",
      "Firefly integrates a wide range of technical disciplines, each of which required dedicated development cycles. After five full iterations, we achieved the current design \u2014 a balanced blend of functionality, safety, and manufacturability.",
      "Our goal was to design an intuitive signaling system that required no external remote \u2014 just the user's natural head movement. This had to be simple enough for a child to understand and use, yet advanced enough to be trusted by any commuter.\nKey electronic components include:",
      "Each of these components was chosen to support a reliable, hands-free experience, keeping the rider's attention where it belongs \u2014 on the road.",
      "The development of Firefly\u2019s housing was one of the most intensive parts of the process. We needed the shell to be lightweight, aerodynamic, shock-absorbing, recyclable, and suitable for mass production.\nAfter extensive material testing, we selected:",
      "The housing geometry was refined to accommodate helmet curvature, maintain user comfort, and enclose all electronics in a protected, hollow internal structure. Every curve, thickness, and junction was considered to balance strength and usability.",
      "Though Firefly is mounted at the back of a helmet, it plays a crucial aerodynamic role. The device wraps partially around the helmet to enable 180\u00ba visibility, so its shape had to be engineered to minimize drag and avoid disrupting balance.\nAdditionally, the surface geometry was developed to prevent water accumulation, which could otherwise compromise electronic performance.\nAs a final design decision, we chose to split the side \u201cwings\u201d of Firefly for manufacturing and assembly efficiency. This decision, however, brought renewed attention to water-repellency \u2014 addressed through the selection of specialized plastics in those exposed areas.",
      "After extensive prototyping, testing, and refinement, Firefly is ready \u2014 but to move from a working prototype to full-scale production, we need your help. Your support will allow us to kickstart manufacturing, invest in production tooling, secure high-quality materials, and meet minimum order quantities. By backing this campaign, you\u2019re not just pre-ordering a product \u2014 you\u2019re helping us bring Firefly to life and make urban mobility safer for everyone.",
      "We stand by the quality and reliability of Firefly. That\u2019s why every unit comes with a 2-year limited warranty from the date of delivery.\n\nThis warranty covers:",
      "What\u2019s not covered:",
      "If you experience any issues, our support team is here to help. We will repair or replace your Firefly unit free of charge within the warranty period, subject to a quick evaluation.",

      "1. Riding position",
      "The chin strap is placed in a way that allows you to drink & fully surrounds the face for shock protection.",
      "2. Shock from below",
      "The helmet lifts up from the back and the face shield protects the face. The forehead remains protected by the shell.",
      "3. Shock from above",
      "The helmet pivots forward and lower the chin bar. The face stays protected and the fitting system reduces the helmet move.",
      "Bicycle helmets are designed to meet two important needs of cyclists. Firstly, they provide necessary protection against potential injuries, and secondly, they are designed to be lightweight to avoid interfering with the physical efforts of the rider. With the addition of facial protection that doesn't add unnecessary weight, the VIRGO helmet provides improved safety for the lower part of the face, without compromising on the cyclist's performance.",
      "The VIRGO adopts a hybrid helmet format that combines the best of full-face and open-face helmets to offer the perfect balance of weight and safety. With a reduced weight of just 650 grams, the helmet provides full-face protection while ensuring exceptional comfort throughout your ride.",
      "When we released a draft version of our project, we received feedback from cyclists and doctors across multiple countries. The level of interest varied depending on the individual experiences and practices of each cyclist, as well as the input from doctors who had treated injuries resulting from cycling accidents. This diverse feedback allowed us to gain a deeper understanding of the needs and concerns of cyclists and doctors in different regions, helping us to refine our project to better meet their needs.",
      "After the campaign ends we will process everything quickly and professionally. You will receive a survey. We are able to offer a proven and well-priced solution for worldwide shipment. Your rewards will be sent as parcel \u2013 insured & trackable. Please keep in mind that you may be responsible for customs charges if required by your country for importing goods.",

      "... our most sharp and durable Damascus knife series we have ever made.",
      "Germanicum Arminius is the result of hundreds of hours in refinement of Damascus forging techniques, refinement of production technologies and design improvements on every level.",
      "Our team of dedicated engineers, black smiths and designers put all their passion into this new series of Damascus knives and today we are proud to share these beautiful new knives with you.",
      "Sternsteiger started its own production of Damascus knives back in 2015 and the companies passion for tradition and technology since then has driven the company to new innovations.",
      "Our engineers did not limit themselves to Damascus knives and brought beautiful knives like the popular Sternsteiger Titanium and Achilles Series to market. These endeavors not only helped us to understand the needs of our customers, but also provided us with the experience to improve on our original classic Damascus knife design.",
      "In case you are interested to learn more about the development process of Germanicum Arminius scroll down to the development section, but let us focus for now on what we have improved based upon our original VG10 series below.",
      "We completely re-engineered the finger-guard and bolster tip section of the knife in order to shorten the distance between handle and blade. This much more compact design results into a higher degree of control over the blade.",
      "For more pressure point and grip, a new added Bolster has been added below.",
      "The new bolster is made of the same Damascus steel and is held in place with two brass pins that are polished in a way that they optically merge with the steel.",
      "The new blade is overall more straight than the old design. On the picture below you can see how the old blade falls off towards the edge, while our new blade offers an almost straight surface.",
      "The tapered shape of the old blade makes the knife very stable, but also inflexible. The new flatter shape gives the blade more flexibility and thanks to the new steel we don't lose anything in terms of durability.",
      "In addition the new blade has been straightened with a slightly more curved belly while adding some width in the middle of the blade, providing a greater surface area for improved cuts.",
      "The biggest difference between the two series is the steel which now consists of 440 instead of 67 layers of steel. This increased amount of steel layers gives the blade much more rigidity and therefore increases the durability and lifetime of the blade.",
      "In addition the blade itself becomes a piece of art. Our black smiths have become very creative in regards to possible patterns that can be forged into the blade and therefore making each blade a unique master piece.",
      "The prominient but important feature is this handle, its made up of pure wallnut wood, as compared to our VG-10 series, which has an Micarta handle.",
      "The handle is finished by a pure Damascus cap which compared to the basic stainless steel cap from the VG-10 series gives these knives an even better look and durability.",
      "The old VG-10 series had an Oval shaped bigger Cap, where as the new Arminius series has an Egg shaped oval Damascus forged cap with a pin.",
      "The handle diameter has been trimmed making the Arminius handle thinner -tubular and easier to hold even for smaller hands.",
      "The same applies to the new handle cap as explained above.",
      "The Arminius series has different blade serrations for cutting bread.",
      "Even the Tip of the Arminius bread knife has been changed below ( continous form) below.",
      "The handle features the same updated characteristics like the brass pins and the red leather ring inlays with an added U sahped or V shaped forged Bolster below.",
      "The exciting striking feature of the new Arminius Series is its completely hand-made forging production as compared to the mechnical industrial production of our old VG-10 series.",
      "Since the carbon content is more in the Arminius series, its non stainless steel and have an increased tendency to oxidation process, which is a standard normal behaviour of all original historical hand forged damascus forge.",
      "Arminius Series is an inspired historical handmade forging process as compared to our old VG-10 series which is actually done via closed die forging or impression die forging. Our bladesmiths have used same old age forging methods to have this unique series for you.",
      "Damascus Steel & great warriors in history.",
      "It is been said that the great ancient warriors loved the damascus weaponary originated from the city of Damascus ( modern day Syria ). In those days, the damascus forgeing steel was forged with bringing the steel into a wootz form.",
      "Our team has been trying to forge a knife that has the unique combination of finest elements of steel & wood. For this reason, we included the 440 layers of damascus & the wallnut wooden handles for Arminius damascus Series.",

      "Solid wood pieces, wooden board and the most advanced features from the chess world.",
      "If you love chess, you enjoy the little details of a well-crafted physical set, like the beautiful weighted pieces and natural wood details.",
      "Online chess is definitely convenient and offers possibilities that a physical board just can't. However, playing on a screen will never give you the same experience, and it completely diminishes the beauty of the game.",
      "We bring you the best of both worlds: the infinite possibilities of online chess and the enriching experience of a physical set.",
      "Introducing Phantom. The most advanced chess board in the world.",
      "Phantom is elegantly crafted in natural wood, with the attention to detail chess deserves. But what really makes it extraordinary is inside.",
      "To make the best autonomous chess set in the world, we created a sophisticated sensor array that detects the precise location of every piece and a fast, silent mechanism that moves the pieces smoothly across the board, like magic, for the most amazing chess experience you will ever have.",
      "Phantom allows you to enjoy a real, physical chess game against anyone, anywhere.",
      "Whether it is someone on the other side of the world or a friend or family member you haven\u2019t been able to see for a year, Phantom brings you together.",
      "When you play against someone online, their moves happen in real-time on your board as if they were in the same room. And they don't even need to have a Phantom. They can play with you using their smartphone or computer, but if they use their own Phantom board, the experience becomes magical, as your moves reflect in their board in real time, too.",
      "Direct your troops in battle with fast, responsive voice commands. Like coming out of a magic story, the pieces move autonomously as if enchanted. Marvel anyone by playing a hands-free chess game.",
      "Computers have brought new life to the ancient game of chess. It was once thought impossible that a machine would be able to beat a Grand Master human player. But now, computers have become so good that trying to compete against them is a futile endeavor.",
      "Phantom allows you to play against Maia, a human-like neural network chess engine, specifically designed to mimic human play. It automatically adapts to your rank and always presents you the most challenging and enjoyable game.",
      "Of course, you can also play against other popular engines like Stockfish at different levels and even integrate your own.",
      "Perfect your skills with the Phantom Tutor: your personal trainer. It remembers your every move and gives you precise recommendations on how to improve.",
      "Streaming the Brandenburg Concertos on your phone will never be as exciting as watching the orchestra perform them live. The same is true with chess.",
      "Master games deserve to be enjoyed over and over again.",
      "In Sculpture Mode, Phantom plays back the most iconic games in history autonomously. Choose one from our curated library of 100+ games or upload your own. You can also record your own games and entertain your guests by replaying your greatest matches.",
      "Chess is not just a board game to be put away when you\u2019re done. Chess is art and should be treated as such.",
      "We designed the Phantom set to be the focal point of any room. Phantom is an elegant, timeless collectors' piece that honors the beauty of the game and immediately grabs the attention of anyone who passes by.",
      "Built with high-quality materials and attention to the very last detail, Phantom is a mesmerizing kinetic sculpture to contemplate for hours and proudly display your passion for chess.",
      "We designed Phantom to be enjoyed by novices and professionals alike. Phantom is the perfect gift for any chess lover at any skill level.",
      "THE MINIMAL",
      "Designed to preserve the essence of classic and timeless chess with a modern twist.",
      "The pieces have a minimalist expression yet are easily recognizable.",
      "Ideal to complement any modern space",
      "THE CLASSICAL",
      "Without a doubt, the most recognizable style, the Staunton chess set has been loved for over 150 years. We didn\u2019t want to miss the opportunity to bring this traditional design into the 21st century.",
      "It is ideal to complement any home library, private study, or office.",
      "Expert players are renowned for their graceful moves. Precise. Without hesitations.",
      "But so far, automatic boards have failed to imitate this, they have slow and robotic moves like claw machines.",
      "We wanted to recover the human touch and mimic real movements as much as possible to provide the most enjoyable automated chess experience.",
      "Phantom's beautiful pieces glide flawlessly over the board. And while you won\u2019t be able to play blitz with it, the moves are fast and precise. It feels natural as if you are playing with another person.",
      "Through obsessive attention to detail, we custom-built every aspect of our chess board and pieces to feel like the most authentic set you have ever owned.",
      "The natural wooden board brings a timeless aesthetic. The chessmen are weighted and precisely balanced. We carefully curated the right material for the base of each piece, one that provides low friction for smooth autonomous motion, but doesn\u2019t change the feeling of playing chess.",
      "An autonomous board posed a unique design challenge. Because all the pieces must be able to travel between any other two, typical wide-base chess piece design would mean tiny pieces like those from a dollar store.",
      "We solved the problem and designed chess pieces that look and feel premium without being too bulky for the digitally enabled wooden board.",
      "Phantom brings you an unparalleled experience. Pieces moving naturally and gracefully. The whisper-quiet mechanism lets you enjoy the game without distractions.",
      "The Cordless Phantom version allows you to enjoy a great chess game wherever you are.",
      "Relax playing in your backyard on a sunny afternoon. Show off your autonomous board at the center of the room without any cumbersome cables. With its long-lasting battery, The Cordless Phantom makes the possibilities endless.",
      "We want to enable a deeper enjoyment of chess by allowing anyone to communicate with the Phantom Board using our Open Source Protocol. This means that anyone who wants to support our board will be able to do so. Tinkerers and hobbyists can use the board as a platform for any project they can imagine.",
      "We have been sharing the development of this project in our Hackaday.io post. We want to share every detail of the Phantom Chess so it is not only Open-Source, but also Open Hardware.",

      "We love chess.",
      "We believe chess holds significance for all humanity. Chess is art, history, science, creativity, passion, and so much more. So we set out to turn chess into a sculpture that pays homage to its legacy, while building a functional board that provides an exceptional experience.",
      "We are a team of experienced engineers and product designers with a huge passion for building robots, and we have dedicated the past 18 months to Phantom.",
      "It has taken a lot of mechanical and electronic engineering to create a system that moves flawlessly with uttermost precision and runs for years without issues. We\u2019ve invested hours testing our mechanisms and reviewing every last detail.",
      "The magic of Phantom is hard to describe and must be experienced to be understood. We want you to forget there is a robot inside the board, so we tweaked everything to be invisible to the point where you can just simply enjoy it. We ran already a beta-testing stage, where our first backers give us great feedback to help us define the last details of our board.",
      "The pieces needed to effortlessly glide across the board without touching each other. This required a meticulous design process and significant iteration until we reached such precision.",
      "Our goal was to create a piece of high engineering that embodies the perfection and beauty of chess, so high-quality materials and assembly methods were top priorities. We collaborated closely with wood suppliers for the pieces and the boards to create countless prototypes until we got it just right.",
      "After more than a year of hard work,  the Phantom board is fully developed and in final production prototyping phase. Our boards are completely integrated and we are currently working on improving the last aesthetic and functionality details to make it even better.",
      "Fully working prototype playing online",
      "Fully working prototype playing against AI",

      "If you want to learn more about our process and see every step of Phantom's development, check out our Hackaday page and follow us on Instagram.",
      "We moved forward, and the first units have reached our backers. We are delighted with their feedback, and after some adjustments, we are manufacturing at full speed. The current expectation is to complete all the IndieGoGo orders by the end of May. Here you can find some reviews:",
      "We\u2019ve already begun shipping Phantom boards to our backers and are deep into the fulfillment phase. With production running steadily and new batches going out each week, we expect to complete delivery of all Kickstarter and Indiegogo pre-orders by the end of July. Your support is helping bring Phantom to life\u2014thank you for joining us on the final stretch!",
      "Shipping will be charged on our Pledge Manager closer to the date of shipping. Shipping rates are very volatile right now, so we cannot provide an exact price.",
      "Currently, depending on the country, we calculate the shipping rates between $60-$125. We are working on getting the best deal for the shipping process to offer you the best rate and fastest delivery times.",
      "Are there taxes, duties, and VAT?",
      "Our price does not include any kind of fee imposed by your country. Those are regulated by the laws of each individual country, but we will do our best to minimize the additional cost.",
      "We have worked in the product development industry for more than a decade, and we have built strong relationships and systems to manage complex products.",
      "We are taking the following steps to minimize the most common issues IndieGoGo campaigns face:",
      "First of all, we are working with established suppliers. We have previously worked with our manufacturers and have created positive relationships with them. We have been developing and prototyping Phantom with their feedback since the beginning to ensure it is manufacturable and scalable.",
      "Secondly, we have set our timeline carefully. Many campaigns are over-optimistic, so when the time comes, they can\u2019t deliver in the promised timeline. We have taken the necessary steps to create a solid timeline and provide enough room to do everything we need to make sure we deliver an outstanding product.",
      "And lastly, communication is the most important thing between creators and backers. That\u2019s why we will post regular updates so you can see exactly what is happening in Phantom's development. In the event that something goes wrong, we will always keep you updated with both the reason for the issues and what steps are we taking to solve them.",
      "We look forward to partnering with you to bring Phantom to the world!",
      "This project collocates surveys by PledgeBox, the Pledge Management system helped thousands of creators to be more successful with more sales and satisfied millions of backers.",

      "Bio acetate is made of cellulose, whose fibers are very strong and hard to break. This is what ensures that, even after many years of usage, bio acetate frames do not lose their shape and structure.",
      "Made of cotton and wood, the material is subjected to a fifteen-stage process, becoming what is also known as bio acetate. This process ensures not only that Shivas are super resistant to shock and scratches, but also that they can withstand extreme heat.",
      "To provide the best possible experience, we brought to you these unique sustainable frames together with the New Generation of Polaroid lenses with 9 layers of protection (2 layers scratch-resistant, 2 layers shock-resistant, 4 layers of UV400 protection (maximum UV protection) and 1 main layer of polarization).",
      "They offer guaranteed maximum UV rays protection and are free of glare.",
      "The Shiva lens is unbreakable with its two layers of shock resistance and an additional two layers of scratch resistance!",
      "Although it comes from cotton fibers and wood pulp, during the 15-stage process to the final version, it becomes waterproof, so you can wash it as many times as you want.",
      "We spent countless hours brainstorming, researching, and testing our materials to make sure our Shivas would turn out exactly as we had imagined!",

We wanted to create greener sunglasses by opting for alternatives to the regular materials currently being used by other brands.

Just 30 seconds to go from a beach lounger to a backpack with a lot of cool features, a real portable all-in-one solution for outdoor lovers, couples, and families to relax.",
      "We all faced it: enjoying outdoor life could be stressful. Wild beautiful free beaches don't usually offer facilities and your nearby city parks don't have places to lay down comfortably. So you'll find yourself carrying many bags and a lot of things like sun umbrellas, chairs, towels and more.",

BeachBack can hold everything you need for a day trip. At the right time, it can be transformed into a practical sunbed in just 30 seconds. So, you can relax without compromise and without depending on expensive tourist facilities.",

      "In sunbed mode, BeachBack offers a complete solution with a headrest, sun canopy and extendable awning, wind-resistant towel, and a wide range of pockets and compartments, including an insulated pocket, and a pocket for a solar power bank.",
      "BeachBack can also be coupled (up to two, three, or more) allowing you to create a relaxation shaded area for couples or families.",
      "BeachBack is also a very practical 35 liters backpack, designed to be comfortable: the padded shoulder straps and the weight distribution belts make it easy to load it on your shoulders or take it by hand as a duffle bag.",
      "The high capacity allows you to bring everything you need for a day of leisure and organize it at best thanks to its various functional pockets. It's fair to say that BeachBack is an actual, proper, backpack, not just a beach chair with shoulder straps.",

      "We had the first idea for a backpack beach lounger back in 2020 and from that point, we went through a long brainstorming and R&D process that brought us here on Kickstarter. Sketches after sketches and many prototypes after, we got the current DFM prototype which is ready for production.",
      "Whether it's a lunch break at the park or a day at the beach or the lake, BeachBack can adapt to all your needs and offer you endless opportunities to recharge in close contact with nature: select the perk that fit your needs.",

      "** Prices do not include taxes and VAT. That will be subject to the laws and regulations of each individual country.",

      "High-quality knives have 3 very major purposes in daily cooking: Fits perfectly in your hand, razor-sharp cutting with a long-lasting cutting edge, and a part of the kitchen interior design.",
      "By uniting centuries of Japanese knife-making knowledge with Danish minimalistic design we have been able to create what we believe is the best kitchen knife series on the market.",
      "The kitchen knife has been a part of our cooking for as long as we can date back in history. However, remaking kitchen knives to be more than just a simple tool is difficult.",
      "We teamed up with a professional industrial Design Engineer in order to create the perfect balance between ultimate sharpness, comfortable grip, and unique aesthetics.",
      "Hundreds of design sketches. Dozens of 3D-printed models. Countless tomatoes, onions, and carrots cut (but not wasted!). All of these have been necessary to build, test, and learn what makes the Perfect Kitchen Knife Series.",
      "In order to make sure that we were able to create the Perfect Kitchen knife series, we used a small team of professional chefs led by the Danish Michelin Star chef, Michael N\u00f8rtoft.",

    "description": "4'11\"x8'2\"|Fully Enclosed & Smoke-Free|LightBurn CNC| 60W Adjustable Laser | 90% Pre-assembled",
    "company_name": "Tyvok",
    "allParagraphs": [
      "4'11\"x8'2\"|Fully Enclosed & Smoke-Free|LightBurn CNC| 60W Adjustable Laser | 90% Pre-assembled",
      "Receiving a lot of feedback from our European users, we decided to further upgrade the size of all 4'1\"x8' Spider S1 machines to 4'11\" x 8'2\" (1500x2500mm), with a working area of 1300x2440mm! This means both U.S. Standard Full-sheet  (1220mm x 2440mm), as well as European Standard Full-sheet (1250mm x 2500mm), can work directly with Spider S1, reducing material waste and making the process more efficient!",
      "Over the past two years, Tyvok has successfully launched and fulfilled two highly innovative projects. Building on the experience from those projects and continuous product innovation, along with user feedback, Tyvok has been pushing the boundaries of laser engravers, exploring new possibilities. This time, we've truly expanded those boundaries!",
      "Spider S1 's expansive 4'11\" x 8'2\" (1500x2500mm) work area is able to handle the whole board at once. Perfect for large-scale projects as well as mass production. Save yourself the hassle of multiple cutting sessions and material changes.",
      "No need for pre-cutting or preparation. From now on, you can start working directly with whole boards! The Spider S1's unique front-opening design allows you to easily slide entire boards in from the front. This not only saves you time but also maximizes material usage and minimizes waste.",
      "The Spider S1 features a fully enclosed design that prevents smoke and laser leakage, ensuring user safety even after extended working hours.",
      "With its top cover made of high-performance flame-retardant materials, S1 provides an extra layer of safety for users.",
      "S1 is also equipped with a safety lock. If the top cover is opened suddenly during operation, the machine will automatically stop to minimize laser and smoke exposure. However, if you need to monitor the progress at any time, you can disable the safety lock in the machine settings.",
      "Unlike traditional machines that struggle with smoke and noise, the Spider S1\u2019s automatic fire control and efficient exhaust system keep your workspace clean and secure.",
      "Specific projects can generate significant smoke and dust, impacting your experience and work quality. The Spider S1 addresses this with an integrated smoke fire extinguishing system that automatically manages fires or high temperatures, ensuring safe operation. With the built-in mini fire extinguisher, user and product safety is ensured even in the event of an unexpected flame.",
      "With the advanced thermal aerosol technology, each unit effectively protects a 0.5 cubic meter area, and with two units, a 1 cubic meter space is fully safeguarded, providing comprehensive coverage for the entire enclosed area.",
      "Since the primary fire risk is located near the X-axis laser head, deploying mini fire suppression units at both ends of the X-axis is generally recommended.",
      "The 60W semiconductor laser equipped on the Spider S1 is powerful enough for your most ambitious ideas.",
      "The laser head is equipped with an automatic frequency reduction feature, allowing the power to be adjusted from 60W down to 40W and 20W. This reduction in power not only minimizes the spot size for more precise engraving on different materials but also extends the laser's lifespan.",
      "With its high-power 60W laser, the Spider S1 dramatically improves work efficiency. The increased power enables quicker engraving and cutting, allowing you to complete projects faster.",
      "Spider S1 has undergone extensive testing on various materials, thicknesses, and power settings. Here, we can showcase some of these tests across different materials to help users easily set the optimal parameters during use. This provides users with a reference for achieving the best performance and precision.",
      "The laser fan automatically starts and stops, making work safer, quieter, and smarter.",
      "Built-in Air Assist Duct: The system features a built-in air assist duct, eliminating the need for an external air assist setup. This integrated design results in greater precision and a more streamlined appearance.",
      "Not only laser, the Spider S1 also excels in high-precision CNC cutting based on LightBurn.",
      "Equipped with its 2nd-gen Artist Precision Module, you can easily create stunning reliefs and dive into woodworking with a minimal learning curve.",
      "The CNC module based on LightBurn is a module that reads the laser PWM protocol and maps the grayscale values to the set depth values. It allows laser engraver users to compile toolpaths in LightBurn through simple settings, enabling basic CNC cutting tasks.",
      "With the Spider S1, all you need is easy-to-use laser engraving software to perform both relief engraving and cutting. No specialized CNC knowledge is required, the module can be easily operated through LightBurn and LaserGRBL.",
      "Thanks to its self-developed rack and gear coupling system, Spider S1 effectively reduces errors even when the work area is expanded, ensuring perfect results for large-format engraving and complex cuts. The Spider S1 consistently retains its accuracy, allowing seamless upgrades and expansions without sacrificing performance.",
      "While the Spider S1 offers top-tier professional features, its installation process is designed to be beginner-friendly. The machine is divided into four main modules, each pre-assembled with key components. Users only need to connect the frame using plug-in connectors, ensuring a quick and stable assembly process.",
      "The newly developed support kit now allows users who select the 4'11\"x8'2\" version to choose between installing a 4'11\"x4'11\" half-size board or the full 4'11\"x8'2\" size, based on their specific needs. It\u2019s like having two large-format machines in one, and can easily switch between them as needed.",
      "This accessory kit, valued at $99, is completely free for Kickstarter backers, as a special thank-you from Tyvok. We invite you to take advantage of this offer and enhance your creative projects with greater flexibility and freedom!",
      "For business owners with mass production needs, the Spider S1 supports controlling multiple machines from a single computer. This allows you to execute the same or different tasks across several Spider S1 units simultaneously.",
      "The lightweight, integrated platform board is 70% lighter than conventional honeycomb boards, making it ideal for large-format projects.",
      "Its unique elevated design effectively aids in venting the smoke generated during laser cutting.",
      "The Tyvok expandable platform board is lightweight, easy to expand, easy to clean, heats evenly, and does not require a steel plate.",
      "*Please note that the platform board needs to be added separately as an add-on.",
      "Tyvok will provide a 1-year warranty on machine parts and hardware, 3-month warranty on laser tubes and power supplies, and quality assurance service to all backers of this Kickstarter campaign.",
      "Any quality issues caused by non-human factors under reasonable and proper use. The warranty does not cover products that have been improperly stored, assembled, or used. It also does not apply to damage caused by accidents such as tearing, cutting, or scratching. If any such issues arise, we will supply free replacement parts.",
      "The warranty period starts from the date of delivery, and proof of purchase must be provided.",
      "Shipping costs will be charged separately after the project ends. Due to the large size and weight of the Spider S1 and some of its accessories, even slight fluctuations in international shipping rates can result in significant price differences. To ensure you don't pay more than the actual shipping cost, the shipping fee will be collected separately through a backer survey before shipping officially begins.",
      "You can refer to the following table for an estimate of the possible shipping cost range. We will also do our best to secure the most favorable rates.",
      "The Smileme team is committed to the continuous exploration in the field of laser engraving and cutting. Our team members come from world-renowned companies in various fields such as structure, algorithms, electronics, hardware, software, etc.",
      "Our team has experts in professional modeling. In the ongoing production process of medium and large format modeling, we deeply suffered from using the engraver and cutter with the current X-Y structure, which has problems like low space expansion, high cost, heavyweight, not enough portable, etc.",

      "Initially, there may be an imbalance between the number of teens looking for work and adults posting tasks. We\u2019re mitigating this by offering incentives for early adopters, such as discounted service fees for task posters and bonuses for teens completing their first job.",
      "Keeping users engaged over time is a challenge for any app. We plan to address this by continually improving Honey Hustle based on user feedback and introducing features like badges, ratings, and leaderboards to keep it fun and rewarding.\nBy identifying these challenges early and creating strategies to address them, we\u2019re confident in our ability to successfully bring Honey Hustle to life and make a positive impact in our communities.",

      "We\u2019re back on Indiegogo. Two years ago, we started our campaign for a smartphone that gives us back our freedom. Thanks to our backers, the Volla Phone was born again with a completely new operating concept and uncompromising privacy protection. Since then, thousands of devices have been shipped to over 55 countries around the world.",
      "Thus, a community of developers and users has emerged. Their ideas inspired us to prepare an evolutionary leap: The Volla Phone 22. It combines classy design, high performance, and hardware sustainability. Here\u2019s to a second-generation Volla OS that is even smarter, simpler, and more secure!",
      "IMMEDIATE AND INTELLIGENT",
      "Instead of countless apps, the Volla OS offers quick and effortless access to all important everyday functions and information from the springboard, your home screen. This takes smartphone accessibility to a level of efficiency never before seen.",
      "Customize the look and feel of the Volla OS with a dark and light mode or the translucent mode with the background image of your choice.",
      "And these are the #1 upgrades that no other smartphone has offered before:",
      "SAVE AND SECURE",
      "The Volla OS is based on the open-source Android Open Source Project (AOSP) and does without Google Apps and Play services to protect your privacy. A combination of measures and technologies ensures high security:",
      "And these are the novelties that make your Volla Phone 22 a fortress:",
      "From the springboard settings, activate the security mode with a single gesture, protected by a password:",
      "With the security mode, you can give your child a Volla Phone and keep your peace of mind. Be confident that your child won't see anything that is not suitable for children. Additionally, you can whitelist designated apps and sites such as access to a school's website.",
      "Additional advantage: If you have to use an app for work, study, or private use that could lead to user data collection, you can specifically block these connections or block the app completely if you don't need it.",
      "Optionally, you can get the Volla Phone 22 again with the mobile Linux operating system Ubuntu Touch, which is completely independent of Android and includes its own app store.",
      "Perfect for Linux users and minimalists",
      "Those who already use Ubuntu on their PC or laptop will find themselves in a perfectly tuned world with a familiar user interface that has been optimized for smartphones.",

      "And these are advancements that will turn your Volla Phone 22 into the all-in-one choice:",
      "It's a world premiere: We equip the Volla Phone 22 with a multi-boot function as standard. Via the system settings, you can install a second or even additional operating system as you would an app and simply select it at startup.",

      "Hardware. The perfect combination of aesthetics and performance",
      "With its minimalist design, the Volla Phone 22 conveys pure elegance and focus on the essentials. The main camera with dual-lens is embedded in the back of the case, which lies flat and sleek and reduces bulk.",
      "The tempered glass layer not only protects the lenses but also gives the smartphone a high-quality look. The rounded sides make the Volla Phone 22 fit perfectly in the hand.",
      "The colors available are fresh white and elegant black with a piano finish.",
      "Device features make for cutting-edge performance.",
      "With a 3x higher camera resolution, a 2x higher memory capacity, and the MTK Helio G85 processor with optimized performance through Mediatek HyperEngine technology, the new Volla Phone 22 is well prepared for the future.",
      "In addition to two nano-SIM cards, the design now allows you to use a memory card of up to half a terabyte at the same time.",
      "Please note that we provide a white fingerprint sensor with a silver frame for the series producton of the white variant. This looks even lighter and more elegant.",
      "Sustainability taken a step further.",
      "Together with the slim Volla OS operating system and long-standing software updates, the Volla Phone 22 also scores in sustainability.",
      "But this time we go the additional step.",
      "At the request of the Volla community, the Volla Phone 22 includes a user-replaceable battery that also provides up to 350 hours of standby. With its 4,500 mAh power, it allows plenty of charging cycles backed by Libitum polymer technology.",
      "The manufacturing is once again engineered with high-precision machines in Germany.",
      "OUTPERFORMING TECHNICAL STATS",
      "We offer donors outside Europe to check carefully if the Volla Phone 22 supports the frequency bands of their provider's mobile network. The good news is that the Volla Phone 22 will support even more frequency bands than the previous model for international use.",
      "From the beginning, we developed the Volla Phone with you in mind. We envisioned an option for our users to stay independent and protect their data.",
      "We are not venture capital-funded and solely operate on existing cash flow. With this approach, we achieve stability and independence. However, it presents us with challenges for new products.",
      "With your help, we can create a private space full of personal freedoms on your smartphone.",

      "There may also be a delay in shipping the reward due to a lack of drivers at German logistics companies. However, we do not observe any significant delays from our partners DHL and DHL Express in our daily business yet.",

      "The CS106 is so paranoid about my safety, it's almost comical. The anti-pinch bumper and the dome that will never fully close ensure a safe and unobstructed passage for my entire body, making bathroom breaks a breeze.",
      "The CS106 is so fancy, it practically cleans itself! My human used to spend hours scooping litter, but now they just press and hold a button on the touch panel and it's done. I think the CS106 is trying to take their job! But hey, I'm not complaining.",
      "The CS106 comes with a large pore filter as standard, designed to handle mainstream litters like Clumping Clay Litter, Cassava Cat Litter, Cassava-Tofu Mix, Tofu Cat Litter, and Tofu-Bentonite Mix. For finer litters, a small pore filter\u2014available as an add-on\u2014efficiently filters mineral and crystal litters, ensuring versatility for all your needs.",
      "My human is obsessed with the CS106 app! It tells them how often I visit my litter box, how long I stay, and how often it gets cleaned\u2014or when it\u2019s time to clean. They can even clean it from their phone\u2014magic! The app does other cool stuff too, but it\u2019s super easy to use\u2014no genius needed!",
      "The CS106 is so quiet, it's like having a ninja clean up after me. At just 38.8 decibels, it's quieter than a mouse on tiptoes. My human can sleep soundly knowing that their precious sleep won't be disturbed by the litter box.",
      "The CS106 is designed with easy cleaning in mind. It can be disassembled in just three simple steps, and the rounded corners make it a cinch to wipe down. It's so easy to keep clean, my human will actually enjoy cleaning the litter box!",
      "It comes with a super tough pad that\u2019s waterproof, scratch-proof, and bite-proof, with a little lip to stop any leaks from my accidents. So even if I mess up, my human doesn\u2019t have to deal with a big cleanup!",
      "We\u2019re committed to ensuring theCS106 works perfectly for you. We\u2019re setting up after-sales service centers in the U.S. and Germany to support our first batch of Indiegogo backers with:",

      "As a 10-year veteran in the pet tech industry, we knew the risks of creating the world\u2019s largest automatic litter box. Many competitors avoid this size due to the high costs, but we saw a need for a litter box that big cats could use comfortably. Driven by our mission to improve cats\u2019 lives, we took on the challenge and created the CS106.",

      "Delays in manufacturing or shipping could push our timeline, and unexpected costs might arise. Additionally, potential tariff increases in the U.S. and varying VAT policies in Europe could add uncertainty to our costs and delivery. However, with our experience in precision engineering and past crowdfunding successes, we\u2019re ready to tackle these hurdles. We\u2019ve planned buffer time and partnered with reliable manufacturers to ensure smooth delivery by May 2025.",

What a great little keepsake that we didn\u2019t think about!! She is also in the last trimester so obviously not getting any sleep with all the kicking/Braxton Hicks. So the brightening eye cream for mama is going to start getting a lot of use!! The early education development cards are an awesome way to stimulate baby's brain and eye development. We also could not believe how thoughtful they were when boxing this up. She has a high-risk pregnancy so when we saw that they disinfected the box and contents with UV light we were super impressed! Everything in this box is super helpful. She can\u2019t wait to use them with baby and to continue her subscription with Mamafrog!\n10/10 would recommend!!!\" --Jojo Nichole",

I think it\u2019s so wonderful how they carefully curate a handful of all-natural and sustainably sourced products that can help boost your babies development.

We wanted to give you the feeling of being in a village of people you love while you find things you love.",
      "We love Pinterest, but like many others looking for alternatives, we are unhappy it has essentially become an ad-heavy image-based shopping platform. The ads are useful when shopping, but most of the time when we open the app, we just want to see awesome images, art, and ideas. To see one awesome image, you have to see four ads.",
      "Worst of all, ads often masquerade as pinnable content, tricking you into clicking it and redirecting to advertiser sites instead of letting you save what you thought was genuine content.",

      "People from all over the world can join your colony. While most people are awesome, if you want a lively group chat that's comfortable for you, where you can truly get to know others, their ideas, projects, and more, you'll need to filter people in/out in meaningful ways.",

Our strategy to mitigate these includes a lean development approach to maximize our Kickstarter funds, a focused marketing plan targeting niche interest communities, and a commitment to transparent, user-driven development, ensuring PeaColony evolves directly with your feedback.

Kouwi has been a long time dream of mine to give back to our society and help improve health and well-being in young people and young adults. Kouwi was inspired from a game I use to play when I was a child back in St. Lucia where I grew up. We would make a similar tool using old bucket lids and thick wire and this would keep all the children in the community entertained. That was an era with little electricity, console or online presence. Today me and my team have re-created this childhood game and hope to create a new sport around the apparatus called kouwi ball.",
      "KOUWI simply put is a running companion sport tool in the free form fitness category with a unique value proposition. An innovation with the simple goal of getting young people outside. It's fun, takes skill to use and enjoyable whether you use it alone or with friends. Kouwi encourages peer participation, making fitness more sociable and fun.",
      "In an increasingly tech driven society, outdoor activities can be seen as boring and monotonous. This product is designed to lure young people outside to do more physical activity which may help reduce the problem of obesity which is straining the NHS  and medical bodies around the world.",

    "description": "The comic book spinner rack from our youth -- at an amazing price. And now it disassembles!",
    "company_name": "David Campiti",
    "allParagraphs": [
      "The comic book spinner rack from our youth -- at an amazing price. And now it disassembles!",
      "...I was a kid running after school on Tuesdays and Thursdays to McNamara's Drug Store to buy the newest comic books.  The Gold Key, Classics Illustrated, Harvey, and other comics sat on a large wooden magazine display. But the Marvels and DCs were proudly presented on two comic book spinner racks that formed the backbone of my comic book memories.",
      "Decades later, I purchased two spinner racks when I was running Innovation Publishing; they didn't quite have the graphics topper I remembered, but close enough. I'd schlep those racks to and from our minivan to the convention floor, usually scraping up my hands and arms in the process because the original shipping boxes were long gone.  But I loved how our comics looked displayed on those racks, both at Conventions and in my office.  I still have those racks, one of them in my office until recently showing off some of the comics Glass House Graphics produces for our clients.  I've spray painted it several times, oiled the bearings, and cursed the squeaking sound it makes because of a long-missing plastic piece that fit the pole.",
      "...Why the hell didn't someone make an AFFORDABLE comic book rack that could be easily taken to conventions -- and be assembled and disassembled so it wasn't cumbersome to carry?",
      "I mean, I looked on Etsy and eBay and discovered, IF they sold any comics spinner rack at all, it was insanely priced at $1,200.00 (just the rack, without the base and pole) to $1,500.00 each (complete, yet offering pickup only no shipping option).  Seriously insane!",
      "So, I checked Diamond Comic Distributors, and they theoretically sold one for $400.00 IF it was in stock (as I type this, it's not) plus shipping that could be $100 to $200 depending on where you are. Still a 6-foot monster box to transport, that meant basically SIX HUNDRED BUCKS for a comic rack, IF you could get it. Still insane!",
      "I contacted suppliers in the USA and all over the world to see if anyone still made the classic rack I was looking for.  Nobody did.  A few suppliers sold versions of a rack that just didn't look right. Nobody seemed to offer either version of the spinner rack long burned into memory. Some offered to build a custom rack. I was fine with that and gave specs. Then I discovered that SHIPPING from them to me, or drop-shipping from them to you, was between $150 and $200 for one rack!  That's crazy.  Nope.  Not happening.",
      "Then I thought about all those Conventions where I cut up my hands and arms and scraped up car seats and even damaged my dashboard trying to wedge comic racks into my car.  Enough of that!",
      "What If I designed a full-sized, 40-pocket spinner rack, with the long-remembered classic design, that could be taken apart and easily transported in a wheeled carrier?  SO, I DID!",
      "I kept a close eye (sometimes both eyes!) on the manufacturer building the prototypes --",
      "After we tweaked and fiddled and painted, it was ready.  It was a thing of beauty right from my childhood.",
      "I was pleased to discover that my redesign allowed me to ship the rack for about one-third of the cost UPS/FedEx/DHL/USPS quoted me for shipping the original rack design.  That meant I could simplify life for everyone by offering the spinner rack bundled with FREE USA SHIPPING!  What's more, we could offer economical shipping to Canada and most of Europe.",
      "I even worked with our manufacturer to select an optional, properly sized canvas carrier with three wheels for stability, to make the schlepping simple!",
      "Each carrier also sports its own custom spinner rack logo tag, so you immediately know which bag holds your rack --",
      "This spinner rack comes with TWO grand graphics topper designs, two of each, created by Glass House Graphics' letterer/designer Keith Gleason --",
      "What's more, all four headers are CUSTOMIZABLE!  You can ADD ON this alternate set of graphics toppers (two of each sold as a set)--",
      "(I'm particularly happy that the HEY, KIDS! finally has a comma where it belongs.)",
      "FIRST, A BIT ABOUT SHIPPING: Thanks to canny craftsmanship, careful package planning, and a whole lot of dumb luck, we found a shipping \"sweet spot\" that allows us to offer this Spinner Rack with U.S. shipping included in the price. What's more, shipping one rack to Canada only adds $25 to the total. And we can ship it to much of Europe for only $25 over that. AND we now can ship to Australia for only $80. Unfortunately, that shipping \"sweet spot\" does not extend to shipping to the rest of the world so I'm offering it to the countries where we can. DISCLAIMER: I have no control over Customs in any country, nor the upcoming administration's planned Tariffs, so I cannot predict or accommodate how they will affect/handle overseas shipments.",
      "PRODUCTION & TIMEFRAME: The examples you see in the photos and video are the prototypes made from my design; I'll be fine-tuning certain elements until production begins. The manufacturer drop-shipped the prototypes to me so I could see them boxed the same way you'll receive them. Our timeline is to ship in June 2025 for delivery in July. The manufacturer has assured us that production will only take 8 weeks, but we've padded the release schedule with two extra months to deal with any difficulties. Manufacturer will drop-ship directly to you, saving time and money. Only the T-shirts and such will be shipped from my office warehouse.",
      "Long-lasting design",
      "Powder-coated steel and dual-supported ball bearings should give this 21st Century Comic Book Spinner Rack long life, just like the original classic racks you remember.",
      "Reusability and recyclability",
      "The plastic bags and foam packing are re-usable when you break down the rack for transport. The double-box we ship to you can be re-used or recycled. Or both.",
      "Something else",
      "By drop-shipping to you directly from the manufacturer instead of shipping to a warehouse and re-shipped, we're saving time, money, and transportation resources for literally tons of freight.",

      "In the fast-paced world of modern life, where simplicity and practicality have become the goal of every one of us, the Y-IN is the perfect tool for the job.",
      "The two ends of the tool are switched between different functions by a rotating mechanism, ensuring easier and quicker use. All you need to do is to gently rotate both ends of the tool to change smoothly. The rotating action is simple and intuitive, and each tool head has a clear sense of snap, so that it won't come loose when you use it due to mishandling. Easy and ingenious opening.",
      "This multifunctional tool is designed to fulfill more than just everyday needs; its ingenious construction gives it the potential of a fingertip gyroscope. Both ends of the tool can be rotated, providing a fun and interactive experience. When you need a moment of relaxation, with a simple twist, it can become your \u201clittle toy\u201d to relieve stress and eliminate anxiety. A little spice in the busy work, it brings a sense of unintentional comfort. Fun way to open.",

      "It's not just a tool, it's an indispensable partner in your life, making every day full of more possibilities.",
      "Pry bar",
      "It can be used as a prying tool, and has multiple functions such as opening cans, prying nails, and opening express boxes. When camping or exploring outdoors, you can easily pry open cans to facilitate meals; in home repairs, it can be used to pull out nails, saving the trouble of carrying a large crowbar; when sending and receiving express deliveries, you can also easily open boxes without the need for additional scissors or knives.",
      "Wrench hole",
      "The hexagonal wrench hole is designed to be used not only as a wrench, but also with hexagonal nuts and screws of various specifications, bringing convenience to various small maintenance tasks. During outdoor activities or travel, it can be used to adjust the bolts of bicycles, skateboards, trekking poles and other equipment to ensure that the equipment is firm and reliable. In daily life, it can also quickly complete emergency adjustment tasks for furniture installation or home appliance repair, without having to frequently switch tools.",

In addition, its prying function is particularly suitable for outdoor adventures and home DIY, which can efficiently pull out nails on wooden boards or walls, reducing the trouble of using large tools.",
      "Replaceable screw heads",
      "The hexagonal hole design is a highlight. It is compatible with common standard screw heads on the market and can replace screw heads of different specifications, which is very suitable for emergency repair tasks. For example, when the screws of your bicycle, skateboard or suitcase are loose, it can quickly adjust them, eliminating the burden of carrying a screwdriver. The titanium alloy material brings high strength and durability. Whether in daily use or in wet and harsh outdoor environments, it can maintain stable performance, allowing you to respond to sudden needs at any time in various usage scenarios.",
      "Clip/Assist",

      "Tritium slot",
      "There are two tritium tube slots on each side, which can be installed with tritium gas luminous tubes, making the product recognizable at night. Tritium tubes do not rely on external light sources and can continue to glow even in a completely dark environment, making tools easier to find in low-light conditions, especially suitable for use in night camping, exploration or emergency situations. In addition, tritium tubes have an extremely long service life, do not require batteries or charging, and can glow for a long time, providing users with stable nighttime visibility. This design not only improves the practicality of the product, but also increases its visual beauty.",

    "company_name": "Christoph Burkhardt",
    "allParagraphs": [
      "Eliminate 99.99% of airborne particles with groundbreaking plasma technology & never replace filters",
      "OneLife X is a high-performance air purifier with revolutionary plasma technology that filters your air with clinical precision. It uses a high-precision laser sensor to track even the smallest detectable particles in your air. Unlike other air purifiers, OneLife X produces no harmful ozone and has no costly filters to replace.",
      "To say Onelife X is the best air purifier to hit the market would be an understatement\u2014it\u2019s the future of air purification!",
      "Our next-generation air purifying plasma filter eliminates 99.99% of airborne particles without the need to replace the filter, ever.",
      "OneLife X uses a high-precision laser sensor that detects particles as small as 1 micrometer, then the plasma technology removes particles down to 0.01 micrometers, meaning it removes even viruses and ultrafine particles out of your breathing air that most purifiers miss.",
      "Most air purifiers use standard HEPA filters that are incapable of capturing particles smaller than 0.3 micrometer.",
      "OneLife X has metallic plates in the filter that act like giant magnets for all the pollutants in the air. When air is pulled into the device, it passes through the plasma field where pollution particles get charged up (ionized) so they stick right to the collector sheets.",
      "Using this plasma field to ionize the particles instead of forcing air through a thick filter means there's no restriction of airflow, so One Life X requires very little energy, runs virtually silently, and generates no harmful ozone.",
      "The independent lab test by IUTA shows that \u201cOneLife X can provide per hour, on average, about 121 cubic meters of air free of particles, including viruses and small exhaled droplets that are potentially virus-laden. The filtration efficiency for larger exhaled droplets is even larger, resulting in a CADR of 131 cubic meters per hour.\u201d",
      "The independent lab also tested for Ozone Emission. IUTA concluded that OneLife X does NOT add ozone to the room even after 60 minutes of constant purification. The lab stated: \u201cThe amount of emitted ozone lies with (1.6 \u00b1 1.8) ppb substantially below the limit of 50 ppb specified by UL 867-37.\u201d",
      "In the graph below you see the ozone concentration as a black line (with the OneLife X running full speed) and a red line (the natural background levels of ozone that are always present). They are almost identical and far lower than the officially accepted concentration of ozone in a room.",
      "HEPA? No thanks\u2014sounds like a bad infection.",
      "The OneLife X plasma filter never needs to be replaced. It\u2019s washable and dishwasher safe, meaning it won\u2019t pollute the environment with non-recyclable plastics and filter waste.",
      "This is as sustainable and affordable as it gets.",
      "Other air purifiers use pricey HEPA filters that need to be changed often and cost more to operate. HEPA technology hasn't been updated in more than 70 years!",
      "OneLife X delivers the highest purification performance with the lowest energy consumption. At just 6 watts, it consumes less than an average LED lamp! This means you get the most clinically clean air while saving money on energy bills.",
      "Other air purifiers cost $30-120 per year because they require a high-speed fan to press air through fibreglass mats inside the air filter. High-speed fans and pressure means loud, disrupting noise levels plus increased energy consumption, resulting in higher energy bills.",
      "Our technology purifies the air without restricting airflow, so it doesn't need high-energy fan pressure. This enables us to run the fan at a super low ventilation rate, making the purifier absolutely silent",
      "It\u2019s so quiet you can run it right next to your bed\u2014try that with a HEPA filter!",
      "OneLife X looks and feels like a piece of furniture. Our team of designers crafted OneLife X to fit effortlessly and beautifully into any modern-day home or office.",
      "Plus, it operates standing or laying flat, so it fits in any space.",
      "The textile cover is made from recycled PET plastic bottles, keeping that discarded plastic out of landfills and from breaking down into microplastics that can cause serious health issues.",
      "OneLife X\u2019s renewable filter design makes it the most sustainable filter on the market, purifying your air while protecting the plant.",
      "OneLife X alerts you when it is time to wash the filter, and has three air-purifying modes:",
      "OneLife X provides clinically pure air exactly where you want it with a tilt feature that lets you deliver clean-air immediately within your personal air space.",
      "The OneLife X app gives you detailed data on indoor air quality and outdoor pollutants so you can monitor your air quality from anywhere, effortlessly.",
      "Plus, the app lets you input your personal air purification needs (like if you have asthma, allergies or pets) and OneLife X adjusts its settings automatically!",
      "In addition to measuring pollutants in your air, OneLife X also measures temperature and humidity.",
      "The OneLife X app displays indoor AND outdoor air quality levels using the BreezoMeter. By getting the live outdoor pollution data from local air quality indices (AQIs), we are able to recommend if the air quality is good enough for your outdoor activities or for you to open the windows.",
      "The average human takes 17,000 breaths a day and inhales 2,000 gallons of air. Pure air is for everyone\u2014and so is OneLife X.",
      "*Add a carbon filter to your OneLife X to ensure that in addition to all the particles, all odors get absorbed from your air. Gases will get trapped and retained inside the activated carbon to provide you with clean air without any bad odors.",
      "New to Indiegogo? No problem. Follow these simple steps to get your own OneLife X.",
      "At the end of the campaign, we\u2019ll send you a survey to get your shipping information and deliver your OneLife X when manufacturing is completed",
      "Our story started over five years ago in Germany. We\u2019re a team of scientists, engineers and dreamers who recognized that the air that we breathe is harming our health\u2014and no health tech company was going to fix it (they just love their business models around filter replacement too much to upgrade the technology).",
      "So we started OneLife X with one simple goal: to create clean air with a clear conscience. Our mission to improve air home quality around the globe wouldn\u2019t be meaningful if it harmed the environment (like HEPA filters do), so we set out to create a completely new generation of air purification.",
      "With no filter to replace, the lowest energy profile in the market, the greenest technology available and a high performance plasma filter that catches even the smallest pollutants, the OneLife X you see today has exceeded our wildest expectations.",
