      "Help bring promising treatments from the lab to the people who need them \u2013 when pharma won\u2019t",
      "Mel Dixon\u2019s two children, Tom and Rosie, have a devastating neurodegenerative condition so rare it doesn\u2019t even have a name. There is no approved treatment. But researchers at top UK universities are developing one. The science is promising \u2013 but there\u2019s no funding to run a trial.",
      "Why? Because big drug companies don\u2019t see enough profit in rare diseases like theirs. So nothing happens.",
      "That\u2019s where Patient Powered Research comes in. We\u2019re building a new system \u2013 one that gives patients, families and supporters a clear, ethical way to help fund neglected treatments and unlock the cures pharma won\u2019t touch.",
      "We\u2019ve done it once. Now we\u2019re building a platform to do it again \u2013 and again.",
      "We\u2019re not asking you to fund a trial today.",
      "We\u2019re asking you to help build the system that makes those trials possible. We need six months funding to get going.",
      "Your donation will help us:",
      "In other words, we are asking you to help us kickstart this project so we can lay the foundations now and unlock forgotten cures for patients for years to come.",
      "Every year, life-changing treatments for rare diseases are shelved in laboratories \u2013 not because they don\u2019t work, but because there\u2019s no money to test them in real patients.",
      "Examples include:",
      "These aren\u2019t fringe ideas. They\u2019re peer-reviewed, lab-tested, and sometimes even proven in animals. But they fall into what scientists call the Valley of Death \u2013 the space between discovery and treatment \u2013 because no one is willing to pay for the trials.",
      "But we are.",
      "We\u2019re building a platform that connects unfunded research with the people who need it \u2013 ethically, transparently, and under expert oversight.",
      "We call it Patient Powered Research. It\u2019s a way for patients or families to help fund clinical trials for neglected treatments \u2013 and potentially take part in them, if they qualify \u2013 while still respecting ethics, safety and scientific integrity.",
      "We\u2019ve published the model in the Journal of Medical Ethics, and the BMJ Open. It\u2019s been covered by The Financial Times, The Daily Mail, The Guardian and The Daily Telegraph.",
      "And it\u2019s been backed by ethicists, scientists and institutions including:",
      "In 2012, we used a version of this model to raise \u00a31.5 million in just eight months to fund a clinical trial in Sweden.",
      "The Financial Times called it:",
      "\u201cThe most successful medical crowdfunding campaign in internet history.\u201d",
      "And the lead researcher on that trial said this:",
      "\u201cAlexander and Dominic are probably the two most knowledgeable individuals when it comes to understanding how patients and their relatives and friends can influence medical research. Their idea to use crowdfunding to raise money for helping our promising medication into a clinical trial for cancer patients was highly successful and 12 patients have been treated so far. Their relentless work brings hope to individuals wishing to help but not knowing exactly how.\u201d",
      "\u2014 Professor Magnus Essand, Gene Therapy Researcher, Uppsala University",
      "Now we\u2019re ready to build the full system and make it work again \u2013 for families like Mel\u2019s and many more.",
      "Most rare diseases don\u2019t attract big money. There\u2019s no profit, so there\u2019s no progress.",
      "But these treatments often have wider potential. Tom and Rosie\u2019s condition, for example, is linked to protein and fat transport in cells \u2013 a process that\u2019s also involved in Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, epilepsy, and more.",
      "By helping rare disease families, we might unlock answers for millions",
      "This November, we\u2019re bringing together scientists, ethicists, and patient advocates at the Brocher Foundation in Geneva \u2013 Europe\u2019s leading bioethics institute \u2013 to finalise the model and get it ready to scale.",
      "This is the first time patients and non-academics have been invited to run a workshop at Brocher. It\u2019s a major step in making our platform work in the real world \u2013 with real safety, oversight, and support.",
      "We\u2019ve worked unpaid for over a decade to bring this idea to life \u2013 and we\u2019ve built the relationships, research base, and public support to take it to the next level.",
      "\u201cWe see great potential \u2013 and indeed necessity \u2013 in the vision behind Patient Powered Research.\u201d",

      "Upgraded from the first-gen 250W motor, the new 350W high speed geared brushless motor has enough pulling power to help you effortlessly conquer a 30\u00b0 incline. Brushless motors are smoother, more efficient, and generate no magnetic drag when riding the bike without any power.",

We hope that by using these bottled batteries, you can extend the amount of time you have for various activities, and also enjoy your usual cycling.\n\n* Extra batteries are not included in the standard perk. If you would like one, simply add it when you claim a perk.",

These protections help to achieve a smooth start to the vehicle and it is always consistent with the pedal action to achieve the effect of torque boost.",

I had literally flipped over and dumped out on more than one occasion when trying out other backpacking chairs. I couldn\u2019t stand that these other chairs would only ever be just a chair. I set out to design a chair that was ultralight, no, Adaptive Light, incredibly stable, supported my back, and didn\u2019t feel like I was sitting on the ground or squatting with my knees up to my chest.

      "That\u2019s why we, a couple of travel fanatics and road warriors, created TruRest, a unique, forward-leaning rest aid solution that supports your full body (not just the head and neck but also the chest), facilitating more comfort and deeper rest on your flights and beyond (think mini portable massage chair/table)!",
      "Don\u2019t just take our word for it!",
      "We consulted with doctors, studied body and breathing mechanics, and examined research while developing TruRest\u2019s patented ergonomic design. The natural and instinctive forward-leaning position promotes deeper, easier, and more efficient breathing by easing the workload of the chest muscles and engaging the diaphragm. This helps promote the relaxation response.",
      "At Hypnap, we know comfort isn\u2019t one-size-fits-all! That\u2019s why we made TruRest highly adjustable to fit a wide range of body heights, shapes and sizes.",
      "Take TruRest on any adventure!",
      "It\u2019s easy to set up, lightweight and portable. Plus, it folds into the footprint of an iPad\u2013perfect for traveling when you have limited space. TruRest is also TSA-approved, so you can easily pack it in your carry-on luggage!",
      "Hey, frequent flyers! \u2708\ufe0f Chloe, Co-Founder of TruRest, here.",
      "It turns out misery can be very inspiring!",
      "It all started on a flight I took from Singapore to the US. There was a problem with the airplane's hydraulics, and when all was said and done, I was seated on the airplane for 32 hours. I couldn\u2019t sleep sitting upright and getting comfortable in those cramped seats was impossible\u2014the best I could do was lean my head against the seat in front of me.",
      "Once I returned, I sketched ideas and built prototypes based on what I longed for on the flight\u2014something that would fully support my body and relieve muscle tension so that I could truly relax. My friend Darryl, a former computer programmer and frequent business traveler, thought it was a great idea and agreed to partner with me to develop and launch the product. We then partnered with industrial designers and engineers to help us further develop the design. Throughout the process, we consulted with doctors and other health professionals. We also examined medical research, body mechanics and ergonomics to ensure we developed a product that correctly supported the body, facilitated comfort and relaxation, and was safe to use.",
      "As the most trusted product launch company in the world, Enventys Partners has helped launch over 2,000 innovations with global sales of over $1 Billion for our clients.",
      "We utilize 20 years of experience in product development, prototyping, engineering, manufacturing, lead generation, crowdfunding campaign management, public relations, email marketing, and paid media marketing.",
      "Have an idea? We would love to help you launch it.",
      "We can\u2019t thank you enough for checking out our project and helping us make TruRest a reality.",
      "We know not everyone will be able to support us with a pledge, so even if you can\u2019t give a dollar or back TruRest, you can help us spread the word on Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Instagram and anywhere else you can think of!",

In a town known more for rain than sun we wanted to put our combined expertise (and love of sunshine) to use in creating a footwear brand aimed at all things travel. We have designed and developed shoes for many other brands for over 20 years, but this time we wanted to create our very own brand that would enable us to make footwear we felt we would all wear when we get away to sunnier places. Freestate is a shoe we have all had the chance to wear test over the last 12 months in all kinds of climates and conditions and it\u2019s a shoe we have all come to love.

      "Our mission to create the ultimate reusable bag was inspired by the tons of unnecessary single use plastic bags we received over the years.  After 7 successful campaigns and 64k+ fulfilled pledges, we're excited to share our latest creation with you:",
      "Ultra-light, ultra-strong, ultra-foldable. You won't believe how small these little premium bags pack. Designed to be both practical, comfortable and sturdy. These are convenient to carry in your pocket at all times and easily carries 66lbs (30kg).",
      "Here are the designs you can choose from",
      "The Nanobag 5.0 comes in five different bag styles",
      "Wouldn't it be nice to always have a comfortable bag handy?",
      "We consume somewhere between 1 trillion to 500 billion of plastic bags per year, and it\u2019s totally unnecessary. Reusable bags are great for the environment, but many are bulky, poor quality or uncomfortable to carry. Nanobag 5.0 is a premium shopping bag so compact that you won\u2019t even know you\u2019re carrying it. You don\u2019t even have to fold it. Our super-soft fabric naturally folds itself so easily that you can just put it in your pocket and it\u2019ll practically disappear.  It's also comfortable to use, thanks to our reinforced handles.",

The bags are made with premium custom made nylon polymer fabric and we've put in place a thorough quality-control and testing process to make sure you receive a great final product. We guarantee that your bags will be of excellent quality.",
      "We plant one tree for every bag sold",
      "We're 100% committed to making a climate positive product. That means that we give more back to the planet than we take. We already consider our bags environmentally conscious, as they contain less materials than other bags in their category and offset single use plastic bags. In addition, for each bag sold we\u2019ll plant one tree with Eden Reforestation. Trees are effective tools for removing carbon from the atmosphere. As an example, a mangrove tree can store up to 1750lbs (800kg) of CO2 over its growth life. As an added bonus trees also prevent soil erosion and help sustain ecosystems.",
      "We'll plant one tree for every bag sold with Eden Reforestation.",
      "Shipping",

This time we've managed to organize  EU friendly shipping (delivery duty paid) to the following countries: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, and Spain. All parcels will be shipped with tracked air mail.",

    "description": "Electric Stabilization | Preprogrammed Movement | Precise Speed Control | Smart Object Tracking",
    "company_name": "Snoppa Technology",
    "allParagraphs": [
      "Electric Stabilization | Preprogrammed Movement | Precise Speed Control | Smart Object Tracking",
      "Snoppa Rover is a revolutionary cinema dolly that has a electronic stabilization system for all terrain. It can drive and shoot stably and smoothly on various of uneven roads. Rover can be driven manually or move automatically along a preset path. With a load capacity of up to 15 kg (33 lbs) , a series of control interfaces, and an image transmission module, Snoppa Rover can load and control most of the popular cameras including mirrorless, DSLRs, cinema cameras etc., allowing you to remotely control both the dolly\u2019s movement and camera shooting, and live preview your shots through your phone or tablet.",
      "Rover integrates three wheels each with independent power control and steering system via three electric stabilizer arms. This uniquely isolates the body from wheel vibration and enables flexible motion control.",
      "Rover has built-in gyroscopes and acceleration sensors in each of its three stabilizer arms. These sensors detect the vibration of each wheel and the attitude of the whole vehicle at a frequency of 16Khz at all times. The detection frequency allows the high-torque motors to respond to disturbances within 0.06m/s. The motors output control feedback from a synchronous variable speed system, and with the added inherent elasticity of its springs Rover can maintain smoothness even when passing over uneven surfaces or obstacles.",
      "Thanks to the angle sensor (Hall sensor) at the joint between the stabilizer arm and the wheels of the Rover, the electric steering mechanism can be rotated 360. This provides flexible turning performance and allows for unconventional maneuvers such as zero-radius turns in place and hill-climbing with ease.",
      "All three wheels of Rover are equipped with individual power drives. The built-in gyroscope detects wheel speed in real-time, and the intelligent algorithm can distribute the power of each wheel individually. This results in smoother motion and more precise control of the Rover. Constant speed ramping greatly reduces wheel slippage or track deviation due to inconsistent wheel speed.",
      "Unlike vehicles with front-wheel steering - Rover's flexible turning performance makes it capable of keeping Rover\u2019s front end's direction unchanged under any path of movement. The direction of the cart is independent of the trajectory of movement. Shooting direction is not bound by the direction of movement. If the camera\u2019s direction of movement needs to be altered in the process of shooting, you do not need to consider turning radius to do a U-turn as Rover can be panned.",
      "Rover's unique electronic structure and design for each wheel give it adaptive steering control and dynamic power control. This provides the camera crew with maximum flexibility for camera movement.",
      "When repetitive work is required, you can run Rover's Pre-program Mode, which allows you to save pre-defined or used paths as templates. When you need to shoot this path repeatedly, you can directly pull out the template and reuse it. This allows you to quickly and accurately repeat your shots.",
      "In Orthogonal Mode, only Rover is allowed to move straight in vertical and horizontal directions. Usually used for Dolly in/out or Truck left/right movement effects.",
      "In Free Mode, the Rover is not restricted in any direction of movement. This mode is suitable for outdoor shooting or when the surface is complicated.",
      "In Arc Mode, Rover keeps the lens and the subject always equidistant, rotating one/half turn at the same rotation speed.",
      "In Lock Mode, whether you are manually or remotely manipulating the Rover's movement, the lens orientation will always remain the same.",
      "In Follow Mode, the lens will smoothly follow the movement of Rover. For use when a moving subject or a different subject needs to be shot, etc.",
      "In Target Mode, no matter how Rover moves, the subject is always in the center of the frame. This mode is only suitable for use when shooting fixed / still objects.",
      "When the need to track a person or a moving object arises during a shoot - Snoppa Rover's \" Smart Object Tracking \" will become the best member of your crew. For example, if you want to do a self-tracking shot, you don't need another crew member present to operate. You can leave it to Rover to perform the tracking while saving manpower. Smart tracking is much more convenient and accurate while capturing footage as opposed to manual control tracking shooting. Not only are you saving labor, money, and time - you are also able to get the exact shot you want, and can repeat it endlessly.",
      "A \u201cwalking hyper lapse\u201d requires a camera operator to walk at a specified interval. However, it is hard to guarantee the walking speed and stability of a person when a long and wide-range walk is required.",
      "Rover can easily move on a set path and at a set speed - including around corners and over bumps, bringing more creative freedom to your hyperlapse.",
      "With a minimum travel speed of 1 cm/s to 2 cm/s and a minimum bottom diameter of 60 cm, the Rover is able to ensure optimal passing on narrow roads.",
      "Rover has a moving speed up to 8m/s, and you can easily follow a fast-moving object to shoot.",
      "The versatility of the Rover gives you more possibilities for your shots.",
      "\u00b7 Three Expansion Levels",
      "\u00b7 Low Angle Shooting",
      "If low-angle shooting is required, you can hang the camera upside down at the bottom of the Rover's center pole to do low camera shots.",
      "\u00b7 Three Driving Methods",
      "\u00b7  Two Installation Methods",
      "We learned from the survey that was sent out last month that most users want the Rover to have an active obstacle avoidance function. In order to better meet your day-to-day shooting needs (and to protect Rover and your camera), an active obstacle avoidance feature will be added to Rover. A BIG thank you to everyone for providing feedback.",
      "When shooting in an indoor studio, perhaps you prefer to operate at close range - giving you more intuitive control over your shots. This is a Holder designed specifically for Rover that senses your hand's pressure output for real-time response, such as movement and rotation. This ensures that you enjoy stress-free and highly precise control even when operating manually.",
      "Rover provides a stable shooting platform that allows us to better move the camera and design the path of the lens in the shot. So how do you adjust the direction of the camera such as tilt during the shooting process? One way is to install a video tripod head on the Rover, so you can adjust the camera angle in real time and move the Rover manually and precisely by the handle. Another way to achieve camera angle control is by installing a stabilizer. We will launch a gimbal that can be used with the Rover in August. This gimbal can be programmed and controlled in conjunction with the Rover. Or you can provide and use your own stabilizer.",
      "\u00b7 Rover & Electric Tripod Head",
      "Polaris is a new released electronic tripod head from Benro. Rover has partnered with Benro to directly support Polaris to work together.  With Polaris, you can further control the pan and tilt of the camera, making the mobile shooting more flexible. For example, you can use this combination to shoot a hyper-lapse in ARC.",
      "Rover's software integrates Rover's controls, camera controls, and image previews into the same App, making it a fully functional wireless workbench. the Rover APP is available in both tablet and phone versions. The advantage of the tablet version is that it consolidates all the required actions on the same page, so you can perform your operations quickly without having to switch between different menus.",
      "Rover is more than just an electric cinema dolly. The perfect combination of powerful built-in hardware and AI technology ensures that you can easily preview camera footage while shooting. You can dial in ISO, WB, EV compensation, aperture, and shutter speed at the same time.",
      "Snoppa Rover has a capacity of up to 15kg (33.1 lbs), and can set up a wide range of popular mirrorless cameras, DSLRs, and cinema cameras like RED, ARRI in the market. The unique load adjustment knob on the dolly can be adjusted to adapt the equipment of various weights within 15kg to achieve the best matching.",
      "Snoppa Rover is equipped with a bunch of interfaces through which you can connect and control the camera by your phone or tablet.",
      "We designed Rover with two battery packs that operate in parallel to increase battery capacity. This means that if either pack runs out of power it can simply be replaced with a new one without delaying the shot in the progress as it always stays powered on. This design not only increases Rover\u2019s working duration, but also helps to conform to travel rules surrounding batteries - such as on airplanes.",
      "Rover not only can be quickly folded, but also has a very good design to have a travel grip to go easy for you to carry.",
      "Rover was designed from scratch, and during this process we have experienced more than a dozen cycles of \u201cdesign, push down, redesign\u201d. We have repeatedly tested more than 300 customized parts, and finally achieved the final features of Rover.",

      "Just plug your HumBug into a wall outlet anywhere you have an insect problem in your house and watch the HumBug go to work!",
      "The Humbug operates at 32khz-55khz creating auditory stress in most pests driving them away. Humans don't hear above 20khz with the exception being children hearing as high as 30khz making the HumBug silent and harmless. Cats & dogs hear frequencies between 22khz-25khz making it safe for your household pets.",
      "Here is a partial list of the pests that hear the frequencies of the HumBug:",
      "Talking with team of engineers we insisted that the Humbug was capable of working in almost every country.  All you have to do is back our project and based on the country we are shipping to we will make sure you have the correct plug type to work in your country. See Image below for available socket types. So where does the HumBug work?",
      "Just plug it into any existing wall socket and watch it go to work. You can expect to see results in as little as 7 days. The cost to operate each unit is approximately 20 cents USD per month when using it 24 hours a day. The total electrical draw on each unit is less than 2 watts.",
      "We relied heavily on feedback from actual users and made changes based on what they had to say. We are pleased to have reached a perfect 5 star rating from the actual users based on our final design.",
      "At the heart of the HumBug is our XT-33 extended range transducer which is designed to push our ultrasonic signal farther than the competition. Built of quality materials and components we are convinced that it's the best electronic pest repeller on the market. So convinced that we offer a 5 year no questions asked return policy. We are proud of our product and just as proud to stand behind it.",
      "Three years ago we set out to design a great looking and superior performing pest repeller... and to think that the initial design was created on a restaurant napkin!",

      "I spent the last 3 years carefully researching, developing and testing multiple iterations and prototypes to finally create the perfect balance of style, function, and durability. Here is the history...",
      "The Ama Backpack went through multiple sketches/cad concepts, 2 different size options, 2 exterior back colors, MANY MANY function tweaks, and 3 shape designs before finally reaching the final, perfected golden sample.",
      "The Quila bag started off as a rectangular bag that evolved into a circular shape in order to have a more stylish look and improved belt functionality. I created and tested 4 samples to get to the final prototype.",
      "I personally tested every single prototype, while receiving feedback from hundreds of people over the last 3 years. I brought each prototype out with me on a day-to-day basis to ensure that each feature was necessary and useful - making tweaks to the prototype as needed. Tweaks that involved better placement for use, and increasing the ease of the functions. I also brought each prototype out on countless travels, testing the TSA-compliant compartment at many airports domestically, and internationally to ensure the function worked perfectly...and it did. :)",
      "Here is a simple, unedited continuous take demo of the final sample of the Ama Backpack and Quila Bag.",
      "After 3 years of R&D, I am finally ready to bring the Ama Backpack and Quila Bag to life and in your hands, and I just need your help in funding the first round of production. With the golden samples ready to go and a trustworthy, quality manufacturer already secured, we are just around the corner from introducing the only two bags you need for all your work, travel, and leisure activities!",
      "The Kickstarter goal is the minimum amount needed to produce these two new bags. If we are to exceed our goal and hit stretch goals, additional funds will go toward producing NEW COLORS of the Ama Backpack and Quila Bag that will include backers' feedback and suggestions. Together we can create beautiful, functional bags for our modern-day lifestyles. :)",
      "As a solo, female entrepreneur, Stephanie Su first launched her line of premium and functional bags called Persu Collection on Kickstarter in 2015. Stephanie has a passion for designing functional yet sleek products while supporting and helping others to also \"Persu\" their dreams. She is an advocate of collaboration over competition, and a member of the latest cohort of female entrepreneurs in the F Project.",
      "\"After launching my first Kickstarter campaign in 2015, I was thrown into the fast-paced world of entrepreneurship. While constantly running from meeting to meeting, and traveling consistently domestically and internationally, I saw that there were two crucial bags missing from my collection: a backpack, and a small essentials-only bag. I needed a backpack that would make my travels easier, keep me organized, last for years to come (the ones I was using broke easily), and still maintain a sleek, clean exterior. And, I needed a smaller bag that could hold just my essentials, be versatile enough to transition from day to night, and allow me to be hands-free -without looking like a sporty fanny pack.",
      "So, I spent the last 3 years designing two bags that could solve all these problems: the Ama Backpack and the Quila Bag. With a TSA-complaint laptop pocket in the Ama and over 20 features, this backpack can withstand the hustle and assist in all of life's work, travel, and leisure activities. And, the Quila Crossbody Belt Bag can be worn 3 ways, depending on how you need it, eliminating the need for multiple bags - all without compromising style.\"",
      "-Stephanie Su, Founder + Designer of PERSU",
      "I designed these bags for the modern-day hustler (and am also one myself), so this time, I'm taking my Kickstarter challenge as an opportunity to increase my personal growth. I often find myself moving so quickly through life that I often neglect to give time to myself on a daily basis. So, for the 4-week run of my Kickstarter campaign, I will release a new #modernhustlerchallenge theme each week and hold myself accountable to follow-through on the activities. You will get all my #modernhustlerchallenge updates as a backer, and I'll include mini activities in case you would like to follow my challenge with me!",

      "Myself, My Dad (to my right), and his friends in Taiwan",
      "While I'm a solo entrepreneur, I could not have brought these bags and this project to life without the monumental help of these 5 people: My Dad, Devin Scott, Jane La Motte, Satomi Yuinawa, and Angie Steele. My team has collectively put in hundreds of hours to assist me in manufacturing, videography, post-production, graphic design, photography, and project coordination. Thank you for being part of this long and tedious process and helping me bring my vision to life!",
      "Some of you may be familiar with the first two bags I launched on Kickstarter in 2015 - the Tom and Jessica bags, named after my incredibly supportive parents. This time around, my two new bags are named after two equally important and extremely influential beings in my life.",
      "The Ama Backpack is named after none other than my amazing 94-year old grandmother who helped raise me from the day I was born. Ama (\u963f\u5abd) is what I call her and it means \u2018grandmother\u2019 in the Taiwanese dialect. Like many incredible grandmothers out there, my Ama is the strongest yet most selfless and caring person I know. After raising six kids alone in Taiwan, my Ama came to the US to help take care of her 3 grandchildren after their father passed at a young age. Shortly after, when I was born, Ama then came to our house every single day to care for myself and my two siblings. Ama communicated most with her actions due to speaking only Japanese and Taiwanese because of the Japanese Occupation of Taiwan in her childhood. We communicate in the only language we share, a limited version of Mandarin.",
      "She never had a lot in terms of wealth, but she gave everything she had to everyone others and dedicated her entire life to help and care for those around her. I'll never be able to come close to matching what she's given me with her love, patience, sacrifice, and care, but I dedicate this backpack to my Ama -  ready to withstand anything the world could throw at her, and do it with ultimate class.",
      "The Quila bag is dedicated to the partner in crime I had for half of my life: my chihuahua Tequila who passed away in March of 2018.",
      "Tequila (also nicknamed \"Quila\") was the first purchase I made after receiving my first paycheck at 16 years old and was the best thing to have ever entered my life. A small but confident little guy, he made home a home for me and was by my side through all the rough teenage years, the typical quarter-life crisis, and the rollercoaster ride of this entrepreneurship journey. He was by my side during the two weeks I was in the garage packing 800 bags from my first Kickstarter campaign in 2015. And, although he didn't make it to see the final prototypes of this one, he did see the making of it.",
      "So, I designed my new Crossbody Belt Bag in the spirit of Tequila. The lovely Quila is ready to be carried as a clutch or tucked under your arm as a shoulder bag, and can perform hands-free as a belt bag.",
      "I hope you\u2019ll feel as I do that these two new stylish and versatile bags are inspired by passion and the spirit of two truly incredible and amazing beings.",

      "The World's First Millionaire Timepieces and Multifunctional Tourbillon Watches,",
      "The word TOURBILLON was originally intended for French \"whirlwind\" or \"whirlpool\".",
      "Mr. Breguet",
      "The use of such natural phenomena for the first time in the use of timepieces is most likely related to the celestial movement of \"single axis rotation\" proposed by Rene Descartes and other philosophers.  From 2004 to 2005, Swiss watch manufacturers launched the tourbillon watch, which is the focus of the public.",
      "Tourbillons are included in some expensive modern watches as a novelty and demonstration of watchmaking virtuosity. The mechanism is usually exposed on the watch's face to show it off.",
      "The tourbillon is one of the most valued features of collectors' watches and premium timepieces, possibly for the same reason that mechanical watches fetch a much higher price than similar quartz watches that are much more accurate. High-quality tourbillon wristwatches, usually made by the Swiss luxury watch industry, are very expensive, and typically retail for tens of thousands of dollars or euros , with much higher prices in the hundreds of thousands of dollars or euros being common. A recent renaissance of interest in tourbillons has been met by the industry with increased availability of time pieces bearing the feature, with the result that prices for basic tourbillon models have receded somewhat in recent years (whereas previously they were very rare, in either antiques or new merchandise); however, any time piece that has a tourbillon will cost a great deal more than an equivalent piece without the feature.",
      "In a regular and balanced manner, the automatic machine core outputs a certain amount of energy, thus overcoming the influence of gravity on the mechanical table at different vertical positions.",
      "The practice of this principle is to install a CAGE structure in the core, which is loaded with three adjustment mechanisms; the escapement design, the hairspring and the balance wheel are called the tourbillon escapement.",
      "The tourbillon that rotates once every minute can send an average force at the same speed to eliminate the difference, so as to improve the accuracy of the neutral difference.  The core of the watch, like the engine of a car, the difference between the mechanical core and the tourbillon, like the difference between a general family car engine and the Formula 1 racing engine, not only the function is completely different, but the price difference between the two is even more  do not.",
      "Since the watch is not placed vertically for a long time, the tourbillon device has no effect on the watch as much as the watch, but the tourbillon device is extremely complicated, and the tourbillon becomes synonymous with the High-end watch because of the high production cost and process requirements.  Or even become an investment project).",
      "Why the Price of our tourbillon watch is affordable?",
      "Why our tourbillon watch could be sold in that affordable price, not because of the low costs of movement, low costs of the cases and other watch parts, the facts are explained belows.by skipping wholesalers , distributors and retail fees ,they offer luxury tourbillon timepieces for less than USD12,000",
      "If we send our watch to the street shop for selling, the price will be extremely high because of the above calculation, therefore our price shown in Kickstarter will never been seen in the street shops. Clear !",
      "Our ambition is to create our very own brand, which we can share with watch enthusiasts around the globe. Through \u201cViginti Octo\u201d, we are offering high-quality products with unique and exclusive designs comparable to watches at luxury brands, but at only a fraction of their retail price.",
      "We have spent over a year to prepare the launch of our product and had made tremendous improvements in order to achieve the best quality for our supporters. Every single piece of our product have been refined and improved during our research and development cycle, it is our greatest joy to bring the best quality product to our crowd funding customers.",

      "Kits with everything needed to grow a sun-hybrid moss lawn or garden that benefits the environment.",
      "Our company is The Moss Lawn, and our mission is simple: make lawns sustainable. And we\u2019re going to do it using moss. Why moss? Because moss requires no mowing, no watering, and no fertilizing. Not only does lawncare require a lot of your time and money, but it causes a lot of destruction to the environment. Fertilizing endangers our health and runs off into our local waterways, killing wildlife and causing massive deadzones. Watering lawns and gardens wastes billions of gallons of water each day, and lawn equipment is poorly regulated and contributes substantially to air pollution. Grass lawns also cause a lot of missed opportunity. Moss is incredibly low maintenance, and not only reduces pollution output, but its also extremely effective at controling erosion and filtering air and water pollutants from the environment.",
      "You don\u2019t have to tear up your whole lawn to be part of the moss movement. There are so many easy and beautiful ways to integrate moss into your landscape, like creating a beautiful rock garden, or creating a moss border to your lawn that controls erosion and keeps our waterways clean. At The Moss Lawn, we have everything you need. We\u2019ve spent years selecting and cultivating moss that shatters expectations. Our solar moss is versatile, lush, and sun tolerant. We\u2019ve also carefully studied and developed the best way to rapidly grow it through our kits, which combine a unique mix that minimizes watering needs and maximizes growth, and moss clusters. For those who want to join the movement but have spacial limitations, we have desktop gardens that are customizable using live moss and plants, and bring the beauty of the outdoors indoors. So join us in making lawncare sustainable and join the moss movement.",
      "HOW WE DO IT",
      "We have spent years developing the best method and means to grow a beautiful moss lawn or garden.",
      "There are over 20,000 species worldwide, and our Solar moss is local to only a couple of states in the US. We selected Solar moss based on several criteria- 1. Its height. Our moss averages 2-3\u201d tall - the same height of a perfectly mowed lawn. 2. Its sun tolerance - our moss can both flourish in shade and sun, and can sustain weeks of full sun and heat without dying, it will simply go dormant. 3. Its beauty. Solar moss resembles a carpet of mini trees with 1\u201d wide canopies. It is truly a stunning alternative to grass. 4. Its ability to handle foot traffic. You can walk all over your moss without damaging it. 5. Its fast growth. Solar moss is one of the fastest-growing species of moss, and can go from fragment to a full lawn in about 6 months.",
      "Second, we developed the growth practice.",
      "While Solar moss can tolerate drought and full sun, the best way to encourage growth is by protecting it from harsh elements. We've tackled moss\u2019s watering needs. While establishing, moss requires frequent light mistings (which is still much less than establishing or established grass). Conserving water is incredibly important to us, so we found the best way to grow moss without using excess water was the introduction of water retention gel to our fragments. We combine micro-Solar fragments and a gel that can hold hundreds of times its weight in water, which it then releases slowly back to the moss. This allows a constant water supply, without constant watering. Time your planting with rainfall, and you can go at least a week without watering.",
      "We also include comprehensive growing guides with all our kits. We stand by our growth practices, and implement them in all of our expansion.",
      "Third, we developed the business plan for continued growth.",
      "Moss cannot be stripped from its environment entirely, as it will hurt the local ecosystem and hurt rapid regrowth. We\u2019ve spent years acquiring and establishing moss on fertile land, and have introduced vertical growth via greenhouses, so that we can grow more moss per square foot of land. We also shuffle moss from full shade to full sun throughout its growth process.",
      "Not only is our mission and production plan sustainable, but so is our packaging. All of our packaging is made from recycled materials and is biodegradable. The box and packaging can be used as a weed barrier and to keep grass down, so you can place dirt and your moss materials on top of the packaging, and it will keep grass and weeds away while moss establishes.",
      "WHY MOSS?",
      "THE PRACTICAL BENEFITS",
      "No Watering",
      "Once established, moss is extremely drought tolerant, and can go months without water. Grass requires deep soakings of water multiple times a week to satisfy its deep root system.",
      "No Mowing",
      "Moss growth comes to a natural halt, with our moss averaging 2-3\u201d tall. Mowing will disrupt moss, although it grows well from fragments and will regrow to its natural maximum height if accidentally mowed. Lawns require frequent mowing to avoid rot, which leads to significant air pollution, as lawn and garden equipment remains widely unregulated.",
      "No Fertilizing",
      "Because it does not have a root system, moss pulls only minimally from its substrate, making fertilizing less effective. It instead gets its nutrients from rainfall and passing debris. Fertilizers used on grass run-off during rainfall into storm drains, polluting our waterways.",
      "THE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS",
      "Reduce Pollution & Improve Air Quality",
      "The World Health Organization estimates air pollution contributes to an estimated 7 million deaths annually, as well as a number of serious health problems. Mosses create some of the most efficient carbon sinks on the planet. What this means is that moss pulls carbon (a pollutant) from the air, and then uses it in photosynthesis and storage. When moss decomposes, the carbon is then sent into the soil. Moss can also filter particulate matter and nitrogen oxides from the air.",
      "Filter Water",
      "Research has found moss is powerful at removing biofilm, mold, fungus and other bacteria from water.  Moss filters for pools have become an increasingly popular alternative to chlorine.",
      "Control Erosion",
      "Moss as a ground cover works well at keeping the soil below it in place. Rainfall causes sediment to enter and pollute our waterways, causing harm to local ecosystems (similar to fertilizer runoff).",
      "Added Bonus: It's Beautiful",
      "OUR REWARDS",
      "Moss Buddy Digital Print - $1",
      "A digital thank with a Moss Buddy print. Our moss buddy prints are high-resolution pictures  of different animals and our moss that were taken during a promotional shoot to benefit a local non-profit animal rescue group.",
      "Moss Sampler - $10",
      "We\u2019re offering as our $10 tier a moss sampler that allows you to see in-person our three best selling mosses and their growing guides and specifications. This is to orient you with a variety of incredibly beautiful and hardy mosses.",
      "Moss Kits - $55, and $200",
      "Size: 50 sq. ft. kit ($55); 200 sq. ft. kit ($200)",
      "(Adorable mini panther not included)",
      "We\u2019re offering comprehensive kits that will get our beautiful Solar moss thriving in your lawn or garden as quickly as possible. All kits are sent with the following items, and include a detailed and personalized guide on how to use them.",
      "Solar Moss Clusters:",
      "We\u2019ve spent years studying moss, and provide you clusters of the perfect size and growth stage to rapidly reproduce and protect new growth. Our moss can tolerate extreme cold and heat.",
      "Water Retention Gel and Fragment mix:",
      "'",
      "When in the growth stage, moss requires frequent watering (once established, it\u2019s extremely drought tolerant). We use gel polymers that retain hundreds of times their weight in water, which is then slowly released back into the ground, providing consistent hydration to the growing moss. This allows for infrequent watering. These gel polymers are combined with micro Solar fragments, which act as seeds and lead to quicker growth.",
      "MOSS WALL:",
      "$95",
      "Our desktop moss walls are handcrafted and formed with our proprietary blend of cement, aggregate, colors, and techniques. This mix promotes live growth, and sustains frequent waterings and plant change-ups. Our walls are fully customizable, and a plant starter kit will be sent with each wall.",
      "Each wall measures approximately 7.5\"H x 7.5\"W x 3.75\"D",
      "Who we are, and more about our mission",
      "The Moss Lawn was created by myself and my mother in 2016 after using moss in our landscape for over a decade. Initially, we were drawn to its beauty and practical benefits - no mowing, watering, or fertilizing. But after learning about the grave environmental challenges we face, and how moss already plays a critical and massive roll in curbing global pollution, we became obsessed with moss and finding creative ways to use it - like with our ponds, walls, and pavers. So many people view moss as a weed - and they couldn't be more wrong. We've proven above and beyond that moss can create a stunning landscape, that is incredibly versatile - the entire look can be altered by the accompanying landscape, from a grass-type aesthetic, to that of a beautiful forest.",
      "The research is there - our earth can't sustain us forever as we are - and now is time to join the moss movement.",
      "By the way, did you notice a couple cute cats mixed in with our pictures? We founded an animal rescue group in 2017 that specializes in neonatal kittens, and we have saved hundreds of lives and found them forever homes. We also participate in and regularly fund local TNR initiatives. We are truly trying our best in every aspect of our lives to leave this earth a better place.",

      "CARDITION operates independently of the existing battery voltage and requires no additional power source. It maintains the manufacturer's recommended battery voltage at 100%, stabilizing the ECU and reducing the risk of electronic shock.",
      "CARDITION is a standalone, non-wired device that can be easily mounted and removed by anyone without the risk of installation errors. For optimal results, we recommend installing it in the location we suggest (attached to the + side of the battery).",
      "You can start experiencing performance improvements within 48 hours after installation, though this may vary depending on the vehicle's age and usage.",
      "For normal activation of the product, it may take up to 30 days, which includes the ECU learning period for each vehicle. (The time required may vary depending on the vehicle's condition.)",
      "CARDITION is compatible with all internal combustion vehicles powered by batteries, regardless of fuel type. Through tests on over 250 vehicles, including gasoline, diesel, LPG, and hybrid cars, we have confirmed performance improvements.",
      "To verify the harmlessness of the waves emitted by CARDITION, we conducted cesium tests, radon tests, radiation tests, radiation emission/detection tests, food safety tests, radionuclide analysis, and certified reference material tests in the country of manufacture. All tests confirmed that it poses no risk to human health.",
      "CARDITION's HDPE plastic case is made from the same material as baby bottles, offering durability that withstands high temperatures of up to 248\u00b0F and as low as -31\u00b0F without deformation, ensuring safe use. CARDITION solely functions to stabilize the current within the battery, without emitting any substances that could impair vehicle performance or interfere with its functions.",
      "We designed CARDITION in a compact, rectangular shape for easy installation on the battery. To ensure it blends seamlessly when installed in the vehicle, it features a matte black finish.",
      "To ensure proper functioning and prevent malfunction, please adhere to the following guidelines:",
      "The CARDITION case is made from HDPE plastic, the same eco-friendly material used in baby bottles that does not emit environmental hormones, and it is 100% recyclable.",
      "After establishing the research lab in 2013 and during the development of functional water and filters, we discovered that far-infrared wavelengths stimulate electrons. This discovery led us to research and develop a product that applies pure Far-infrared wavelengths to automotive batteries to enhance vehicle functionality. Over the past decade, we have conducted extensive testing on more than 250 vehicles, including far-infrared wavelength, material, and toxicity tests. This rigorous process has led to the development of a highly effective product for enhancing vehicle performance, which we are excited to officially launch in 2024.",
      "EROPGEHADA INC. is a company that researches and develops eco-energy and renewable energy. We have been conducting research since 2013 and have developed a device that stabilizes the voltage and current of automobile batteries by utilizing the far-infrared wavelength of energy extracted from Illite, thereby stabilizing automobile output, vibration, and noise. We are going to present our groundbreaking technology by introducing CADITION for the first time on Indiegogo. Starting with this campaign, we want to research new technologies that can be applied to more vehicles. We wantIndiegogosupporters to be the first to experience the amazing effects of CARDITION and hear various feedback. We need your love and support for our successful overseas expansion.",

    "title": "BEKAN: The Intelligent Anti-Theft Bike Light",
    "description": "Motion Sensor | Braking Light | Anti-Theft | Accelerometer |  Waterproof | Beautiful.",
    "company_name": "Jack O'Sullivan",
    "allParagraphs": [
      "Motion Sensor | Braking Light | Anti-Theft | Accelerometer | Waterproof | Beautiful.",
      "IT'S TIME FOR A BETTER BIKE LIGHT",
      "One of the most frustrating and expensive issues we repeatedly hear from other cyclists is the issue of bike light theft. No matter how you attach them or where you leave your bike, they can be spotted and stolen before you know it.",
      "If you\u2019re lucky enough to not have your lights stolen, they are often clunky looking and easily damaged due to their exterior placement. Looking into things a little more, we noticed that there wasn't much innovation happening in bike lighting. We thought it was time that there was, and set about creating a bike light that was smarter, stronger and more secure\u2026",
      "THE TAIL-LIGHT THAT'S GOT YOUR BACK",
      "As bicycles and cities get smarter, we wanted to ensure that Bekan could keep up with and exceed the needs of modern cyclists. That meant going back to the board, literally. It holds more than 20 COB LED\u2019s, motion sensors, accelerometers, a battery management system and more. We then sealed everything within a weather-resistant housing for maximum protection.",
      "MOTION SENSOR",
      "Bekan is always thinking, which means it's aware whether you're riding or not. Anytime you stop to take a rest from the road; the motion sensor will automatically switch Bekan off after 3 minutes to reserve energy. And when you're on the move, it switches Bekan back on. All you have to do is fit and forget.",
      "AUTOMATIC BRAKE LIGHT",
      "The more other road users have an idea of what you're doing, the less likely there's a chance of an accident happening. Bekan uses an accelerometer, so it knows when you're slowing down, and responds smartly by activating a braking mode. This turns the flashing into a solid full-beam, alerting drivers and riders when you're coming to a stop.",
      "WEATHER-RESISTANT PROTECTION",
      "Picture it, beautiful blue skies for miles and not a cloud in the sky. It's a perfect day to ride. Until you start your journey, and it begins to rain. Thankfully, not a problem for Bekan because all of its intelligent features are protected within a sealed weather-resistant housing. Even if it rains, Bekan shines.",
      "MAGNETIC CHARGING",
      "Like everything else with Bekan, charging has been designed with ease and convenience in mind. When it\u2019s time for a top-up, simply connect the magnetic cable and get up to a month of ride time from a single charge. What\u2019s more, the cable also gives you access to all the latest Bekan firmware updates.",
      "180\u00b0 OF VISIBILITY",
      "Not all tail lights are created equal, far from it. Unlike some traditional tail lights that are clunky and not so easy on the eye, Bekan combines stunning style with gritty urban toughness. And it all starts with its distinctive matrix beam design. This unique feature was created using advanced computer-controlled micro-drilling that produce 2mm holes. This allows light to flood through for 180\u00b0 of visibility.",
      "Two screws. One simple way to install. You don\u2019t need to do the math to know that installing the Bekan is a breeze. Just take out your current seat post, swap your saddle onto Bekan and, you\u2019re ready to ride.",
      "ULTRA-BRIGHT LEDS",
      "CLICK TO CONTROL",
      "Everything about the Bekan is designed to just work. No hassle and certainly no fuss. With the master power button, all of Bekan\u2019s impressive features are at your fingertips. One press turns Bekan on standby for motion detection, press again for always on and, press a third time and it's lights out.",
      "Available in: 25.4mm, 27.2mm, 30.9mm, and 31.8mm.",
      "In our experience, one size doesn\u2019t fit all. That\u2019s why Bekan is available in four of the most common sizes: 25.4mm, 27.2mm, 30.9mm, and 31.8mm. There's 3 easy ways to check what size you need. 1) You can measure the inside diameter of your seat tube. 2) Measure the diameter of your old seat post. 3) Google it!",
      "So whether you\u2019re treating yourself to a new bike or sticking with an old favourite, there\u2019s a Bekan made just for you.",
      "SEAMLESS ADJUSTMENT",
      "Whether you're sitting tall or have more of a low profile, your riding position is as unique to you as your fingerprint. With Bekan's seamless styling and uncluttered finish, you have unlimited flexibility to adjust the height of Bekan precisely the way you like it.",
      "Our thoughtful packaging design enables the cardboard lid to be turned 180 degrees, giving an On/Off effect.",
      "Each box contains the following:",
      "x1 Bekan Tail Light - In a size of your choice",
      "x1 Magnetic Charging Cable",
      "x1 Instruction Leaflet",
      "Hi, we\u2019re Modmo! What\u2019s Modmo? Well, it\u2019s a portmanteau of MODULAR and MOBILITY. From the very beginning, our passion for cycling and sustainability has been at the core of a singular vision to build an electric bicycle that can replace your car.",
      "As we design and develop towards that dream, we\u2019ve had quite a few micro innovations along the way, and Bekan is just one of them. The hours and energy we\u2019ve put into creating Bekan have been many, but it has been worth every second. We genuinely believe that it is the essential rear bike lighting system for brighter and safer riding experience. And with your support and backing, we hope to make it a tremendous success that we can experience together.",
      "Modmo was founded by, then 21-year-old, Jack O\u2019Sullivan from Ireland. After starting his first bicycle company at age 17, Jack felt there was no middle-ground between being a sweaty cyclist and a frustrated driver sitting in traffic. Jack wanted to create the bike that would replace your car for urban mobility.",
      "After a year of slow progress in Ireland, Jack packed his bags and took a trip around Taiwan and China to find the perfect factory. After a month of meetings (and too much Karaoke), Jack realised a traditional bicycle factory wouldn't be up to the standard of Modmo. After a spur-of-the-moment trip to a high-tech motorbike factory in Vietnam, Jack knew this is where Modmo would come to life and he hasn't left since.",
      "Ton is Vietnamese and comes with years of experience in mechanical engineering and designing IOT devices. After spending months working part-time on weekends, Ton quit his job to join Modmo full-time and now leads engineering and manufacturing.",
      "Phu joined us part-time to develop and optimise the PCB(Printed Circuit Board), which links all the components together and, Trung wrote and tested the firmware to give Bekan it's functionality.",
      "Although this is our first Indiegogo project, each member of the Modmo team is highly experienced in their field, and has brought their skills and passion to help get the Bekan where it is today. We have been developing and extensively testing a series of prototypes, and now have an advanced version of Bekan that is almost ready to go into full production. Our full team is living and working in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam where we are also able to manufacture almost every part of Bekan so we hope to be able to solve any manufacturing issues very quickly. However, as with any manufacturing endeavour, there are some challenges that we may not forsee. The main risks that we have identified are based around mass manufacturing and the need to produce the moulds and tooling which can be time consuming due to their need of extreme accuracy. CE and ROHS certification testing could delay shipping if there are issues.",
      "We pride ourselves on quality control, but it does take time. That being said, we're confident that we can resolve these issues with our manufacturing partners, and have Bekan ready in time for shipping. Please be reassured that we will provide regular updates to all our backers and be totally transparent across all communications.",

      "Crafted from the finest materials, this knife features a titanium alloy handle paired with an M390 high-performance blade, ensuring unparalleled durability and precision in every cut. What sets it apart is the meticulously designed hollowed-out handle, resembling the elegance of dragon bones\u2014a testament to the intricate artistry involved. This makes it not just a tool but a masterpiece in its own right.",
      "Functionality knows no bounds with the Dragon Ridge Knife. It offers three opening methods\u2014flipper, thumb hole, and button lock\u2014catering to diverse user preferences while ensuring safety. The button lock also serves as a secure lock when the knife is open, enhancing its reliability during use. The deep carry clip, not just robust but intricately patterned with scales reminiscent of the overall dragon-inspired design, adds both resilience and sophistication. For added convenience, we've thoughtfully included a keychain hole, allowing you to attach a lanyard for easier access and stylish customization.",
      "The Dragon Ridge Knife transcends the conventional notion of a mere tool; it's an artistic statement blending unparalleled craftsmanship with everyday usability. Whether you're preparing meals in the great outdoors, handling everyday cutting tasks, or adding it to your collection, the Dragon Ridge Knife is your indispensable choice.",
      "We created the Dragon Ridge Knife with several goals in mind:",
      "Breaking the Mold: The market is flooded with knives that look alike, primarily because of the limitations in titanium alloy precision machining. To cut costs, most knives feature solid handles. We wanted to break this barrier by incorporating large-scale hollowed designs to reduce weight while ensuring the knife remains strong and light, making it easy to carry. We used very small milling tools to carve intricate details, making the handle's fine details truly exquisite. Additionally, we incorporated embossing on the handle to enhance the knife's overall texture and dimensionality, which is more complex and time-consuming than standard processing methods. Paired with a high-performance M390 blade, this knife is truly made for both use and collection.",
      "Inspired by the Dragon Skeleton: The hollow shape of the entire knife body resembles a dragon's bones, with a scale-like design on the back clip, adding to its aesthetic appeal.",
      "Practicality for Outdoor Use: Our work often takes us outdoors, and a knife like this is incredibly practical. It can serve as a kitchen knife for cutting meat and vegetables and can also handle tough materials.",
      "These reasons led to the birth of the Dragon Ridge Knife.",
      "The Dragon Ridge knife is designed with versatility and portability in mind. Its compact size makes it easy to carry and use anywhere. Whether you\u2019re exploring the outdoors, tackling tasks at home, or adding it to your everyday carry, its sleek design fits seamlessly into your lifestyle. Despite its small footprint, The Dragon Ridge knife delivers uncompromising performance and reliability, making it the perfect companion for both rugged outdoor adventures and daily utility tasks.",
      "Our knife handle is crafted from high-grade GR5 titanium alloy, renowned for its exceptional strength, durability, and lightweight properties. This ensures a sturdy grip and a long-lasting tool that won\u2019t weigh you down during your outdoor adventures. The titanium handle isn\u2019t just about resilience; its sleek, modern aesthetic makes it a pleasure to use and a conversation starter among your peers.",
      "At the core of the Dragon Ridge Knife lies its unparalleled strength and resilience, courtesy of the GR5 Titanium frame. This aerospace-grade material ensures a robust structure with a remarkable strength-to-weight ratio, providing reliability without compromising performance. The titanium alloy's natural corrosion resistance keeps the knife in pristine condition with minimal maintenance, blending functionality and sophistication seamlessly.",
      "The Dragon Ridge features an M390 steel blade, renowned for its superior edge retention, corrosion resistance, and exceptional sharpness. This premium steel ensures precise cuts, making your utility knife experience seamless. Whether slicing vegetables, cutting meat, or handling tough materials, the M390 blade maintains its edge longer than traditional blades.",
      "We chose M390 steel to achieve the pinnacle of craftsmanship. Creating a titanium knife with a hollowed-out design is costly and complex, but we embraced this challenge to produce a knife that is both functional and collectible. M390's hardness and resilience ensure lasting sharpness for precise cuts every time.",
      "M390 steel outperforms D2 in wear and corrosion resistance, keeping the knife sharp and reliable even under demanding conditions. Its superior edge retention means less frequent sharpening, and its high chromium content offers excellent stain resistance. While D2 is durable, it requires more maintenance and is more prone to corrosion.",
      "By choosing M390, The Dragon Ridge ensures top-tier performance, durability, and ease of maintenance, making it the ultimate choice for a versatile and reliable cutting tool.",
      "The Dragon Ridge stands out with its minimalist appearance, exuding an understated elegance that speaks volumes. Its design philosophy revolves around simplicity and sophistication, where every detail serves a purpose, resulting in an uncluttered yet strikingly beautiful look. The titanium handle, with its intricate hollowed-out structure, adds depth and character while maintaining a subtle charm.",
      "This minimalist allure not only highlights the knife's aesthetic appeal but also ensures a comfortable grip and effortless usability in various daily tasks. It seamlessly blends artful simplicity with functional excellence, showcasing the power of minimalist design in enhancing both form and function.",
      "The Dragon Ridge Knife is designed with three different opening mechanisms to provide effortless accessibility and ease of use in any situation. These methods include the thumb hole opening, flipper opening, and button lock opening, each offering a unique and intuitive experience.",
      "Thumb Hole Opening: The thumb hole opening allows for smooth, one-handed deployment of the blade with a simple thumb push, ensuring precision and efficiency in every use.",
      "Flipper Opening: The flipper opening mechanism enhances ease of use, enabling rapid, one-handed access to the blade. A quick flick of the finger smoothly springs the blade into action, ready to tackle any task with precision.",
      "Button Lock Opening: The button lock opening adds an extra layer of convenience and safety. With a press of the button, the blade is securely released, ensuring a swift and reliable opening method. The button lock also ensures that the blade remains firmly in place during use, preventing accidental closures that could potentially cause harm. This innovative locking mechanism provides peace of mind, allowing you to focus on the task at hand without worrying about the blade accidentally closing.",
      "The ergonomic design and smooth operation of these opening mechanisms make The Dragon Ridge Knife not only convenient but also safe, catering to the need for rapid, on-the-go functionality.",
      "The Dragon Ridge features roller bearings that provide smooth, one-handed deployment and effortless opening and closing.

The incorporation of roller bearings not only enhances the knife's ease of use but also improves its durability and long-term performance. Experience the seamless action and long-lasting reliability of The Dragon Ridge with its precision-engineered roller bearings.",
      "The Dragon Ridge Knife is designed primarily as a versatile utility knife, perfectly suited for a wide range of everyday cutting tasks.

This makes it an invaluable addition to your everyday carry (EDC) kit, car, backpack, or toolbox, ensuring you're always prepared for any situation.",
      "In addition to its primary function as a utility knife, The Dragon Ridge Knife excels as an outdoor kitchen companion and a versatile indoor tool. Its robust construction and compact size make it perfect for preparing meals in the great outdoors, effortlessly slicing through fruits, vegetables, and other ingredients. When used indoors, it transitions seamlessly to handling kitchen tasks, proving itself indispensable for all your culinary needs.",
      "With The Dragon Ridge Knife, you have a reliable and efficient tool that adapts to any scenario, offering unmatched versatility and performance for both everyday tasks and culinary adventures.",
      "The deep carry clip is designed for discreet and convenient everyday carry, ensuring the knife stays securely and subtly by your side. It allows the knife to sit low in your pocket or backpack for enhanced concealment. Its ability to effortlessly slide into and out of the pocket makes The Dragon Ridge Knife an ideal choice for those seeking a balance between accessibility and discretion in their daily carry.",
      "We've also incorporated a lanyard hole on the knife frame, allowing you to attach a stylish EDC lanyard bead. This not only accessorizes your gear but also improves grip during use, especially for EDC tools. Experience the seamless integration of convenience and subtlety with the lanyard hole, making the The dragon ridge knife a reliable and discreet companion for your everyday adventures.",

Built-in safety features include thermal, voltage, and current protection, plus a magnetic leash that shuts off the motor if you fall. Our dual-circuit system keeps charging and riding separate, and the battery mounts securely without tools. Fast charging (~2 hours) gets you back on the water quickly.",
      "Propel\u2019s QuietJet\u2122 propulsion system delivers up to 10kW of FOC-controlled thrust for buttery-smooth acceleration and speeds up to 25 mph (40 km/h) in eFoil mode. In thruster-powered E-Scooter, E-SUP, and Jet Kart\u2122 modes, riders cruise comfortably between 6\u201312 mph (10\u201320 km/h) with stable, intuitive control. A dual-purpose wireless remote with multiple throttle profiles lets riders start slow and unlock power as they progress, while the QuietJet\u2122 thruster adds vector steering for precise directional control. Beneath it all, a hydrodynamically optimized foil system and CFD-tested Kort Nozzle Jet Drive maximize thrust and efficiency, with fully enclosed, ducted designs that protect riders and marine life. Every component is built for real-world durability \u2014 from reinforced electronics to saltwater-rated, IP67\u2013IP68 waterproof materials.",
      "Propel isn\u2019t just another electric watercraft \u2014 it\u2019s a complete 5-in-1 system built for maximum versatility, beginner-friendly access, and unbeatable value. While other brands limit you to one or two modes, Propel delivers five, with fast, tool-free setup, a portable inflatable design, and even Jet Kart\u2122 mode for seated fun. You get longer battery life, better portability, and the freedom to ride however you want \u2014 all in one package.",
      "Propel is for anyone and everyone who loves the water or just wants to experience something truly new. We\u2019ve seen kids, parents, and even grandparents light up during our test rides. Our mission is simple: remove the barriers and let you ride your way. As founder Jason says, \u201cThe thrill of riding should be accessible, safe, and fun for everyone.\u201d Propel delivers exactly that.",

We handed them the board, let them ride, and then asked: \u201cHow was it?\u201d This was truly their first time ever riding the product \u2014 no practice runs, no rehearsals.

      "Don\u2019t let the size or inflatable design fool you \u2014 Propel boards are engineered for performance, with ultra-light swing weight that makes them incredibly agile and responsive on the water. Thanks to cutting-edge drop-stitch technology, they deliver stiffness, control, and ride feel on par with hard carbon fiber boards, breaking the old stigma that inflatables aren\u2019t high-performance. We\u2019ve pioneered a unique inflatable V-hull, shaped for smooth water release and clean touchdowns, enhanced by a rear water separation edge that reduces drag for more efficient lift.\n\n*Note: Final production boards will include full Propel graphics (not white). See renders below:",
      "Whether you want maximum stability or nimble precision, there\u2019s a perfect board for your style. The Pathfinder is our most stable, beginner-friendly platform, ideal for E-Scooter, E-SUP, Scooter-eFoil, and Jet Kart\u2122 modes \u2014 anyone can hop on and ride comfortably. The Navigator is its agile sibling, blending stability with sharper handling for progressing riders. For pure E-Foil performance, the Glider is our smallest, most responsive board, with concentrated underfoot weight and a feather-light feel, unmatched in agility and control (not recommended for handlebar use). With strategic D-rings, soft silicone handles, and an optimized rocker profile, Propel\u2019s inflatable boards prove you don\u2019t need carbon to perform \u2014 just smart, purposeful design.",
      "With a unique inflatable V-Hull design (for better tracking and smoother directional control) and a reinforced PVC dropstitch hull paired with an EPP foam core + aluminum chassis, this board is engineered for durability and performance. At the rear, an integrated water separation edge reduces suction, letting the board release cleanly from the water for easier lift-offs and touchdowns. Add in the custom EVA deck pad and super-comfy silicone handles, and you get a compact, travel-ready platform that\u2019s both rugged and refined.",
      "Meet QuietJet\u2122 \u2014 our fully enclosed, safe jet propulsion system. With no exposed blades, a low-maintenance design, and ultra-efficient thrust, it delivers smooth, powerful acceleration across all modes while keeping riders, wildlife, and equipment safe. Backed by ~10 kW peak power, CFD-optimized Kort Nozzle engineering, and a whisper-quiet FOC-controlled motor, QuietJet\u2122 offers top speeds up to 25 mph (40 km/h) in eFoil mode and 12 mph (20 km/h) in thruster modes \u2014 with passive water cooling, reverse thrust, and optimized efficiency at ~22 km/h for longer ride times.",
      "Propel\u2019s padded, angle & height adjustable handlebar gives riders extra stability and control, with multiple adjustment points to fit various heights and riding styles. It\u2019s fully removable when you want a free-glide foil experience and mounts tool-free with a secure quick-connect system. With integrated remote placement and tilt-assist steering (for E-SUP and Jet Kart\u2122 modes), it\u2019s designed to make every ride feel smooth, intuitive, and confident.",
      "Propel\u2019s hydrofoil system features a lightweight 6061-T6 aircraft-grade aluminum mast and durable glass-fiber composite wings, delivering balanced performance and durability. The adjustable rear shim angle lets you fine-tune for rider weight and balance, while the high-lift front wing ensures smooth, easy takeoff at low speeds. With a tool-free slide-in mounting system and optional future wing swaps for performance tuning, Propel\u2019s foil system is optimized for lift, stability, and effortless transitions on the water.",
      "Propel\u2019s entire system \u2014 from the Smart BMS battery and chassis to the remote, motor, and electronics \u2014 is fully IP67/IP68 rated for marine use. Every exposed component is sealed, coated, or reinforced to handle splashes, salt spray, and wet environments with confidence. The 50.4V / 50Ah Smart BMS battery features advanced thermal, voltage, and current protection, plus a tethered magnetic auto-shutoff leash and dual charging circuits for safe, reliable performance. Its quick-lock design drops securely into the chassis without tools, delivering up to 3 hours* of ride time and fast (~2-hour) recharge cycles.",
      "*Based on E-Foil mode with 1800 foil wing and ~170 lb rider in calm water conditions.",

      "Propel began with a simple question: \u201cHow do we bring the freedom and thrill of foiling to everyone?\u201d",
      "Founder Jason Toth, former pro snowboarder (Burton, Volcom, Oakley) and lifelong board sports addict, fell in love with foiling five years ago \u2014 and never looked back. It feels like snowboarding on powder: smooth, weightless, and deeply addictive. A glide that resets your brain and reconnects you to nature. Jason is fluent across all foil disciplines \u2014 prone foiling, wing foiling, para-wing, downwind, wake, tow, and e-foiling \u2014 and has become passionately dedicated to sharing the freedom, thrill, and joy of getting people out on the water and playing.",
      "But when Jason tried to share that joy, he hit the same wall again and again: \u201cIt looks amazing\u2026 but I could never do that.\u201d  Too many boards. Too much setup. Too many barriers.",
      "So he asked: What if one watercraft could carry someone from first glide to full flight \u2014 without making them feel like a beginner?",
      "That spark became a mission. That mission became a system. And that system became Propel:\na 5-in-1 modular watercraft that adapts to the rider \u2014 not the other way around.",
      "Backed by 20+ years of design, manufacturing, and production expertise. We built Propel to be more than fun. We built it to be inviting.",
      "One craft. Five modes.\nNo tools. No confusion. No Stress.\nJust a watercraft that makes everyone say: \u201cI want to ride.\u201d",
      "Jason teamed up with a small but mighty team of engineers and designers who shared his passion. Together, they sketched out a multi-mode watercraft concept and got to work. After over two years of R&D, that idea became the 5-in-1 electric watercraft system we\u2019re introducing today. We built prototype after prototype, testing in oceans, lakes, and pools, refining every detail. We added inflatable elements for stability, plug-and-play connectors for ease, and a jet drive for safety. There were late nights in the workshop and early mornings on the water \u2014 we\u2019ve got the scarred shins and epoxy stains to prove it! But the real proof was when first-time riders hopped on and were gliding within minutes. That\u2019s when we knew we\u2019d created something truly special. This isn\u2019t just a product \u2014 it\u2019s a new way to share the thrill of riding with everyone you love.",
      "To bring Propel to life at the highest quality, we partnered with the best manufacturers in the business. GP87 Inc., led by a former Formula 1 engineer turned CEO MJ. They helped us to refine the hydrodynamics and ensure the design is ready for scaled manufacturing. And surf legend John \u201cBosch\u201d Atkins of Blue Sea Watersports lent his 50+ years of board-shaping expertise to perfect the ride feel and durability. With their help, we\u2019ve taken Propel from a garage project to a production-ready reality. Our prototypes are already conquering waves and turns in real-world tests, and the results are thrilling.",
      "And the Team Behind the Scenes",
      "Propel is backed by a dedicated team of in-house and external experts \u2014 from industrial designers and software engineers to operations specialists and specialized manufacturing partners.",
      "Together, we\u2019ve worked through every detail to bring this innovative 5-in-1 watercraft to life, all driven by one shared goal: delivering an exceptional product to our backers.",
      "We\u2019ve been hands-on from day one \u2014 testing, refining, and obsessing over the experience to ensure it delivers not just performance, but something truly unforgettable.",
      "We\u2019re all in \u2014 and we can\u2019t wait to get this in your hands.",
      "At our core, we\u2019re a team of adventurers and dreamers. We believe time on the water is pure magic \u2014 a blend of freedom, excitement, and Zen all at once. We believe everyone deserves to experience that magic. Our mission is to redefine personal watercraft to make it more inclusive, more versatile, and more fun than ever before. Propel isn\u2019t just another product launch \u2014 it\u2019s the start of a movement to break down barriers in water sports. When you back Propel, you\u2019re joining that mission. You\u2019re helping a small team of passionate builders and riders share the stoke of \u201ceverybody flies\u201d with the world.",
      "We\u2019ve spent the past two years building, testing, and refining every part of Propel \u2014 and now we\u2019re ready to move from prototype to production.",
      "\u2714 Working beta prototypes completed and featured in our campaign videos\n\u2714 Battery, jet drive, and modular systems tested and validated in real-world conditions\n\u2714 Branding and board graphics finalized, with sample units produced\n\u2714 Supplier and manufacturing partnerships secured\n\u2714 Test rides with first-time users, families, and pros \u2014 all delivering overwhelmingly positive feedback (the riders you see in the video were testing for the very first time!)",
      "Next step: As soon as the campaign closes, we lock final tooling and begin production sampling to bring Propel to life for our backers.",
      "We believe transparency is key \u2014 especially when you\u2019re backing a campaign like this. We\u2019ve clocked countless ride sessions on our pre-production units, pushing every part to perform, improve, and impress. From the battery, motor, and ESC to the inflatable chassis, we\u2019ve tested and refined it all through hands-on trials, including:",
      "\u2705 Saltwater exposure and corrosion testing\n\u2705 Drop and impact durability checks\n\u2705 Beginner trials with riders aged 15 to 70\n\u2705 Real-world testing for foil lift, stability, and ride handling",
      "We\u2019re not starting from scratch \u2014 Propel is production-ready, and this campaign is your chance to join early and ride a system that\u2019s already been proven in real-world action.",
      "We\u2019re committed to keeping everything transparent \u2014 including shipping and taxes \u2014 so there are no surprises later. Our goal: deliver safely, affordably, and on time. We\u2019re committed to keeping things transparent, here\u2019s exactly how it works.",
      "Shipping is not included in your pledge. To simplify fulfillment and avoid delays later, we collect a $1,000 shipping deposit at checkout.",
      "Once your Propel is ready to ship, we\u2019ll calculate the actual cost based on your delivery address and chosen method:",
      "Why a deposit? Propel is a large-format, high-value electric watercraft with a lithium battery, Jet Kart\u2122 hull, foil system, inflatable board, and modular parts. Shipping costs can vary significantly by country, season, and fuel prices \u2014 this deposit gives us the flexibility to offer the safest, most cost-efficient delivery method available for your region.",
      "You\u2019ll confirm your shipping details via a post-campaign survey and receive full tracking once your order ships.",
      "Due to the size and value of Propel \u2014 including a large-capacity battery, inflatable boards, foils, jet systems, chassis, and travel gear \u2014 shipping involves three large, heavy packages: one battery (classified as hazardous goods, requiring special handling) and two oversized boxes with the board, foil systems, motors, chassis, and accessories.",
      "While the total door-to-door shipping cost may seem high at first glance, it typically breaks down to about $400 per package depending on destination \u2014 a fair reflection of the size, weight, and special handling required.",
      "We\u2019re actively working to reduce costs by negotiating preferred carrier rates, using bulk container shipments to major continents, and partnering with fulfillment centers for efficient final delivery. While global rates can be unpredictable, we\u2019re fully committed to keeping backer shipping costs as low and fair as possible and will pass along any savings we negotiate..",
      "Propel is a next-generation watercraft \u2014 and like many hardware products, it may be subject to import duties or VAT depending on your country\u2019s regulations.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know:\n\u2714 Tariffs and taxes are not included in your Indiegogo pledge or shipping cost. These charges are collected separately by your country\u2019s customs agency at the time of delivery.\n\u2714 Rates vary by country and may depend on factors such as total value, product classification, and shipping method. Please consult your local import rules for electric recreational equipment.\n\u2714 Special note for USA backers \u2014 We\u2019re monitoring the tariff landscape closely.

      "The open weaves maximize surface exposure for airflow. BREATHABILITY guaranteed.",
      "A dry towel is a clean towel. The airy waffles effectively prevent the multiplication of odor caused by bacteria and fungus. You will never reach out to a wet, musty towel after a shower anymore.",
      "While the waffle structure intrinsically maximizes surface exposure for airflow for guaranteed breathability, allowing the towel to dry itself out quickly, we have fundamentally improved the performance of Kosmu Towel with advanced science and technology.",
      "Kosmu Towel employs an advanced spinning technology that can store air across the cotton threads. Dissolving the pre-woven hydrosoluble fibers enveloped by cotton, Aerocore Technology\u00ae helps create tubular cotton fibers, making for 160% higher water absorbency, 2X speed to dry, 70% Less shedding rate than the industry standard.",
      "Kosmu towel is crafted of the actual world\u2019s most optimized innovation of towel fabrics, a combination of 70% of extra fine cotton (with an extremely long fiber length of 37mm and a world-best 48.3 g/.tex fibers strength) and 30% premium natural silk ( 25 MM and 3.5CN/d).",

It provides both assurance and quality in all its products at prices that meet customer needs by full management of product quality in all states of the manufacturing process.",
      "Over a year ago we began an ambitious journey to transform the way we refresh ourselves in our bathroom. When we take it for granted that it is the bath itself that recharges us, we find out that the daily ritual after your bath actually plays a much more significant role. In this ritual, you are with your bath towel, as always.",
      "However, the towel industry has not really changed across the past century. We are still in the restless journey of searching for the right bath towel, facing an ocean of towels with unequal and hard-to-expect qualities.",
      "Kosmu is changing the picture by tackling the \u201cTowel Dilemma\u201d with science. Voluminousness and quick-dry are not necessarily contradictory. After many studies, design iterations, and prototypes, we finally create the waffle-shaped cotton-silk towel which solves the \u201cTowel Dilemma\u201d with design, technology, and material innovation.",

      "How clean is your home really? Does it smell or feel stuffy sometimes? You've probably experienced foul odors at some point in your house. PURRAIR has been created to solve those problems most effectively and efficiently. Discover the life-changing magic of PURRAIR!",
      "Why choose PURRAIR over other products in the market? Unlike the other existing air purifiers, PURRAIR is permanent, convenient, simple, and, most importantly, different. Regardless of the environment or situation, PURRAIR will get the job done and outperform competitors.",
      "Periodic Spraying - the spray-type air fresheners we are so familiar with, for example, Febreeze, do not have a long-lasting effect.  The effects dissipate a few minutes after spraying, and foul odors return. PURRAIR is different from those temporary relief sprays. PURRAIR will refresh the air by eliminating harmful substances floating in the air.",
      "One of the most impressive features of PURRAIR is that it barely makes any noise. While it has an impeccable performance, the fan embedded in the device allows for a soundless performance. Individuals or pets sensitive to noise will feel at ease while PURRAIR is doing its job.",
      "PURRAIR does not require any replacement. Therefore there's no additional or hidden cost. PURRAIR's plasma unit is permanent, so you won't need any replacement filters. Improve your air quality and let your savings grow.",
      "PURRAIR's compact size and flat design make it portable. You can drop it into your backpack and take it anywhere with you. Bring the heavy performance with you while keeping your backpack light. Make your work desk an air-fresh zone or board a flight with peace of mind.",
      "Conventional air purifiers cannot reach hidden corners like shoe cupboards and pantries. PURRAIR's magnetic installation and high-capacity internal battery make it ideal for taking control of these difficult-to-reach spaces. Let PURRAIR work behind doors and improve the air quality everywhere.",
      "PURRAIR's minimal and straightforward aesthetics are designed to fit all interior spaces, from mid-century to victorian style. We have prepared six beautiful colors so that you can choose the right fit for your home and office.",
      "The hidden LED indicator shows the battery status. You can use it with the USB adapter connected or disconnected. The internal high-capacity battery will provide up to 20 hours of disconnected use. It only takes two and a half hours to charge fully.",
      "Simply touch and enjoy clean air. If odors are severe, then touch one more time for the boost mode. The fan will increase its speed up to 8,500 rpm and complete the difficult task of severe odor removal.",
      "No need to replace anything and no need to wash anything. You just need to swab the plasma pins every three weeks, which only takes 30 seconds. A cotton swab and 30 seconds every three weeks are all you need for maintenance.",
      "Chemical residue can be harmful to self-grooming pets and curious children. Unlike spray-type odor removers, PURRAIR leaves no residue while cleansing the air. The Ozone occurrence rate is only 0.008 ppm, significantly lower than the FDA's requirement of \"No more than 0.05\".",
      "Due to COVID-19, problems such as shipping and logistics worldwide continue to grow. Due to the shipping crisis, customers' parcels are often lost or delayed, and some of them are not being tracked. PURRIT has negotiated with several carriers to resolve this issue. Finally, we have decided to ship all packages via air transport. To all customers who purchase PURRAIR on Indiegogo, we ship the product by air courier to all world regions. This shipping method is one of the fastest. It takes 2-5 days for these flights to arrive at the customer's destination.",
      "It also provides accurate tracking information until the customer receives the product. Customers will be able to receive the product within a week after the PURRAIR production is completed.",
      "All staff will do their best to deliver and advance the announced production schedule.  PURRIT comprises engineers with extensive experience in development, design, software, production, and delivery.",
      "Risks and challenges",
      "We faced many risks and challenges when we first started conceptualizing the idea and developing the product. One of the most significant risks and challenges we faced was ensuring that the product was safe and free of harmful substances. The central concept is purifying and cleansing the air in the atmosphere. Still, that idea would be useless if it releases any kind of harmful chemical or substances in the air. Through countless testings and studies, we made sure PURRAIR is not harmful in any kind of circumstances. Another challenge we faced was making our product different from other existing air fresheners and purifiers. There are already many air purification and smell removing products out in the market. We needed to make our product different and stand out. We successfully made a compact and convenient purifier that is cost-efficient and semi-permanent. It stands out among other similar products with its strong and unique points. We are prepared to face any other challenges or obstacles that may face us. We promise to work our hardest to bring everyone the exemplary service and satisfaction they deserve.",

      "The helmet-mounted LED safety light designed to keep you visible and safe on the road",
      "Bringing Firefly to life has been a journey filled with innovation, iteration, and real-world problem-solving. From early prototypes to near-final production-ready models, our team tackled major engineering challenges to ensure a reliable, lightweight, and scalable product.",
      "In the early stages, we used AWG28 wires to connect the electronic components inside Firefly. This required manual soldering, which introduced a significant failure rate \u2014 nearly 50% of the prototypes showed glitches or poor connections. The wires would often come loose, and the folding mechanism added mechanical stress that made the system unreliable.\nTo solve this, we redesigned the internal structure to eliminate vulnerable wiring connections while preserving a stable and compact energy system.",
      "Firefly was designed with a folding feature to allow for compact packaging. Initial prototypes used miniature hinges with screws and nuts, which caused several assembly issues: poor screwing, broken plastic parts, and frequent nut loss. This approach was not scalable for mass production.\nWe overcame this by designing a custom plastic-injected hinge, completely removing the need for screws and dramatically improving the product's manufacturability and reliability.",
      "As we transitioned from prototype to production-ready, one of the toughest challenges we faced was scalability. What worked well in a handmade, one-off prototype didn\u2019t always translate smoothly to an efficient, repeatable process on a larger scale. Small imperfections, like minor asymmetries in 3D-printed parts or subtle misalignments during manual assembly, revealed just how sensitive the design was to production variables.",
      "To prepare Firefly for mass manufacturing, we had to redesign several internal components, simplify the assembly flow, and reduce the number of manual steps. We also invested in custom tooling and collaborated closely with manufacturers to ensure that tolerances, materials, and assembly logistics were feasible at volume \u2014 all without compromising the original concept or user experience.",
      "In short, making a product that works once is hard. Making one that works thousands of times, reliably and affordably, is a whole different challenge \u2014 but one we\u2019re proud to have tackled head-on.",
      "Firefly integrates a wide range of technical disciplines, each of which required dedicated development cycles. After five full iterations, we achieved the current design \u2014 a balanced blend of functionality, safety, and manufacturability.",
      "Our goal was to design an intuitive signaling system that required no external remote \u2014 just the user's natural head movement. This had to be simple enough for a child to understand and use, yet advanced enough to be trusted by any commuter.\nKey electronic components include:",

      "The housing geometry was refined to accommodate helmet curvature, maintain user comfort, and enclose all electronics in a protected, hollow internal structure. Every curve, thickness, and junction was considered to balance strength and usability.",
      "Though Firefly is mounted at the back of a helmet, it plays a crucial aerodynamic role. The device wraps partially around the helmet to enable 180\u00ba visibility, so its shape had to be engineered to minimize drag and avoid disrupting balance.\nAdditionally, the surface geometry was developed to prevent water accumulation, which could otherwise compromise electronic performance.\nAs a final design decision, we chose to split the side \u201cwings\u201d of Firefly for manufacturing and assembly efficiency. This decision, however, brought renewed attention to water-repellency \u2014 addressed through the selection of specialized plastics in those exposed areas.",
      "After extensive prototyping, testing, and refinement, Firefly is ready \u2014 but to move from a working prototype to full-scale production, we need your help. Your support will allow us to kickstart manufacturing, invest in production tooling, secure high-quality materials, and meet minimum order quantities. By backing this campaign, you\u2019re not just pre-ordering a product \u2014 you\u2019re helping us bring Firefly to life and make urban mobility safer for everyone.",

Our mission is to democratize access to expert-level legal analysis for everyone, from individuals to global enterprises, by eliminating inefficiencies and reducing costs through cutting-edge machine learning and natural language processing. We are seeking $2 million in seed funding to further develop our product, expand our market reach, and strengthen our team.",
      "What We Need & What You Get",
      "We are raising a $2 million seed round to fund the strategic development and deployment of Legal Chain. Here's how the funds will be allocated:",

Currently, 75% of U.S. attorneys spend 20+ hours per week on client tasks, and law firms lose over $9,000 per lawyer annually due to document inefficiencies. On average, lawyers bill only 2.9 hours (37%) of an 8-hour day, indicating struggles with inefficiencies. Legal Chain automates and optimizes legal workflows, including manual contract review, inefficient document search, compliance risk oversight, version control, and low-value administrative tasks. This results in reduced costs, increased accuracy, and unlocked billable hours for legal professionals.",

We offer a scalable solution for individuals, law firms of all sizes, corporate legal departments, and even government sectors. Our goal is to become the global standard for AI-driven legal intelligence, with an expected 5X revenue growth within 3-5 years.",

      "Strategically placed EMS pads boost the intensity of lower body training & help relax muscle fibers.",
      "Cellings is pair of leggings that assists with muscle toning thanks to the effects of Electro Muscle Stimulation (EMS) technology and special fabric. Cellings is designed to conduct frequency and waveform that is safe and capable to stimulate muscle. By shrinking and loosening muscle through direct stimulation, our EMS leggings can produce up to 4-10x better results.",
      "You can choose where you want more stimulation among 4 body parts \u2013 abdominal part, hip, front / back thigh \u2013 for EMS care. EMS stimulates muscle and supports your muscle relaxation before, while, and even after exercise.",
      "You can re-use it after sprinkling water, which is economical.",
      "A pad, which is produced with specially processed conductive fabric, and flexible code helps EMS pad be unnoticed. The pad is made using pressed and sewed thin sponge pad and conductive silver fabric and flexible conductive code, which makes it not show on the outside.",
      "There are 4 different modes - abdominal part \u2013 hip mode, front \u2013 back thigh mode, overall stimulus mode, and interval mode \u2013 that can be activated to stimulate specific muscle groups.",
      "Low frequency gets conducted even better if you add a spray or two of water to the special fabric inside Cellings.",
      "The EMS pads are made using pressed and sewed thin sponge-like materials and conductive silver fabric as well as flexible conductive code, which prevents the underlying material from protruding the surface.",
      "NILON + SPANDEX high-density double-sided fabric provides smooth touch, excellent durability, fast sweat absorption, and quick-drying effects like cotton.",
      "The inner fabric is flexible due to the (INNER) SHELRON + SPANNEDX high-density double-sided fabric and uses additional soft lightweight premium breathable fabric to absorb and dry sweat quickly.",
      "A special incision pattern on the exterior and interior Y-zone.",
      "Cellings is made of a blend of high-density double-sided SPANDEX, of which the thread is treated with a coating to have high specific heat capacity and help expel excess body heat during intense work out sessions.",
      "Q. Is it possible to exercise during pregnancy and menstruation?",
      "A. In general, you should not experience any issues when wearing Cellings during your menstrual cycle. However, please note that it may feel tight around the abdomen muscles which may be uncomfortable especially during workouts for sensitive individuals. Pregnant women could contract their uterus and strain it. We recommend going back to Cellings after 1 month for a natural delivery, and 3 months after a caesarean section. If you want to exercise, turn off the stimulation in that area and choose to apply it to other areas.",
      "Q. How many times do I have to do it to see the effect?",
      "A. It depends on age, gender, physical condition, living environment, and fitness, but you may have the effect of working out for two to three days with single 20-minute workout with Cellings. We have discovered that individuals who wear Cellings and exercise for more than 30 times of workout notice more drastic changes to the body compared to when they do not wear Cellings when working out.",
      "Q. Will the stimulation strain my body?",
      "A. EMS technology was invented for rehabilitation and treatment purposes. Our body is able to move thanks to the biomechanical signals we get from the brain. EMS biomechanical technology uses that same signal in order to deliver the stimulation deep into your muscle layer, and it is medically proven to be safe. The pain or muscle strain you could experience could be caused due to muscular development. EMS technology is widely being used in hospitals for medical purposes.",
      "Q. Is it not dangerous?",
      "A. It uses the same level of frequency that is used in hospitals and physical therapy clinics, so there is no danger.",
      "Q. Can you witness the effect without exercise?",
      "A. Yes, you can. However, our tests have shown that the results are best when you wear Cellings and exercise frequently throughout the week.",
      "Q. How much use do you recommend for a day?",
      "A. We recommend no more than having the EMS on more than 3 times a day for 20-minute intervals.",
      "Q. What strength level do you recommend?",
      "A. We recommend starting off at levels 1-5 when you are first using it. You can increase the intensity as you get used to the lower levels.",
      "Tobortec is working hard to develop original new technologies by operating alongside a research institute affiliated with our company which houses all of the technical skills needed to develop hardware.",

Over 9 months I traveled more than 13,000 miles across a majority of what you could describe as noman\u2019s land such as large plateaus, snow land, deserts & wilderness. It was really an amazing journey, but since most of the areas I passed were no-man's land, so most of the time I had no means to charge my phone, I couldn't film all those memorable scenes. And sometime there's no more power for navigation, I couldn't even call for help in an emergency. In the meantime, I have to carry a lot of supplies and equipments, makes the journey more difficult.",

However, we were able to make necessary changes and worked diligently to get back to schedule quickly. In the end, we actually started shipping early for many backers. For our second campaign, we completed and shipped everything on time without any delay. Any issues or concerns from backers were addressed within 24hr. The trust of our great community is reflected in the many positive reviews we've received on previous products and campaigns.",

VogDUO brings more to the overall design which not only makes it secured enough but light weight enough for everyday carry. It makes the AirPods Pro feel barely-there around you. Taking out the Airpods Pro from the case is also super convenient, all you have to do is just push from the bottom of the leather case.

Another historical milestone, the design of the Lunar Lander, which was used by NASA for the Apollo moon landing mission, is another source of inspiration for me. The Lunar Lander was designed to be lightweight, compact, and highly functional, with the ability to fold up and fit into a small space.

      "Follow this easy, step-by-step guide on our website. Screw driver recommended.",
      "How does Ario work?",
      "By adjusting its color and light direction, Ario mimics the natural light dark cycle our bodies evolved to expect. Your eyes contain non-visual photo receptors sensitive to blue light from above that help cue your body\u2019s natural circadian rhythm. By day, Ario delivers blue rich light from top and bottom to synchronize circadian rhythm, and help make your mind and body alert. At night, Ario delivers warm light with virtually no blue, in a downward direction. This allows you to see well without disturbing your body\u2019s natural production of melatonin.",
      "What is unique about Ario?",
      "Ario is the only lamp that fully supports circadian rhythm. With a unique combination of features, Ario automatically changes direction of light delivery and color over a wide range of controlled blue output. It includes a real-time clock and stored program to always light with the right color and direction of light. Ario is also brighter than consumer smart bulbs.",
      "What contributes to the cost of the lamp?",
      "The lamp includes the full fixture, two light sources, processor, real-time clock, and web app which allows you to customize your schedule. Considering it would take two bulbs, we compare favorably to smart bulbs that are 1/3 the brightness and cost $70-100/each. The lamp is also well made to last as long as the light sources.",
      "What about data?",
      "At Ario, we believe the data Ario learns about you are yours! You can safely and securely access your data via your personal account to see how you are living and make daily adjustments to live healthier.",

Our farm is more than a place to grow produce \u2014 it's a living, breathing example of how sustainable agriculture can strengthen communities, provide fresh food, and protect the environment for future generations.",
      "Over the years we have operated our farm but was hit consecutively by hurricanes such as Michael, Irma (back to back in two years), Ian and Nicole (back to back in the same year). Ian was particularly very destructive and not only did we lose buildings, greenhouse, fences, over 100,000 bees, animals and more but we were cut off from our farm for several days due to floods and high water levels with the overflowing of the St. Johns River. Our access road was literally cut in two as a river demarcated both sides of the roadway. Nicole came literally two months after and created more damage.",
      "We approached all of the government agencies including the local county, Federal Agencies, the Farm Services Agency (FSA) whom we have a long standing relationship with for assistance to rebuild our farm and introduce measures such as drainage and conversation with the intention of reducing the vulnerability of the farm to natural disasters. We got zero (0) assistance from any of these bodies all of whom promised to provide support. On every occasion of a disaster we took our resources and rebuilt our farm and improved our operations on our own. This campaign will greatly assist us in developing our new much more improved farm to provide critical support to the people of Florida and the USA to have a sustainable means of agriculture with good healthy and locally grown produce. In an environment of much uncertainty and increasing prices through tariffs, we need to ensure that create sustainable ventures with local foundation for our food security.",

      "On most cars the OBDII port is under the steering wheel:",
      "Once connected, the Brain will be able to read car information like mileage, speed, rpm, fuel level, battery charge, fault codes, fluid temperatures, sensor readings and it can also pinpoint your car location via GPS.",
      "That's great but how can one see this information on a phone?",
      "Well, while most OBDII devices only have Bluetooth, Cargenta Brain comes with Bluetooth and...an integrated Internet Connection. This makes it possible to see all your car information on your smartphone, from anywhere. And before you ask...yes, we will give you Internet data included with every Brain device. Yay!",
      "Cargenta Brain needs Internet connection to be able to send information to your phone. If for some reason, the carrier network is not available or the signal is too weak, e.g. distant rural areas, underground parkings or tunnels, Cargenta Brain will instead save the car data on its internal flash memory (128MB). Once the cellular connection is reestablished, Cargenta Brain will automatically reconnect and will send the missing records.",

As additional layer of security, users can setup a MAC list with authorized devices. If the unique MAC address of the device trying to connect to the Brain is not on that list, the connection will be automatically rejected.",
      "All BLE connections are encrypted using the Advanced Encryption Standard AES-128. This is one of the most sophisticated and widely adopted symmetric encryptions today. It is even being used by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) for encrypting top secret information.",
      "The only way to decipher the data is to have the AES Key used to encrypt it. So it is very secure.",
      "The connection between Cargenta Brain and our servers is done exclusively via TCP/IP using Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol as additional layer of security. TLS uses both symmetric encryption and public key encryption for securely sending private data, and also adds additional security features, such as authentication and message tampering detection.",
      "Cargenta Brain can be shipped worldwide*.",
      "When making a pledge for your Brain device, Indiegogo will automatically display the shipping cost, which varies per country.",
      "Shipping is done 10-12 days after your pledge is completed. The reason for this is that, Indiegogo gives the opportunity to all backers to cancel their donation within 10 days after its made. So we have to wait for 10 days before we ship your reward.",

      "Special Cases:",

      "*** An additional fee of $8/year WILL APPLY due to local carrier surcharges",
      "6. Why is that you don't offer Internet data in my country?",
      "In some countries the mobile carriers quote just too high price per MB. However, we are in active negotiations with alternative data providers and we might be able to include more countries on the go. Just keep checking on the supported country list.",
      "7. Can I still use Cargenta Brain if you don't offer Internet data in my country?",
      "Yes, you can. For that you will need to arrange a data plan with a carrier in your country and manually reconfigure Cargenta Brain via Bluetooth.",
      "However, you should keep in mind that we don't recommend using custom sim card if your country is on the supported list. Some functions which are manually initiated by the user like codes read/clear or device configuration changes will not be available remotely because the SMS gateway will be different.",
      "Location tracking, alerts, history, maintenance reminders, etc. will work fine.",
      "We aim to change this in the long run but for now the functionality with a custom sim card will be slightly limited. It is mostly intended for backers who really want to use Cargenta Brain but the Internet is not yet supported in their country.",
      "8. Can I use Cargenta Brain without ANY Internet Connectivity?",
      "Yes, absolutely. All Cargenta Brain devices feature a Bluetooth module so that you can locally connect to the Brain. All car data can be accessed via Bluetooth from the Cargenta mobile application.",
      "However, keep in mind that you will lose important features which require Internet connection to properly function like remote car connection, GPS tracking, live notifications, etc.",
      "Note: While all Cargenta Brain devices have Bluetooth enabled by default, iOS users will not be able to access this feature. The reason for this are Apple policies - they don't allow Bluetooth Classic connection, unless the manufacturer undergoes a special approval process. We will do that in the future but the Bluetooth feature is currently limited to Android users only.",
      "9. What means Unlimited Internet?",
      "Unlimited Internet refers to the Internet data service included with each Cargenta Brain Carbon Black edition. It is intended to be operational for a period of at least 5 years in combination with a Cargenta device and there are no restrictions for personal use as to the usage bandwidth or speed. We are not setting any duration limits either. The 5 years period refers to the period during which we estimate that the underlying technologies embedded in the Cargenta devices like cellular networks bands will remain operational. These are subject to third party policies and we cannot guarantee network carriers will support this technology 10 or 20 years from now, no matter how much as we would like to. It unlikely that it will be gone anytime soon but legally we cannot commit to provide a service for something that might not be there at some point. So based on a legal advice, the said period is 5 years and we will make a reasonable effort to offer the data service as long as technically possible.",
      "10. If I don't get the unlimited version, how much is the Internet going to cost afterwards?",
      "This is hard to estimate correctly at this point. Still to give you an idea, it will be probably in the range of $30-$35 per year. That is about $2.5-$3 per month.",
      "For comparison, some similar devices offer monthly subscription for $5 to $10 (or more) per month. For example, Hum in the US cost about $15/month. Cargenta Brain is 10x cheaper and has more features.",
      "11. Is my vehicle supported?",
      "Cargenta Brain is compatible with all cars produced after 1996.",
      "In particular, we support the following makes:\nAbarth, Acura, Alfa Romeo, Alpina, American Motors, Artega, Asia Motors, Aston Martin, Audi, Bentley, Bitter, BMW, Borgward, Brilliance, Bufori, Bugatti, Buick, Cadillac, Callaway, Caterham, Chevrolet, Chrysler, Citroen, Cupra, Dacia, Daewoo, Daihatsu, DFSK, Dodge, DS Automobiles, Ferrari, Fiat, Fisker, Ford, Gemballa, GMC, Hamann, Holden, Honda, Hummer, Hyundai, Infiniti, Isuzu, Iveco, Jaguar, Jeep, Kia, Koenigsegg, Lamborghini, Lancia, Land Rover, Lexus, Lincoln, Lotus, Mahindra, Maserati, Mastretta, Maybach, Mazda, McLaren, Mercedes-Benz, Mini, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Oldsmobile, Opel, Pagani, Panoz, Peugeot, Piaggio, Plymouth, Polestar, Pontiac, Porsche, Proton, RAM, Renault, Rolls-Royce, Rover, Saab, Saleen, Santana, Saturn, Scion, Seat, Skoda, Smart, Spyker, SsangYong, SSC, Subaru, Suzuki, Talbot, Tata, Tesla, Toyota, Volkswagen, Volvo and Westfield.",
      "If your car is not the list list or if you want to confirm whether your specific model is supported, please drop us a message on Kickstarter and we will check it for you!",
      "12. Can I get more than one device?",
      "Yes, absolutely!",
      "Just select a reward that you like and then on the next page (Configure reward) scroll down to the Add-ons section.",
      "There you will see a list with the following available options:",

      "If you need more, drop us an email and we will arrange it after the campaign is over.",
      "13. What are your Stretch Goals?",
      "We want our backers to determine what the Stretch Goals will be.\nThis is because we want to develop the features that YOU need and want to use.",
      "If you are interested in a particular Stretch Goal, drop us a message and let us know. We will develop the most desired features first.",
      "14. I have an idea about additional features. Can you develop them?",
      "Yes, absolutely! Our backers feedback is super important to us. We want to give you the features and functionalities that YOU WANT from the very beginning.",
      "Therefore, we plan to setup a \"Request a feature\" submission and voting process, where you can give ideas and suggestions about interesting features that you'd like to have. The most desired ones will be developed. For the time being, just send us an email at hello@cargeta.com.",
      "15. Can I join the Cargenta?",
      "Totally! Just drop us an email at hello@cargeta.com stating why you want to be part of the team. We will get back to you shortly thereafter.",
      "On the link below you can find the official press release, pictures, GIFs and videos for press and blog articles.",
      "Google Drive Link: Cargenta Press Kit",
      "Cargenta Brain features a high precision GPS module and built in antenna, which guarantee that GPS signal will be available under normal usage conditions and your vehicle can be easily located. It is important to note, however that the GPS signal most probably won't be available in underground parking lots and tunnels, where direct satellite visibility is not possible. Also, in the events of a \"cold start\" or \"offline start\" that is - the device has been unplugged for a long time or has lost GPS signal for a long period, it might need up to a minute (on rare occasions even more) to establish connection with the satellites once again. Therefore, in such situations you might expect a few location records to be missing.",
      "Cargenta Brain relies on cellular connection to transmit the data packets coming from your vehicle. Therefore, in areas where the mobile carriers signal is too weak or entirely absent, you might expect delay in getting the updates on your phone. Rest assured, you will not lose any trip details or car data - if the cellular network is not available, the Brain will store all information on its internal flash memory and will automatically send the data packets once there's better coverage.",
      "Cargenta Brain is capable of reading the vehicle data for most of the standard OBDII protocols. Those protocols have been established so that vehicle diagnostic data is available trough a standard OBDII port and car manufacturers are required to implement those protocols in all light serial production vehicles. That being said, a lot of OEMs choose to implement additional layer of proprietary protocols. Although, the Brain can read some of those proprietary protocols, we cannot guarantee that this is the case for all vehicle makes and models. This is particularly true for brand new models just coming out of the production lines. And while we want to give you the best experience when doing diagnostics on your car, we also want to be open about it and clearly state that the Brain will not feature the same capabilities as professional or OEM diagnostic tools right from day one. Nonetheless, we plan to improve and fill in all the gaps whenever we find them. We even plan to bring more functionality in the future like module encoding, remote control, and feature customization.",
      "Cargenta Brain needs Internet connection for all features to work properly. We thought it will be easier (and cheaper) for our users if we provide the Internet data along with the device, instead of each person contracting their own data plan. That being said, the Internet data is intended for personal use and is supposed to be used solely in conjunction with the hardware device. It cannot be used for any other purposes like setting up a hotspot or surfing the Internet. As of today we won't restrict the Indiegogo rewards being used by business users (like rent-a-car, taxi, corporate fleets, etc.) but we will expect fair use and won't be able to guarantee unlimited data if the vehicles are on the road 24/7. If you are interested in using Cargenta Brain as  business, get in touch with us and we will prepare a special offer for you.",

In addition, we worked hard with our suppliers to reduce, minimize and optimize the packaging materials without loosing the cool looks of the product. Distribution: Bulk shipment will be used wherever possible, mainly to reduce the shipping cost.

    "description": "Modern, intuitive + clean in 6-seconds. This cutting-edge design leaves other litter boxes in dust.",
    "company_name": "Boxscoop Designs Inc.",
    "allParagraphs": [
      "Modern, intuitive + clean in 6-seconds. This cutting-edge design leaves other litter boxes in dust.",
      "We are sold out on Indiegogo but Boxscoop 2.0 and Curve XL are available at theboxscoop.com",
      "The litter box is a real struggle, for all of us. This system will change that but before we explain the intricacies, we would like to tell you how it came to be. From a young age I have been passionate on design, efficiency and simplicity. When I grew up I became an Engineer. Michelle and I are both passionate on fairness and respect for all creatures. The disconnect between integrating the litter box into the household and having it ethical for our cats drove us crazy.",
      "From the start of 2017 through to Oct. 2018 we stood by helplessly watching my sister face an aggressive breast cancer; I coped by spending copious amounts of time fixated on designing a better litter box. We approached it from a completely different angle demanding the utmost efficiency with zero compromise. The vision was to create the perfect synergy between human AND cat needs.",
      "James + Michelle",
      "Boxscoop has modern aesthetics and because your eyes cannot catch the corners (there are none) it appears smaller than it is. It's an illusion... it's not meant for 25 lb cats but it is bigger than a standard litter box and far more ergonomic to the way cats move.",
      "Boxscoop is chore free to maintain, raises next to zero dust, and is designed from cat behavior studies for cat comfort... plus, it's modern and looks nothing like a litter box.",
      "We released our first model in July 2018 and the feedback was incredible. We recorded every detail and consistently analyzed for improvements. Success to us is making the most number of lives better. We brought the first model to market ourselves; we can do infinitely better together with you.",
      "When dealing with pee and poo, the fewer components and seams the better. The container, scoop and cover are all precision made. Ridges and contours are elegantly carved into the surface to allow it to slice through the litter like this. The design looks simple because we over-engineered for simplicity. Creating this sized container with precision in one piece requires a machine capable of pressing the equivalent weight of 330 cars!",
      "The cover on 2.0 is designed to securely fit without any clips, because who wants to fumble with clips every time they go to clean the litter box! It's actually so secure it's essentially dog proof!",
      "5 days and 2.7 minutes total spent on the litter box, including removing/replacing the cover and tossing the waste in another room\u2014 and that's daily cleaning with a 14-15lb cat. This is real life with Boxscoop.",
      "A standard clay litter in a standard litter box with one large cat costs ~US$ 220 per year. Boxscoop is extremely litter efficient and saves hundreds in litter costs:",
      "*Annual costs calculated are approximations based on one large cat (12-15lbs). For full experiment and results, please see our blog post: The cost of cat litter",
      "From surveys, 52% of our backers use clay litter and Boxscoop is ~35% more litter efficient than a standard litter box with clay litter. From the 6000 we've shipped in 2019, that translates to at least 500,000lbs less clay litter being consumed per year. That's a big deal, and with every new Boxscoop 2.0 shipped, the number will keep increasing.",
      "We engineered features into the design to perform even better with alternative clumping litters like corn, grass, walnut, wheat and more. These litters are lighter, healthier for cats, biodegradable and they stay fresher longer, saving you money while saving the environment and your cats health.",
      "This is Boxscoop with a Walnut based litter:",
      "Grass litter compliments almost all other clumping litters, especially clay. It's typically odor and dust free and it clumps and absorbs odors and moisture amazingly well.",
      "If you have a clay litter you love, mixing 30-50% of a grass litter in with the clay will keep the litter fresher and extend its life. It also lightens heavy clays and makes them even easier to scoop!",
      "*Dr. Elsey Ultra and other similar coarse grain clay litters are sludgy and require more scooping force in Boxscoop. If you'd like to use a coarse grain clay, we highly recommend mixing in 30-50% of a grass or walnut litter.",
      "This is Dr.Elsey's Ultra with 50% Grass litter added:",
      "Boxscoop components are 100% recyclable\u2014 and we package without the use of plastic.",
      "We're also currently developing a toss container that will seamless attach to Boxscoop so you can scoop, toss and compostable bag quickly! The toss container holds and dispenses rolls of compostable doggie waste bags.",
      "This accessory will be available for your Boxscoop in April 2020, and as a Boxscoop backer you can pre-order it directly from our site at 67% discount.",
      "Cats have 200 million odor-sensitive cells and it\u2019s our mission to make daily cleaning easy, so your cats have one of their most basic and overlooked needs fulfilled\u2014a clean comfortable place to do their business.",
      "Do you have 20-30 seconds a day? Thirty seconds is \u00bc the time it takes to brush your teeth and the scoop will run through all the litter getting those little nasties out; it's a rewarding feeling and your cats will thank you with extra purrs",
      "Boxscoop 2.0 is recommended for cats up to around 15lbs that are agile and can easily jump up on to a couch. The scoop can also be stored outside, or Boxscoop can be used with the cover off for cats that want a bit of extra room.",
      "Boxscoop Curve XL is available on our website for cats up to 20-21lbs. If you are interested in Curve XL click the link below:",
      "Boxscoop Curve XL",
      "Inside Boxscoop cats can freely turn and the open top gives them visibility to everything around them. They feel safe, secure and always have the option to pounce out if something makes them uneasy.",
      "*Photos from our original model. Boxscoop 2.0 is even more open on top.",
      "80% of cats take to Boxscoop like \"ducks to water\" the other 20% require more time. The design works both with and without the cover; this way the skeptic cats can adjust at their own pace.",
      "Purrwood forest uses them both ways throughout their no kill sanctuary.",
      "The beauty of having no corners or seams makes sanitizing the whole litter box so easy and rewarding.",
      "For an extra deep clean you can let the scoop and container sit in a vinegar/water solution.",
      "You can have your very own Boxscoop 2.0... you just have to help us create it for you!",
      "This was our timeline from 2019. We successfully produced 6000 Boxscoop 2.0s in 2019 and fulfilled Shipment #1 and #2 on time! We've now finished production for our March 2020!",
      "Boxscoop began with Arthur, a Bengal that started her life being mistaken for a boy. Arthur loved to dig, she was a cat after all!! but she hated being enclosed; Michelle disliked the dinosaur litter box in our closet and I felt the design efficiencies of litter boxes were absurd.",
      "On Feb. 21, 2017 I wrote this:",
      "In July 2018, we released the original Boxscoop. It received incredible feedback but it also could be far improved. It was our first attempt and we funded it ourselves. It was an exciting time we felt we were making a real difference! Then on October 6th, while running around chasing a feather Arthur collapsed. She was only 2.5 years old and completely had our hearts... She had a genetic heart condition called HCM and just like that little Arthur was gone... and then 15 hours later my sister took her last breaths as well.",
      "The easy thing to do would be quit Boxscoop... but this was inspired by Arthur, and encouraged by Kristy. They planted the seed and we are beyond inspired to take Boxscoop to the next level.",

Coffee Genie shows the storage period and how long you can preserve the coffee beans through a digital bar on the lid every time you open it. The storage period is maintained until reset.\n\n\nCoffee Genie has a large capacity (850ml) to store roasted beans.\nIt can preserve about 330g with beans and 350g with shredded beans.",

When we developed a storage capsule for tea for the first time, we also thought that such an idea may apply to coffee for serious coffee lovers. We have changed the design, size, and few features to suit to preserve coffee beans. We hope you enjoy your coffee in the best condition all time with our Coffee Genie.\n\nThank you.",

Kickstarter crowd, it\u2019s time to celebrate your love for food!",

      "We paid special attention to the pot\u2019s weight distribution. After a detailed study and extensive testing on the shape and the size of the handles, we created a well-balanced product, easy to move between burners. The handles are large, ergonomic, and so convenient to use.",
      "We also calibrated the thickness to guarantee the optimal heat distribution with the right weight, as well as being naturally non-stick.",

      "Now, you don\u2019t need 100 pots with their useless lids cluttering up your kitchen. You only need The Food Lover: one pot with a multitude of uses. It\u2019s an easy way to cook like a professional, at a price you can afford.",
      "But that's not all\u2026 together with you we\u2019d like to celebrate nature and help the planet too! In particular, that aspect that gives life to one of the healthiest foods: Extra Virgin Olive oil, pride and Italian heritage. For each order, we will plant in our farm a new 3 years old olive tree that will bear your own name and that you\u2019ll see in picture after the first year of growth!",
      "The Food Lover fits every cooking surface: gas, induction, glass-ceramic. It fits perfectly in the oven. Try it on the campfire too!",
      "Italy is like nowhere else in the world when it comes to food. In Italy, food is an art and a passion. Growing up in Italy, our grandmothers would cook us delicious meals which we have never forgotten. Those memories are fixed in our minds. However, there is always room for something new on which we can create more memories.",
      "Around two years ago, we identified something that was missing in the kitchen: the perfect pan. That\u2019s when we first had the idea for The Food Lover.",
      "The Food Lover looks simple and is intuitive to use as if it\u2019s been around forever. But, it took a lot of work to bring our idea to life.",
      "Our first task in creating The Food Lover was choosing materials. We wanted to find the perfect material for heat distribution and retention. It also had to be hard-wearing and look great. After looking at ceramic, aluminium, even stone, we settled on cast iron. There\u2019s a reason Italians have cooked with cast iron for hundreds of years!",
      "The next part of the process was developing the 4-in-1 pan system that we had in our minds. Our designers and engineers worked for 14 months creating the optimal system. We visited dozens of manufacturers to make sure their machine tools were equal to the job of creating our perfect pan.",
      "Finally, we tested our new creation with every type of food you can imagine, notably my family recipe lasagne Bolognese.",
      "We think we\u2019ve created something very special, and we back this up with a lifetime guarantee. Because we spent so long developing and testing The Food Lover, we can be 100% sure that it will become the first thing you reach for when you want to cook up some more magical memories.",
      "Whether it\u2019s an old family recipe passed down from your ancestors to something brand new to wow your dinner guests, The Food Lover will help you produce meals no one will ever forget.",
      "Your pan and grill lid are both in classic black Pure Iron color.",
      "For your main pot, select from RED and obviously PURE IRON. Your choice will be processed after the end of the campaign.",
      "The Food Lover are among the lightest cast iron pots on the market. They are perfectly weight balanced with a double handler for easy grip. The removable stay-cool silicone handle grips withstand temperatures up to 500 degrees F.",
      "Every piece of iron at our foundry is sampled and tested to meet the highest standards.  Food Lover pots and pans are made from 75-90% recycled iron. They\u2019re non-toxic, with no added paints or chemicals. Plus, we recycle all the sand from the casting so, no waste! We offer a lifetime guarantee on all our cookware.",
      "Timeline",
      "When it comes to food, Italy like nowhere else in the world. In Italy, food is art, passion. TheFoodLover is a team of Italian cooks and designers in search of the perfect taste. In the last few years, The Food Lover team has brought dozens of ideas to life, helping cooks just like you create better dishes and have more fun in the kitchen. Now, we\u2019ve created a revolutionary cookware system. We can\u2019t wait for you to enjoy it!",

    "title": "Njori Tempo - A smart cooker for adventurous chefs",
    "description": "Get complete control over your cooking. Measure, monitor and regulate temperature constantly.",
    "company_name": "Njori",
    "allParagraphs": [
      "Get complete control over your cooking. Measure, monitor and regulate temperature constantly.",
      "Njori was founded over a love of great food and great design. As product designers and keen cooks we faced a common problem when experimenting with new recipes and techniques - lack of accuracy, and too many single use kitchen gadgets taking up space in our kitchens.",
      "This dilemma got our design and development brains thinking: why isn\u2019t there a single product that offers complete control with endless possibilities to experiment, yet comes in a streamlined design that takes up a fraction of cupboard space?",
      "The idea of the Njori Tempo was born!",
      "Cooking by exact temperature is the next stage in cooking evolution.",
      "The sprung, direct contact temperature sensor continually monitors the pan temperature as you cook.  The Tempo then regulates the power to maintain your desired temperature. This ensures you get consistent results and helps you to refine your recipes.",
      "The Tempo is designed to compliment your everyday cooktop, rather than replace it, giving you additional precise temperature control over your cooking.",
      "Preset modes pair with temperature probes to perfect the most adventurous recipes possible.",
      "Sous-vide was once the preserve of professional kitchens, but thanks to the Tempo\u2019s ability to set and maintain specific temperatures using a feedback loop, it\u2019s easy to create melt-in-the-mouth Asian pork belly, Korean beef short ribs and tender teriyaki salmon at home.  The water circulator and probe simply combine to turn your pan into a water bath, perfect for gentle cooking.",
      "Deep frying also uses the probe accessory, attaching easily to the side of your pan. The probe automatically corrects the temperature as you place cold ingredients into the pan making it a breeze to rustle up crunchy fried chicken, light and crispy tempura prawns or delicious doughnuts with confidence.",
      "Nothing beats the flavour slow cooking imparts \u2013 but heavy slow cookers take up valuable cupboard space. You can serve succulent stews or casseroles using your pan of choice with the Njori Tempo in slow cook mode.",
      "You can even place the probe into a piece of meat and set the ideal temperature to ensure it's cooked to perfection!",
      "Integrated scales also allow you to weigh ingredients before and during cooking and equally portion up the final creation.",
      "The scales also allow you to use the reduce by weight function, ideal for bringing new consistency to sauces and reductions.",
      "Straight out of the box, the magnetic dial gives the user instant control over pan temperature, via the direct contact temperature sensor in the center of the glass. This means you're safe in the knowledge that whatever you put in the pan, the cooker has you covered.",
      "Our patent pending dial has been configured to give you effortless and instant control. With a built in button it makes selecting your mode of choice even easier.",
      "The Njori Tempo has an extremely sleek and compact design.  This makes the Tempo easy to store or transport. Accessories and cables tidy away neatly in the cork base, which is held closed by powerful magnets.",
      "This was a high priority when first designing the product. When in use it won\u2019t take up valuable space on your worktop and when not in use, it can be stored on a bookshelf alongside your favourite cookbooks.",
      "The Njori Tempo comes complete with all the accessories you need to cook like a pro.",
      "We have worked tirelessly for 3 years developing the Njori Tempo, using all our previous experience and design expertise.",
      "The mechanical design has been done in house and we've been working with experienced electronics engineers in developing both the power and control electronics in parallel.",
      "Early testing of the electronics control system",
      "In developing the temperature feedback (PID) loop, we also developed our own software called 'Njori Labs'. The video below shows how we used Njori labs to test and refine the different cooking methods before the full user interface and magnetic control dial were added.",
      "Every aspect of the user experience has been considered when designing the Tempo, from the design of the on screen interface, to the feel of the magnetic dial and buttons. We have tried to ensure the product is a joy to use from start to finish so you can discover your potential and fine tune the recipes you\u2019re most passionate about.",
      "At Njori, our mission is to help people take their cooking to the next level.",
      "Njori was founded by Design Engineers, Jack Raison and Nick Orme. We have worked together for several years in the tech development industry, designing and developing products for a variety of companies.  After discovering a shared love for cooking, we decided to use our expertise to develop and manufacture our own product.",
      "We wanted to say a special thank you to all our supporters, investors, friends and family who've helped us get to this stage. We couldn't have done it without you!",
      "We're excited to see the Njori community grow so please share with any fellow cooking enthusiasts and feel free to reach out if you have any questions!",
      "We have been working on the Tempo for around three years and during that time we've done everything we can to reduce risk by ensuring all elements are properly developed and tested. We also have a track record of developing products for manufacture for other companies and brands and so following best practice.",
      "Production",
      "We have a shortlist of our final suppliers lined up and have back up options for all individual components should we have any issue with delays of specific parts. We are waiting for Covid restrictions to lift to visit our suppliers in person before making the final decision.",
      "We have used our previous experiences to ensure DFM (design for manufacture) stages are complete and all parts and components have been considered for mass manufacture and assembly. We have also checked capacities and are confident all suppliers can cope with production at scale should we surpass our goals.",
      "We have confidence in our projected timelines but as with all hardware development projects, delays can happen due to unforseen circumstances so we have added buffer where possible.",
      "Supply Chain Risk",
      "We identified a shortage in microchips (an issue worldwide due to Covid) a few months ago and placed an order for more than one years worth of the chips we need. We are expecting the long lead times here to be reduced, as has been the case with other microchips but we are keeping in regular contact with our suppliers and will monitor the situation carefully. We have managed to procure a smaller supply of chips, meaning all regular testing and our pilot run up until final production will still be possible.",
      "We also have a wider procurement team and expert advisors on hand to discuss strategy should we have any unexpected shortages. If this happens, we'll be sure to keep you informed and work to quickly solve the problem.",
      "Quality Control and Testing",
      "We plan to do extensive testing with our beta units. This will involve initially using a 3rd party test house to ensure all electronics and mechanical components are pushed to their limits. Once certification is complete and the product has passed regulatory testing we will be offering our community the chance to become beta testers.",
      "If there are any changes to our projected timeline, we\u2019ll be sure to let you know as soon as we can.",
      "Environmental commitments",
      "Long-lasting design",
      "We will be doing accelerated lifecycle testing to ensure the product will be long lasting. We have also designed our product to have a built in USB stick and port for software updates and diagnostics. This means we can push out updates and upgrades to ensure our product software stands the test of time.",

      "The BoardSwag was dreamt up by a couple of road-tripping Aussie surfers who slept a night in their boardbags to catch the early session at a secluded break. While the surf was mind blowing, the wet, uncomfortable sleep sparked an idea. And the Boardswag was born.",
      "With its inbuilt swag and mattress, BoardSwag makes your surfing adventures more spontaneous!",
      "On the outside BoardSwag looks like your typical travel cover, on the inside it's so much more. Featuring a top compartment that comfortably holds 3 boards and any other gear you can throw at it, and an additional bottom compartment that unzips to reveal an inflatable swag for you to crawl into at night.",
      "The SwagTrek",
      "The SwagTrek is a camper friendly swag that comfortably fits in your carry bag or rucksack.",
      "It comes with a dry lock, waterproof carry bag so you can be sure you have a dry sleep.",
      "Dry lock waterproof bag to carry the tent.",
      "The BoardSwag tent component can be completely inflated and set up in under a minute, and the pack up is even quicker! We've made the process as simple as possible so you can spend more time in the surf and less time setting up camp.",

      "Keep your clothes clean and your food clean with water repellent and anti-bacterial technology.",
      "Aprons are supposed to keep you clean from messes in the kitchen... but too many aprons actually bleed through when wet, ruining the clothes underneath with stains.",
      "Infrequently washed aprons harbor sickness-causing bacteria and that can spread throughout the kitchen. This cross-contamination of bugs can lead to higher chances of foodborne illness.",
      "Above all, an apron should keep you clean and protect your clothes underneath. With a unique double-layer fabric, Spyce blocks any water from passing through. This prevents stains on the clothes that you care about.",
      "Spyce aprons kill 99% of bacteria, reducing the risk of foodborne illness from cross-contamination in the kitchen. With thousands of minerals embedded in every thread, this apron stays anti-bacterial even through repeated washes. Welcome to the new era of clean.",
      "Heavy aprons can strain your neck. With Spyce, every fiber is designed to mimic a feather's structure. Coming in a total of 5.7 oz, this apron is so light you\u2019ll forget it\u2019s there.",
      "Durable, aesthetic, and sleek. Cheap plastic doesn\u2019t belong anywhere in a kitchen where it is prone to melting and falling apart. That\u2019s why we replaced them with high-quality metal clasps and genuine leather. Adjusting your apron has never been easier.",
      "The textile industry heavily overuses harsh, corrosive chemicals like dyes and bleaches. We believe this doesn't belong anywhere near your food. That\u2019s why Spyce aprons use medical-grade fabric that is hypoallergenic.",
      "A standard apron should be washed after every use to prevent the growth of bacteria. With anti-bacterial technology, Spyce can be washed much less frequently meaning it's better for the environment and saves you money too!",
      "We use the same silky smooth fabric on our straps as the rest of the apron and craft it with a thicker more comfortable design. There\u2019s no cotton webbing or digging into your neck.",
      "We focused on detailed craftsmanship in designing these aprons. To provide the highest quality product, we manufacture these aprons in Los Angeles to ensure careful oversight of the process.",
      "We use a molecular-level infusion process to embed and crystalize natural minerals directly into every thread. This more involved technology permanently locks them within the fibers, enhancing the fabric with anti-bacterial characteristics, even after repeated washes. These minerals (including titanium, zinc, and zirconium) kill 99% of bacteria.",
      "Underneath this mineral-infused polyester is a water-repellent membrane which has nano-sized pores that are too small for water to pass through but large enough to remain breathable. This double-layer system blocks any water from passing through, protecting your clothes from any spills or stains.",
      "We've made it our mission to help you live healthier through innovatively designed products. After testing dozens of fabrics and sourcing materials that uphold our mission, we\u2019ve combined detailed craftsmanship with cutting edge technology to create a one of a kind apron. Staying clean has never been this easy.",
      "At the age of 10, I was diagnosed with Leukemia and spent my childhood constantly aware of how dangerous exposure to bacteria could be. Having survived, I set out to find solutions to minimize our exposure to harmful bacteria so we can live healthier and cleaner lives.",
      "Many charitable organizations helped me survive this challenging experience and I was inspired to give back in meaningful ways. With OURA, our mission is to improve lives with products that heal and inspire others to give back.",
      "- Keane, OURA co-founder",
      "We are a team of scientists, designers, and operational experts. We deeply understand what is required to craft and manufacture this product, having successfully done so in the past.",
      "Our US-based factories are ready to begin production immediately and are capable of handling massive order quantities. We have already produced a sample run, working out all kinks that may occur during manufacture.",
      "We anticipate being able to fulfill orders within 10-12 weeks, but predicting delivery times can be inexact. Should our volumes surpass our expectations, it may take slightly longer to fulfill orders but we have full confidence in being able to ship our products by September 2019.",
      "If you love what we are doing but aren't able to reserve an apron for yourself, we would love to get some love. Share our story on Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, WhatsApp, Weibo, or with Karen in the break room. We would love anything you do to spread our mission!",

      "1. How many LEDs does CarWink have and how many colors can it show?",
      "This device has 469 RGB LEDs and 11 white LEDs. They consist of RGB LEDs controller by a 12-bit LED driver. In other words, each of the red/green/blue channel has 2^12 = 4,096 steps. In total, that is 2^36 = 68,719,476,736 combinations. Human vision may not be able to discern so many colors though. However, the mixture of colorful lights, unlike the mixture of paints, may not be able to show colors such as gray or brown.",
      "2.What is your refund policy?",
      "Due to the nature of Kickstarter, we cannot offer refunds to backers once the project ends, with the exception of the unlikely instance of a defective reward being shipped out. Once the campaign ends, your pledges are put to use immediately to ensure that CarWink enters into production as soon as possible. Therefore, we cannot offer refunds once the campaign has ended.",
      "3. I live outside the United States. Will I have to pay duties/VAT to receive my reward?",
      "This depends on your local tax code. Any applicable duties/VAT are the sole responsibility of the backer, and not our team. We have absolutely no control over charging each backer additional duties/VAT at the time the pledge is made, and so these fees (if applicable) may be imposed at the time of receiving the package. If you are unsure whether or not you will be charged duties/ VAT at the time of receiving your reward, please get in touch with your local post office.",
      "4. Are the pictures on this page the final version of CarWink?",
      "No, but they're pretty close! The CarWink you're seeing in our video and images on this page are the initial prototypes of our design. The final version of CarWink will be very close to this, though small changes in materials, functionality, and design may take place as we hear more feedback from the community!",
      "5. How many languages does the CarWInk voice control function support?",
      "Currently, CarWink supports English as the primary language. However, CarWink does support diversified languages that \u201cOK Google\u201d and \u201cSiri\u201d support. The \u201cOK Google\u201d and \u201cSiri\u201d api will be utilized to execute the voice recognition through cloud computing technology. In the future as we expand our product to other countries, there will also be additional language support added.",
      "6. How will my private information be protected?",
      "You are in control of what function you want to show through the CarWink app, and from the CarWink app to the service server. Therefore, CarWInk will not be constantly monitoring and gathering your information. CarWink only processes what it needs to improve the",
      "algorithms for keeping everyone\u2019s uniqueness and providing highly personalized services.",
      "7. CarWink is so unique! Have you got a patent on it yet?",
      "Great question. Yep! CarWink is utility and design patent pending.",

      "The most compact worldwide 100W GaNFast charger with PFC, 4 ports, and converting cables",
      "SlimQ F100 is the by the far the world's smallest 100W GaN charger with a complete PFC function for true global use. Using next-generation GaNFast (gallium nitride) technology for small size and high power, it can charge up to 4 devices at the same time \u2013 from earbuds to phones, to tablets and the MacBook 16\u201d. It is nicely designed and supports most of the fast-charging protocols for modern phones and laptops.",
      "With a dimension of 70 x 68 x 29mm, the SlimQ F100 is smaller than two packs of Doublemint. It is by far the world's smallest 100W charger that has a complete PFC circuit (more about PFC later).",
      "Compared to a series of Apple's chargers, the F100 stands out with more power and more fast-charging ports.",
      "SlimQ F100 is easy to handle and carry around, thanks to its small size and carefully applied exterior material.",
      "If your laptop does not have a USB Type-C power port, don\u2019t worry! We have prepared more than 20 types of converting cables that work with virtually all laptops on the market, including Macbook Pro, Microsoft Surface, Lenovo, Dell, HP, Acer, ASUS, etc. (A list of the cables is in \"specification\" section)",
      "SlimQ F100 works well with Macbook Pro, including the Macbook Pro 15\" and 16\" that consumes max power of 87W and 96W, respectively.",
      "A new power semiconductor material - gallium nitride (GaN) - runs up to 20x faster than old, slow silicon (Si) chips, delivering up to 3x more power conversion and half the size and weight. GaNFast power ICs from Navitas Semiconductor enables the SlimQ F100 fast charger to reach world-class 94% efficiency, which means a cool operation in a small size. For more information on GaN, see www.GaNFast.com.",
      "SlimQ F100 includes a Power factor correction (PFC) circuit. The purpose of PFC is to improve the power factor which means power quality. Although the PFC circuit increases the charger size significantly, it increases energy efficiency, reduces electricity costs, and reduces the load on the electricity system. For adapters that have higher than 75W capacity, the PFC function is necessarily required by government regulations all over the world. With the PFC circuit, SlimQ F100 has a PF value of >0.95 compare to ~0.45 for chargers without PFC.",
      "The presence of PFC also makes our charger more environment friendly compared to one without it. Assume the charger is used 10 hours a day and 300 days a year, compared to one without PFC, our charger can save 230KWHr electricity, which is equivalent to 227 pounds of carbon emission. It takes ten trees to offset that amount of carbon emission.",
      "We believe design is essential and even the center of a product. We designed the SlimQ F100 with multiple use case scenarios in mind. We paid attention to subtle details that might affect the user experience. The following shows the original design sketches that have evolved into an actual product. Along the way, we have made improvements and compromises.",
      "With the design of foldable prongs and clip-on international converters, the SlimQ F100 is quite flexible to be used virtually anywhere in the world. Please note: we will give ONE free converter according to the country of shipping destination. For example, if ship to the UK, the F100 will have a UK converter with it. If ship to South Korea or Germany, it will come with a DE/KR converter. If you need all four converters, please choose them from the add-ons and add them to your order.",
      "There are situations where you will need an extension cable to reach a power outlet. For such cases, the specially designed extension cords will become handy. The cable has the clip-on plug to the F100 to make it look neat and maintain a small footprint.",
      "To show a little gratitude to our backers, we offer this Magnetic tip Type C to Type C cable at a significant discount. This cable is 5A/100W rated and is suitable for USB 2.0 data transmission. It comes in 5 colors and makes an excellent companion to the SlimQ F100 charger. Please note: it is only available as an add-on when you buy a perk.",

      "We will continue to receive ideas for stretch goals. The first stretch goal we picked is a USB Type-A to Type-C converter. The converter has a small footprint so you can literally leave it on the charger. It supports QC3.0 for fast charging and USB2.0 for data transmission. While we will all be using Type C in the future, we are still in a world of a mix of Type A and Type C. This little converter helps us to manage the transition into the future.",
      "We will include ONE converter for each F100 Charger that you receive when we reach the stretch goal!",
      "SlimQ 65W comes with a FREE anti-tangle Silicone Type-C to Type-C cable and a FREE carry case.",
      "The most challenging work for this product is to fit all the components into a small case and have it working at >100W. The following video shows the out of box board working at >100W consistently. The left screen shows a PF value of 0.99, which is almost perfect. The right screen shows it works at ~108W.",
      "My shipping address is not in the US/Japan/China. What converter do I get? Do I get all the converters?",
      "To avoid causing plastic waste, we do NOT send all four converters for each charger you buy. There are no converters for users in US/Japan/China etc. Otherwise, for each charger you order, we give one FREE converter according to the country of your shipping address. For example, for UK/Singapore/HongKong, we have a UK converter with it. For Korea/Germany, we have the KR/GE converter with it. If you are in EU countries, we will have the EU converter with it. If, for some reason, you do need a different converter, please order the converter package that has all four converters we have. The package is in the list of add-ons and costs $3.",
      "I have an old laptop that does not use Type C, how do I find the right cable for it?",
      "If your laptop is Lenovo, Apple, Surface, etc., it's easy to tell by its tip head. The difficulty may come in if your laptop is using a round plug tip. The reliable way to find the right cable is to find the dimension of the tip and find a matching one on our list. Make sure you find the matching one for a particular brand as some laptop models share the same tip dimension even they are from different brands. To find the dimension, as shown in the following pictures, you can either use a ruler to measure the current cable tip or research it online by using data on your current power adapter (normally on the back of the power adapter). If there is any doubt, please contact info@slimq.life with your computer model and a picture of the spec on your current adapter, so we can help you to find the right cable.",
      "How can I buy multiple cables of the same type?",
      "It is not easy to buy an add-on item multiple times on Indiegogo. Please contact us at info@slimq.life and let us know what the items and how many are. We need to make arrangements for that.",
      "I use the F100 charger for multiple devices, how is the power distributed among the ports?",
      "Please check the section \"Intelligent Power Distribution.\" where you can find a table of all combinations of use cases. Please feel free to contact us if you have any suggestions or feedback on this.",
      "I just bought an F100 yesterday, how to add a cable to my order?",
      "If your order is not in \"locked\" or \"fulfillment\" status, it means your order is still not processed. The easiest is to cancel the older order and make a new one and add the cable in the add-on section to your new order before making payment. If your order is already processed, there is no way to change it, please contact us at info@slimq.life, and we will help you with that.",
      "When will you ship the products?",
      "We plan to start shipping orders within July. For other shipping related questions, please refer to the \"Shipping Policy\" section down below.",
      "Do you have any referral program?",
      "Yes, absolutely. We offer 10% cash reward for any referral purchases. Please use this link to sign up. Then you will have your unique referral link. Just send your referral link to friends or colleagues, when they make a contribution to our project by using your link, you get a 10% reward. It is that simple!",
      "Although quite rare, international shipping may be subject to import taxes, customs duties, and fees levied by the destination country. YOU WILL BE RESPONSIBLE for those charges and procedures to clear custom for the shipped item. Again, it is your full responsibility to clear it by working with the shipping company or custom directly.",
      "It is also the recipient's responsibility for charges such as change of address, parcel holding, return fees caused by the recipient. So please make sure you have the correct address information, including a phone number on file.",
      "1) To which countries do you ship?",
      "We ship globally, excluding those have been flagged by courier services as restricted or high risk: Belarus, Cote d'Ivoire, Cuba, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Liberia, North Korea, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Syria & Zimbabwe. If you would like a shipment to any of these countries, we will make alternative arrangements that may cost more. However, we cannot guarantee the shipment's arrival.",
      "2) Do I have to pay European VAT / GST?",
      "Yes, and the amount will depend on your country\u2019s regulations. However, usually the price is not that high, and people just get it directly.",
      "3) What if my packet gets lost?",
      "If the packet is not marked as \"delivered.\", we can help to locate it and resend it when it gets lost. If the packet is marked as \"delivered\" in the mail system and you don't get it, it is your responsibility to contact the local post office or express company to get it resolved.

Equipped with soft wheels, it effortlessly delivers smooth and repeatable signature dolly movement on any flat surface, which otherwise would require bulky equipment and a large team.

Hyperdolly allows you to make precise motion time after time, enabling you to focus on the actual shot, rather than trying to eliminate camera wabbling.",

With the funds raised on Kickstarter, we will be able to carry out necessary simulations, run tests, and set up the manufacturing process for such wheels. We have already found contractors to help us with this task. The tires will look similar to the concept:",

We've paid close attention to this critical aspect and our dolly will perform well in studio environments or other locations with even floors. In fact, many studio dollies can be used indoors without tracks.",

I realized its vast potential, and from then on I switched my focus from being a filmmaker to working on a startup. I was fortunate to meet talented people along the way who helped me build a fantastic Hyperdolly prototype showcased on this page.

We'll do everything we can to complete the project on time, but there are always factors that are out of our control. Hyperdolly is assembled in Ukraine. Despite the ongoing war in the country's east, businesses in the rest of Ukraine operate as usual. Our manufacturing is located in the center, specifically in Kyiv, over 550 km (350 miles) from the frontline, so it is safe. Hyperdolly was developed entirely during wartime. No matter what, we will always be transparent about any issues we discover. If something goes wrong, we will sacrifice margin to meet our obligations.

      "Pack lite and go anywhere, anytime!",
      "Let\u2019s face it: packing your toiletries is not the smoothest thing on earth. Traveling with separate containers consumes valuable space and the containers often leak. No matter how organized you try to be, keeping track of too many containers can be difficult. Thus, GoBout was invented with two goals: Simplicity and environmental friendly.",
      "Before GoBout, we have been carrying separate travel size bottles, usually inside a plastic bag, for lack of a more suitable, smart and sustainable alternative. Millions of people use plastic containers and plastic bags to transport toiletries every day. Tens of billions of plastic toiletry containers end up in waste landfills every year. This needs to change if we are to save our planet from pollution. GoBout helps solve this crisis by offering a convenient, comprehensive way of reusing travel size bottles. You simply refill your capsules at home and store them in our beautiful housing dispenser.",
      "GoBout comes in two sizes: Large and small.",
      "For the large version, there are five capsules. Each capsule is less than 100ml or 3.4 ounces, which means at some airport security checks, you just have to remove the capsules from the main body.",
      "For the small version, there are four capsules. In total, the small version carries less than 100 ml or 3.4 ounces. You don't need to remove capsules from the main body because it complies with air travel rules.",
      "The biggest challenge in designing GoBout was achieving simplicity. How should the user select different products to dispense? How do we avoid accidental leaks? How to refill empty canisters in the most efficient and environmentally friendly way possible? We researched every conceivable dispensation method: Aerosal, compressed air, vacuum, etc.",
      "In the end, we achieved all of our goals without sacrificing function or form. The final GoBout design is a simple, elegant solution to a real problem.",
      "A simple design means less complexity, better user experience, and less opportunity for malfunction.",
      "Here is a video of our first working prototype.",
      "Here are some of our earliest sketches!",
      "Over the past 7 months, we have been hard at work preparing to bring you the world's best portable multi-dispenser. We truly believe that this is the future of traveling more with less while also helping the environment.",
      "We can't wait for you to be the first to get your hands on the GoBout. Feel free to check out our rewards. Thank you so much for your support, and hey just Go Be Out with GoBout, the world's best portable multi-dispenser.",

Each challenge we faced was an opportunity for us to refine our design, with each iteration edging us closer to our goal.",

Note that fees will rise with the number of units purchased. For example, shipping for the Family Pack may cost approximately $15-$25USD. For remote countries, express shipping services like FedEx/DHL/TNT may push costs up to $50USD.",
      "Thanks to the support from our past backers, we have expanded our business to the US and Australia in the past few years. We have partnered up with Amazon as our logistic partner in these countries.

It's been one of our most popular products for years, so we've decided to make a newer, better TV - The TinyTV\u00ae 2!  More screen resolution, rotary knobs, remote control support, USB-C and more.  To push the envelope as far as possible, we created a TinyTV that is insanely small - the grape sized TinyTV\u00ae Mini!",
      "The TinyTV comes preloaded with videos and works right out of the box - but the fun comes when you load your own videos.  Just plug your TinyTV into your computer via USB and easily load your favorite videos.  Adjust the volume and surf between channels by turning the knobs on the TinyTV 2, or top buttons on the TinyTV Mini, or by using the Tiny Remote control.",

      "We offer an easy to use video converter that can be used on Windows or Mac to convert standard video types (like MP4s) to files that can be played on the TinyTVs. You can also customize effects like static and video looping easily from this program.

In 2012 we launched the TinyDuino project on Kickstarter which greatly exceeded our expectations (and raised about 1100% of the goal). This let us set up our own manufacturing operation in Akron, OH, where we assemble, test, and ship all of our products.",
      "I guess you could say we've done this a few times. In 2014 we launched the TinyScreen on Kickstarter, which raised over $128,000. In 2015 we launched the Tiny Arcade on Kickstarter, which raised over $75,000. Both were shipped out completely in under 6 months. In 2019 we launched our Wireling Platform on Kickstarter, even tinier boards that remove the hassle of breadboarding so that you can prototype projects fast and easy. Wireling raised over $34,000.",
      "And in 2021 we launched our most successful campaign - Thumby - The Tiny Playable Keychain, which raised close to $300,000 between the Kickstarter and follow-up campaign.  We built and shipped over 10,000 Thumbys as part of this in the spring of 2022, all built in our Akron, Ohio facility.",
      "Outside of our Kickstarter campaigns, we've released over 100 new products (mostly add-ons for the TinyDuino and Wireling platform), learned a tremendous amount about manufacturing quality and reliable products, and have fine-tuned our production process. Thanks to this amazing Maker community we've manufactured and shipped out over 150,000 boards since starting operations in 2012 to thousands of customers in 60+ countries.",

We are a proud supporter of the Open Source Hardware Association and have helped sponsor the Open Hardware Summit since 2013.",
      "The TinyTV 2 and TinyTV Mini are the latest in family of the TinyTV products, which began as a hobby project over five years ago using the TinyCircuits TinyDuino family. Yashusi Enari, a TinyCircuits customer in Tokyo, Japan, discovered the TinyScreen+ and began creating his own tiny miniatures with these tiny screens.  One of these projects was a retro miniature 3D printed television set, which he called the MAME-TV (Mame translates to \"Bean\" in English).",
      "The project turned out so well and impressed his friends, that Yashusi decided to start making more of these to sell to other miniature enthusiasts at events like Maker Faire Tokyo.  He created a company named Panda Precision to do this, and started to collaborate with us at TinyCircuits to improve the kit.  He continued to 3D print and hand build all of the MAME-TVs in his Tokyo apartment, and it became increasingly popular where he had difficulty keeping up with demand.",
      "Sadly, Yashusi was diagnosed with brain cancer in 2018 and began undergoing intensive treatment, which made it difficult to continue with his project that he was so passionate about.  In early 2019, a tumor was found in his brain, and he asked us to continue this project on his behalf.",
      "We then worked together on an improved version of the MAME-TV, which could scale up and be made available to more people - this work lead to the TinyTV DIY Kit.",
      "Our friend Yashusi Enari passed away on May 1st, 2019.  We miss him, and dedicate this project to his memory.",
      "The MAME-TV project still lives on through Yashusi's friend Guru Hoshi in Japan, who continues making these amazing custom MAME-TVs and continuing this project here.",
      "Launched in late 2019, the TinyTV DIY Kit allowed people to create their own TinyTV, load their own videos, and paint the TV to look however they wanted.  Built upon the TinyCircuits TinyDuino family, this kit has been extremely popular and well received.",
      "While the kit aspect of this is fun for a lot of people, we did hear from others who would prefer it already assembled, and easier to load their own videos on.  So we began working on the next generation TinyTV platform which we are launching as the TinyTV2 and TinyTV Mini.",
      "By backing this campaign, you support open-source hardware and software.  The good news is we've done most of the hard work - all hardware and software designs are complete. All that's left to do is the final production, and your funding helps us with this process. $15,000 will help us purchase components in bulk, keep cost down, and offer the TinyTV 2 and TinyTV Mini at a low price.",

      "Don't you just hate it when your powerbank indicator is just a few small LED lights that keep changing each time you check it? After reading the feedback we received from thousands of Flash backers, we discovered that the main request from backers was a screen that would allow them to accurately determine how much battery was left remaining in their powerbank. We went straight back to the drawing board to see how we could incorporate this suggestion to improve the Flash experience. We\u2019re super excited to share Flash Pro Plus has an 1.3\" OLED display giving you real time information about not only just the battery percentage remaining, but the power output from each port measured in Watts and Amps when charging a device as well as the running temperature.",
      "We've increased the battery capacity of Flash Pro Plus by 25% from 20000mAh to 25000mAh whilst only increasing the size by 5%. The additional battery capacity gives you that extra juice you've been asking for but in a compact size that's still super convenient to carry around with you everywhere.",
      "With the release of iPhone 12, this is a must have feature for those who prefer wireless charging versus wired charging. A recent poll with our previous Flash backers showed 47% wanted to see the addition of this feature. Flash Pro Plus is capable of 15W magnetic wireless charging for Magsafe compatible devices and 20W charging when connected to a device via a cable. Just place your iPhone 12 on top of the wireless charging pad and it will magnetically attach to help your device remain in place. The magnetic wireless charger is also able to support up to 10W wireless charging for all other devices e.g. Airpods Pro",
      "Flash Pro Plus has 3 x USB-C ports to support high powered charging to a range of devices at the same time. A single USB-C port is able to support 100W Power Delivery 3.0 while the additional USB-C ports are able to reach 60W and 20W respectively. Each USB-C port also supports the maximum charging speed of 20W for the iPhone 12 range. This allows you to charge a large laptop (e.g. 15\"/16\" MacBook Pro or Dell XPS 13/15), a second laptop (Macbook 13\") and a flagship phone (iPhone 12 Pro) all at the same time at maximum speed. Configure your set-up with endless possibilities.",
      "Flash Pro has a specially designed USB-A port with Android users in mind with an increased power output ofrom 22.5W by 50% to 50W to support the latest proprietary fast charging technology including Oneplus (50W), OPPO SVOOC (50W), as well as Huawei Super Charge (22.5W).",
      "Users of these brands know the frustrations they must go through as normally you only experience these proprietary fast charge speeds when you purchase the original brand's charger or power bank.",
      "Wireless charging has been upgraded from 10W to 15W for our Flash Pro to support wireless charging for all wireless devices including phones and Apple Airpods. Wireless charging works through electromagnetic induction with a sender coil in the powerbank and a receiver coil built into the back of the phone. The wireless charging pad will be able to support 10W charging for iPhone 12 devices (Flash Pro Plus version supports 15W fast charge and can be upgraded for only $10).",
      "Each wireless charging pad also has foreign object detection (FOD) to ensure safety. This feature allows Flash Pro to detect if a foreign object, such as metal, is nearby or on its surface and stop charging. Without FOD, the charger will continue to heat up causing the object placed on or near the wireless charger to become very hot, which could lead to serious injuries.",
      "Please note: It is not recommended to use the wireless charger when the power bank is at less than 2% and this is a standard with all wireless chargers. It is not compatible with Samsung Galaxy Watches as Samsung has chosen to use a charging coil that's different to Qi compatible devices.  For Samsung S21 Ultra, Flash Pro can support up to 10W as the Samsung 15W wireless charging protocol has not been fully decrypted yet. The wireless charger on Flash Pro is also not compatible with Apple Watches as it doesn't have a dual coil wireless charger. (Flash Pro Plus supports Apple Watch wireless charging and can be upgraded for only $10).",
      "For our Apple Watch fans, Flash Pro Plus now has a separate charging pad to charge your Apple watch. We've also doubled the charging speed from 2.5W to 5W so your watch will always be ready to go when you are. As an Apple user myself, I know first-hand the frustration of having to always carry the wireless pad around since its so hard to find wireless pads and powerbanks that work with the Apple watch and if they do, they are usually very expensive.  The charging pad has a magnet to ensure your watch magnetically stays in place.",
      "Please note the Apple Watch charging pad is not compatible with Samsung Galaxy Watches as Samsung has chosen to use a charging coil that's different to Apple Watches.",
      "Our power banks have been built with a temperature thermistor which helps to control and monitor the temperature of the power bank when it is in use to ensure it operates within a safe operating temperature.  This reduces the chance of abnormal heating while it is charging, improves the battery life of the power bank, protects your devices and internal circuitry and also ensures user safety.",
      "If the temperature exceeds the temperature set by our program, in order to protect the circuit and devices, Flash Pro Plus will go into power reduction and automatic shutdown processing.\nFor example,  if the temperature reaches 55\u2103, C1 will reduce to 60W output and shut down automatically if it reaches60\u2103.",
      "Flash Pro Plus is now able to detect and charge low voltage devices such as headphones and vapes from each port, allowing you to charge an even greater range of devices.",
      "Charge Flash Pro Plus and all your devices at the same time!",
      "To save your even more time, Flash Pro Plus supports pass through charging so you can charge your devices and Flash Pro Plus at the same time through a single power outlet. Running low on battery? You can charge up to 5 devices while charging up Flash Pro at the same time meaning your 5 devices can be charged over and over.",
      "Recharge Flash to 80% in 45 minutes, or empty to 100% (full charge) in only 1 hr 10 min.",
      "A huge battery capacity means nothing if it takes forever to charge. You don't want your backup battery to spend more time recharging itself than charging your devices. With its 100W USB-C Power Delivery 3.0 input and Panasonic\u2122 graphene composite batteries, it will take only 1 hr 10min for a full charge of 25000 mAh. This means you'll have a powerbank that's already ready to go before you are.",
      "Please note: With different brands of 100W adapters, different 5A USB-C cables, and different test environments (such as hot and cold locations), the test results may be a little bit different.",

Conveniently carry the only battery that matters, that can power all your devices, wherever you go, without fear of ever losing power ensuring your life stays uninterrupted while you're always on the go.",
      "Why our customers love our Flash Powerbank!",
      "The magic to Flash Pro Plus's incredible specs is through incorporating the same batteries that were used in Flash. Instead of 4, there are 5 x 21700 Panasonic\u2122 Lithium Polymer Graphene Composite Battery Cells for the larger battery capacity. Other brands use Lithium Ion batteries which has lower energy density, is 20 - 30% cheaper to make and has a larger form factor.",
      "These batteries have been specially designed a pioneer in the electric vehicle space in partnership with Pansonic who is the manufacturer. Only launched in March 2019 and still not widely available publicly, this unique battery is presently the highest energy density battery in the world, 20% more than its predecessor.",
      "We've chosen Graphene as it's the world's most conductive material with ultra-high thermal conductivity and Graphite films are widely used in thermal applications for mobile phones and other high-power devices. These Panasonic li-po graphene composite batteries comprise of more than 15% graphene and graphite which is the ideal amount to have in a battery. Any less and the electricity conductivity will be reduced and any more the battery will be unable to function. This is a proprietary industry trade secret of the battery designer and manufacturer.",
      "Aside from upgrading the tech in Flash Pro Plus, we've also improved the design by making changes based on feedback we've received so we can enhance the user's experience.",
      "Flash 2.0 versus Flash Pro Plus",
      "We wanted to make the most powerful USB-C battery pack so we put in not only 3 x USB-C port but we also added 1 x USB-A port and 2 wireless pads giving Flash Pro Plus a total power output of 190W so that it will be compatible with all your modern USB devices.",

      "Final prototype of Flash Pro",
      "Dimensions of Flash Pro Plus",
      "Dimensions of Flash Pro",
      "One of the most useful features of the graphene composite features is a battery that lasts longer than traditional batteries. Each Flash Pro powerbank is rated to last 2,000 life cycles vs only 500 cycles of the closest competitors. This means Each Flash Pro has a 5 years+ battery life, which means you can use Each Flash Pro every single day for 5 years and it would still seem like its brand new. WOW!",
      "Through laboratory testing equipment, we've tested the battery to last 1,836 cycles and still have a capacity above 87% (a life cycle is considered above 80%), so in reality the life cycle is far greater than 2,000 but we are being conservative in our statement of 2,000.",
      "We've also improved the discharge rate from 350 days to 395 days. Discharge rate refers to the amount of battery that is lost each day when the powerbank is is not in use. This means Flash Pro Plus's battery will last more than year even if it's not used. Neat right?",
      "While designing a high capacity battery, we still wanted a highly compact and portable solution. We've chosen Aircraft grade anodised aluminium as the shell enclosure material due to being strong yet thin and malleable enough to follow the lines of the battery cells, wrapping and protecting it with minimal space wastage. Aluminium is also a very good at heat dissipation to keep the battery cool at all times. The minimalist aluminium design is efficient, functional and matches the MacBook perfectly. Overall the entire aluminium body now has a smoother finish with edges and rounded corners for a more premium feel.",
      "What's convenient is you can charge Flash Pro Plus with your existing Macbook 15\" or 16\" Pro wall charger at 100% max speed. Flash Pro Plus is also compatible with all other standard USB-C chargers already used by your devices including Macbook 12 or 13\", USB-C, Dell XPS 13/15 and more.",
      "For those who don't carry any of these devices, we also offer a range of wall chargers capable of outputting the 100W needed to charge Flash Pro Plus at full speed.",
      "Not only fast and powerful, the Graphene battery technology also makes Flash Pro Plus the world\u2019s safest power bank by allowing it to fast charge at low temperatures compared to standard batteries. Flash Pro Plus will never go above 60\u00b0C (140\u00b0F) unlike competitor power banks which can reach 70\u00b0C (167\u00b0F) ensuring it is safer and also longer lasting.  You'll feel very comfortable knowing that this baby won't heat up or bulge over time like you see in many of your older USB devices.",
      "Graphene composite batteries have much smaller internal resistance and better conductivity than traditional li-po batteries. Graphene composite is also added to both the positive and negative poles of the battery cell to further increase the conductivity. Due to the unique thermal dissipation properties of Graphene, no further cooling mechanisms such as heat sinks are required allowing us to keep Flash Pro Plus as thin and light as possible.",
      "Our thermal imaging camera showing Flash Pro Plus is still cooler than a smaller competitor",
      "A company's battery chemical structure is a trade secret which isn't shared publicly or to most of a company's staff. One major reason is other companies will copy their technology which is why many leading brands only put li-po only on their battery. This stands for \"lithium polymer\" which means it\u2019s a lithium-ion (li-ion) battery with additives of other special materials one of which in this case is Graphene which is able to significantly alter the batteries properties enough to differentiate it. This is the battery chemical composition report for the Panasonic 21700 batteries found inside Flash Pro Plus:",
      "At the request of the battery companies we have withheld full details of 3 of the ingredients. Though with some research you can easily discover 1 of the compounds found in all electric vehicle batteries is Cobalt. Unsurprisingly there are over a dozen ingredients that make up this complicated graphene battery which is the result of a decades of battery technology research and testing- hence why battery companies like to keep this mixture a company trade secret.",
      "In order to achieve international certification for safe use, all our powerbanks are put through a number of rigorous industrial tests to ensure Flash Pro Plus can withstand daily use- even in the most extreme of circumstances.",
      "Each powerbank is placed into a temperature chamber and exposed to extreme temperatures of -10\u00b0C to 65\u00b0C. In the event Flash Pro Plus is exposed to these temperatures, once its been moved to the safe operating temperature it will work perfectly fine.",

      "Squarock: Portable all-in-one audio equipment for podcast, live streaming, recording, music creation",
      "Are you interested in content creation, podcasting, live streaming, music creation, audio recording?",
      "Are you suffering from poor sound quality from non-professional audio interfaces?",
      "Are you interrupted by sounds from the surrounding environment  and have to lower the microphone gain?",
      "Do you spend a lot of time checking the plugs for each audio device?",
      "Are you putting up with the unreasonably high price of brand-name audio ports, but their functions are monotonous and average?",
      "Yes? You may need our Commander M1 audio interface and the audio equipment bundle. They will help you increase productivity, take your skills to the next level. It allows you to focus on creating content instead of fighting with some emotionless device. Get ready to enjoy your immersive creations without worrying about running out of battery.",
      "Integrated Device: Squarock Commander M1 audio interface is professional-grade equipment to produce your audio. It is a composed of a sound mixer, sound card, voice-changer, and sound effects board. People usually use it for podcasts, live streaming, music creation, audio recording, online games and more.",
      "Wide Compatibility: Commander M1 has a widely compatible audio interface.

PC: Windows, Mac OS\u2026 iPhone/Tablet: iOS, Android, Windows Phone and other systems.",
      "Multipurpose: M1 audio interface acts as an extension of your PC or phone. As long as it is connected to your PC or phone, it will serve as an audio input & output device. You can use it with almost all applications. It is free-drive, plug and play. We specifically designed this to free you from the tedious setup of traditional audio equipment, allowing you to focus on your audio production. It is ideal for use with popular software applications and network platforms such as, OBS, Audacity, Adobe Audition, and video platforms like YouTube, Twitch, Tiktok, Facebook Live, and Uplive.",
      "The button to the right of the power button turns on the screen and button backlights. There are 4 levels of the display lights. In level 1, the screen and button backlights are brightest. In level 2, the button backlights and screen are at medium level. In level 3, the screen and button backlights are at the lowest level of brightness. In level 4, the button backlights are off, and the screen backlight at the lowest level of brightness. The system default is level 1. You can see all of the indication icons changing on the LED screen.",
      "There are 6 small knobs on the top of the M1 panel: TRE, MID, BASS knobs are for manually adjusting the tone of your voice from the microphone. The PITCH knob is for adjusting the pitch of the 4 voice-changer modes and HOST, SING, OST 3 sound modes.The MUSIC knob is for adjusting the volume of accompanying music (this includes Bluetooth music and wired input music from the MUSIC port). MONITOR is for adjusting the volume of the headphones and speaker. 2 large knobs. REVERB adjusts the reverb/echo effects of your voice from microphones. OUTPUT is for adjusting the output audio volume to PHONE or PC ports.",
      "In the middle of the bottom half of the panel, there are 3 slider knobs. The left slider is for adjusting the volume of MIC L group (MIC L1, MIC L2). The mute button is for mute the two mics. The right slider and right mute button are doing the same for MIC R group (MIC R1, MIC R2). The middle slider is for adjusting the volume of instrument.",
      "The red +48V button has nothing to do with the INST slider. The +48V button is the on/off 48V phantom power. It will add 48 volts to the left and right mics (MICL1 and MIC R1). MIC L1 port and MIC R1 port are for 48V condenser microphones. Only when you open red +48V button, the two MIC ports will start work. MIC L2 and MIC R2 are for 5V condenser microphones or dynamic microphones. The microphones in our bundles are condenser. If you want to use your own dynamic mic, you need to switch MIC SETTING to dynamic.",
      "The left 12 silicone buttons are functions. Among the 12 buttons, the 4 black buttons are the 7 sound modes (only change mode for the sound which comes from microphones): Male, female, child, robbot, host, sing and original sound tape. Press the button to switch the mode.",
      "The red COMMANDER button implements all the setting of MUSIC, MONITOR, REVERB, OUTPUT, MIC L, MIC R, INST and sound mode buttons/knobs. It will set to a professionally designed default setting created by professional audio engineers. It is to help the user quickly start to use the audio interface.Bluetooth is for turning on/off the connection of the Bluetooth device. MUTE silences all sound.Press the DNR to switch to levels 1 and 2 of noise reduction. AUTO TUNE is for switching the microphone to auto tune. It included 12 modes: Ab, A, Bb, B, C, Db, D, Eb, E, F, Gb, G. MUSIC ONLY removes the singer`s voice from a song, leaving only the background music. When you use a computer with M1, if you turn on LOOP BACK, the sound from computer will not output to M1. During live streaming, your audience will not hear the sound from your computer. SIDE CHAIN lowers the volume of accompanying music when you talk from the microphone in order to highlight your speaking.",
      "The red COMMANDER button implements all the setting of MUSIC, MONITOR, REVERB, OUTPUT, MIC L, MIC R, INST and sound mode buttons/knobs. It will set to a professionally designed default setting created by professional audio engineers. It is to help the user immediately start using the audio interface.",
      "Based on past sales experience, we know that many YouTubers and podcasters need to record long intro clips, and play it on repeat at the beginning or end of their audio/video. However, most competitors` audio interface only have 1MB to 5MB storage volume. They can record and store the audio for only 10 to 40 seconds. And their sound quality is greatly reduced compared to the M1. Their sample rate is only 11KHz to 24KHz. Our Commander M1 has a built-in 64MB super large flash storage. Large storage volume allows us to keep important and necessary things. We can ensure that the saved audio sample rate is kept above 44.1KHz (CD quality). Also you can record and store more than 800 seconds of audio in our audio interface`s DIY sound effect buttons. We provide 16 removable tags that make it easy for users to tag each DIY SFX button. We made sure to far surpass the competition and guarantee customer satisfaction.",
      "The design inspiration for this feature also comes from our after-sales service experience. Many customers ask our after-sales service team why their audio interface doesn\u2019t output the sound, or why they can\u2019t hear any sound from earphones. As our customer service patiently helped them find the reason, the customer suddenly found that the plug was not fully inserted. This is a simple problem that many competitors overlook. To prevent our users from facing this situation, we added the connection detection system on the M1 display screen. It can help you check the connection status of PC, PHONE, INSTRUMENT and CHARGE. If they are connected, you will see their icons on the top line of LED screen. If you cannot see the icon, that indicates your device is poorly connected or not connected at all.",
      "STU1 and STU1+ microphone kit",
      "We have 2 kinds of microphones for the bundle. STU1 is a 5V cardioid condenser microphone, the mic capsule is 16mm. The response frequency range is from 50Hz to 18KHz.  Maximum SPL is 120dB. S/N ratio is 70dB. Sensitivity is -38\u00b12dB (0dB=1V/Pa at 1KHz). STU1+ is a 48V cardioid condenser microphone, the mic capsule is 25mm. The response frequency range is from 20Hz to 20KHz. Maximum SPL is 134dB. S/N ratio is 70dB. Sensitivity is -40\u00b12dB (0dB=1V/Pa at 1KHz).",
      "We have specially designed the microphone boom arm and mic shock mount to maximize ease of use and to optimize the appearance. It's not the same as a traditional mic stand and shock mount. Our product does not have any unnecessary parts that are often a burden on the customer. After you adjust it to the proper posture, it will remain in place and looks like a work of art. All of this, of course, is absolutely in line with the latest aesthetic sense of symmetry. There are 5 small cable holders to help you to hide the microphone cable in to the gap between the dual arms. This design greatly improves the appearance of your desktop.",
      "D1 monitor headphones",
      "Our headphones are professional-grade monitor headphones. They have two 50mm speaker driver units. The impedance is 32\u03a9, the sensitivity is 98\u00b13dB. The frequency response range is 10Hz-38KHz. We designed it to have a sharp clean look that is pleasing to the eye, while being an absolute comfort to the ears. It can pick up the lowest and highest frequencies, as it is much more sensitive than the human ear. You will experience complete sound immersion with the D1 Monitor Headphones.",
      "The headphones have two extra-large (inner diameter 65mm, outer diameter 100mm) ear covers. And they are made of extremely comfortable soft sponge. It comes with a 4 meter coiled headphone cable. There is a lock affixed on the connection of the cable terminal to avoid accidentally pulling out the headphone plug during use. This is one of the most common customer complaints we have solved. Because the cables are super strong and super long (3.5mm diameter, 12ft) and the spring like cord is not easy to tangle, you can get on with your recording without having to worry about the cord disconnecting, tangling, or getting in the way.",
      "Whether your hearing is above average or normal, you\u2019ll get an immersive listening experience unlike anything you\u2019ve ever had before.",
      "We have overcome many difficulties while perfecting overall appearance, the fine structural details, structural design, electrical engineering, software engineering and audio engineering. After 11 months of design and development and many, many iterations, we finally completed the first version. We have modified the appearance and structural design of the audio interface more than 300+ times. Externally, we went through 19 major changes. These caused us to restart over and over again. For the electronic engineering and software engineering, we also went through 600+ attempts. We now want you to hear what perfection sounds like.",
      "Pictures alone can not tell the story of the tireless dedication of our audio engineers. The sound quality of the Commander M1 has to be heard to be understood. Making each audio channel successfully cooperate with each function forced us to make the impossible possible. The electrical and audio engineers needed to solve a maze of issues to come up with a sound quality that is second to none.",
      "How choose add-ons?",
      "Step 1: Click one perk of sound board (get this perk).",
      "Step 2: Continue to payment.",
      "Step 3: You will see the list of add-ons.",
      "***Note: Each COMMANDER M1 audio interface can match two STU1 (5V) and two STU1+ (48V) microphones, and two headphones.",

In addition, the secret blend of other sound waves enables your body and mind to sync seamlessly with your natural sleep cycle and enjoy your continuous rest.",
      "Banala Sense is a patent-pending sleep-inducing device with ground-breaking, isochronic sound technology that not only helps you get to sleep faster but also encourages better quality sleep.",
      "Its proprietary Smart Sleep-Cycle-Inducing System starts with the Theta Isochronic tone to slow the chaotic brain activity, prepare you for the sleep state, and help you fall asleep quickly. Then, Delta Isochronic waves make sure you stay asleep for a longer time. At the same time, the secret blend of other waves ensures a peaceful rest.",
      "Regular usage of Banala Sense will positively impact your sleep cycle and gradually restore it. As a result, not only will you sleep better, but you'll also feel more rested and energetic during the day.",
      "If you want to focus on the project, relax from the long day, or just feel good, the Banala Sense is always there for you.

      "Isochronic tones is used for getting brain waves to sync with a specific stimulus. This stimulus is typically an audio or visual pattern. They are incredibly effective in improving sleep quality and helping people achieve better, more restful sleep.",
      "But, if you're struggling to get to sleep, your brain is likely producing too much Beta activity.",
      "Banala Sense, with its patent-pending Isochronic Tone technology, helps to reduce Beta activity and increase Delta and Theta frequency range. Thus, ensuring you experience a better, faster, and deeper sleep.",
      "Our brainwave activity reflects our mood. For example, if slower brainwaves are dominant, we feel sleepy, relaxed, or dreamy.",
      "Brainwave speed is measured in Hertz (Hz) and relates to the cycling movement per second. So a 5Hz brainwave simply means cycling at a five times per second rate. And Brainwave Entrainment Methods, like isochronic tones, stimulate and produce more brain activity of a specific frequency or range, making that more dominant.",
      "Theta waves occur from 4Hz to 8Hz. They usually happen in a state of deep relaxation or drifting in and out of sleep.",
      "Delta waves are very slow and low in frequency (0.5Hz-4Hz). You produce the most delta activity during your deepest sleep. During delta, your body does most of its healing and regenerating of cells.",
      "58% of individuals who used delta simulations every night within a month reported improved sleep quality and reduced fatigue.",
      "Banala Sense is our new product in the series of Banala, following Banala Lite and Banala Alarm Clock. Banala Lite and Banala Alarm Clock have proven their safety and benefits with 2,409 backers and over 50,000 users so far.",
      "Banala is natural and super safe for humans and pets. It can be used by everyone at every age and doesn\u2019t have any contraindications.",
      "The difference between Banala from other Brain Entrainment methods like Binaural Beat or electric brain-inducing is that the sound from Banala is natural. Banala uses isochronic sound technology, which is iso soundwave. Like the ambient noises in your room from the air conditioner or fan. Banala adds another natural soundwave to the room ambiance and instead of an un-organize soundwave like the one from the air-conditioner or fan, Banala emits a soundwave that is curated and researched to help people in the room sleep better. (and, of course, focus, relax, and feel good.)",
      "The technology was developed based on the academic thesis and academic paper that the founder, Kridsakon, studied and published in 2012. In Chulalongkorn University thesis and IEEE paper publication \u201c2012 Tenth International Conference on ICT and Knowledge Engineering,\u201c. This knowledge of Brain-Computer Interfaces and brainwaves allows Kridsakon to create his first product BrainPlus, the brain training using EEG, which is now used in various hospitals in Thailand\u2014helping people to fight dementia. The project has been funded by the \u201cTechnology and Innovation-Based Enterprise Development Fund\u201d and the \u201cNational Science and Technology Development\u201d.",
      "We all have different sleep needs and patterns, and it can be tough to get into a good sleep routine. But once you do, it makes a huge difference in your day-to-day life, repairing and restoring our bodies \u2014 like nature's way of rebooting us.\nA standard sleep pattern typically consists of five stages of sleep, each alternating between different cycles \u2014 the slow-wave and REM (paradoxical) sleep phases.\nStages one to two are light sleep, three to four are deeper sleep, and the fifth stage is REM sleep, often referred to as the rapid eye movement stage or the dream state.",
      "The estimated shipping date is October 2022. Due to the current volatility of shipping costs, we will calculate and collect shipping after the campaign ends, close to our ship date. We will collect your survey and shipping costs through BackerKit. This method will keep costs down since we\u2019ll know how many units are going to each shipping zone.\nWe expect the shipping prices per package to be $12 - $20. Please note that this is just an estimate, and the final shipping cost will be determined at the time of fulfillment in October.",
      "Banala Life is a company dedicated to helping people worldwide sleep better. Based on extensive and insightful research, we offer solutions that improve the well-being of our users. Our mission is to defeat insomnia once and for all.\nOur products, the Banala Alarm Clock and Banala Lite launched on Kickstarter in 2018 and 2019. We received over 2,500 pledges from those campaigns and have already shipped tens of thousands of products worldwide to over a hundred countries.\nWe have poured our hearts and soul into this project because we're passionate about ensuring everyone benefits from the healing powers of deep sleep.

      "\"This book provides an overview of many constructs in the Python programming language in a fun way through the eyes of kids and would be a great supplement for anyone interested in learning Python. The examples are centered around two kids who are writing programs to document their day. For anyone learning Python, both adults and kids, this book helps to show practically how to think like a computer as a person walks through everyday activities.\" - Jeffrey Miller, Professor of Computer Science Practice, University of Southern California (USC)",
      "The concept of Learn Python through Nursery Rhymes and Fairy Tales is similar to these books- but you already know the stories. :) I can't wait to bring these classic cherished tales into a new form and deliver a beautiful book to you.",

One day, under the counter working on a leak, frustrated with the nut and bolt prowess of the multi-tool I always carried, the idea for the Omnilock\u2122 began to take shape in my head. I decided to try and design my dream multi-tool, one that could take advantage of the new wrench design to the fullest.

      "Mid Motor|Torque Sensor|Smart Display|75km Range|39 lbs(18kg)|Hidden Removable Battery|Electric Bike",
      "The bicycle, first invented in 1817, has been associated with adventure, exercise, freedom, and movement.  Some bicycling purists have scoffed at the role that electric bikes can play in this journey.  However, at EUNORAU, we know that electric bikes give people the chance to go further ,explore more, move more, and have more freedom. They epitomize the meaning of bike life and offer so much more than the average bike.",
      "Electric bicycles can largely be grouped into two categories: Those powered by hub motors and those powered by mid-drive motors. The former is generally seen as more affordable due to the simpler technology, while the latter are often increasingly premium offerings that employ more sophisticated drivetrains. But the EUNORAU D6 electric bicycle brings that mid-drive performance in at a hub-motor price.",
      "We\u2019ve done this before and now we are doing it again! Last year, we\u2019ve successfully got 103 riders\u2019 attention within a short time. The project collected more than 260K dollars and was delivered successfully.",
      "Most mid-drive electric bicycles start at a minimum of $3,000, with the price only increasing from there.",
      "They become even more expensive when they include a torque sensor, which is a more sophisticated way to engage the electric pedal assist to result in more natural assistance that better mimics human input.",
      "The newly unveiled EUNORAU D6 is a mid-drive road-style electric bike at a surprisingly affordable promotional price of $1,199. That\u2019s even lower than most of the go-to hub motor e-bikes on the market right now.",
      "An electric bike with Pedal Assist Sensors automatically turns on the motor when you pedal. With pedal assist, you do not need to use a throttle to control the motor. There are two basic types of Pedal Sensors: CADENCE which measures IF you are pedaling and TORQUE which measures HOW HARD you are pedaling.",
      "The basic cadence sensor uses a magnet on the crank, it turns the motor ON when you start pedaling and turns it OFF when you stop pedaling. It works more or less like a switch. Using the cadence sensor, you have to control the boost level and speed by adjusting the assist mode manually up and down. Most basic e-bikes offer a cadence pedal sensor. The advantage of this sensor is that it's an inexpensive way to get some sort of pedal assist onto the bike, but the disadvantage is that the pedal assistance can feel jerky, laggy, and counterintuitive. Also if you want to pedal faster than the motor is spinning, the motor will actively work against your efforts.",
      "The torque sensor is a totally different technology that uses a  precision strain gauge. It measures your actual force on the pedal, sampling at 1,000 times per second over the entire pedal stroke. A torque sensor measures how hard the rider is pedaling to determine how much electric power to push to the bike. The harder you pedal, the more power it gives to the motor. If you pedal lighter, less power goes to the motor. It makes this adjustment in real-time, so it is technically amplifying your every input and makes the rider feel BIONIC! Many higher-end e-bikes use torque sensors and in some countries, cadence-only sensors are not allowed to be sold. The disadvantage is the cost is significantly higher to implement this technology as the precision component is relatively more expensive. EUNORAU D6 is use this torque sensor!",
      "The EUNORAU app consists of many smart functions such as Calorie consumption, trip records, social networking, OTA Update. All in all, they make your journey with D6 always fun and motivating.",
      "D6 comes in two sizes & four color options so everyone\u2014no matter your gender or body type\u2014can ride a bike that fits and feels amazing.",
      "The construction of the bike is exquisite. The welds are so smooth that the frame almost looks as if it was cast in one piece. The electrical wiring and brake lines are neatly routed inside the frame tubes. The battery is nicely integrated to the point where you almost don\u2019t even notice that the bike is electric.",
      "The EUNORAU D6 isn\u2019t some high-powered e-bike designed for thrill rides. Instead, it\u2019s got modest specs for modest riders. And it was only 18kg!",
      "This is very much a commuter bike intended for urban riding, and it feels fitting for both avid cyclists and occasional riders who want an easygoing electric bike.",
      "There\u2019s no suspension and the 700c x 35c cyclocross tires aren\u2019t terribly wide, but that\u2019s par for the course if you\u2019re used to road bikes. On smooth paths, it rides like a dream.",
      "The EUNORAU D6 tops out at 32 km/h (20 mph), US version; 25km/h(16mph), EU version. And so it\u2019s a Class 1 e-bike.No throttle, this is legal almost all over the world.",
      "You can pedal up past 20 mph, but you\u2019ll be on your own after the electric assist comes out.\nThe bikes\u2019 36V 10Ah battery isn\u2019t overly large at just 360 Wh. That\u2019s a bit below average compared to many electric bikes on the market today, but its saving grace is how nicely it integrates into the frame. And its cruising range can reach an astonishing 75km.",

      "But now, due to an unforeseen funding quagmire which interfered with our manufacturing, marketing, R&D, and advocacy efforts, our future is at risk. We\u2019re not giving up, and the truth is prevailing as we relaunch our company with Court protection!",

      "This is an Open-Source Healing Movement. We're not just launching a campaign. We're inviting you in. Your contribution fuels transparency, participation, and collective power. Help shape what healing can be, together!",
      "Topricin is a legacy brand with over 30 years of proven results. We\u2019ve been on shelves across the country; in Whole Foods, CVS, Walgreens, Sprouts, and thousands of natural retailers and independent pharmacies nationwide.",
      "Our products have received patents, are regulated as homeopathic drugs by the FDA, and are recommended by doctors and healthcare professionals nationwide.",
      "We\u2019re not crowdfunding because we\u2019re unproven...",
      "We\u2019re crowdfunding because - we were caught in an unfortunate set of financial circumstances that has prevented us from supplying you (our loyal customers) with the best topical pain relief products available anywhere - but, we\u2019re choosing to rise\u2014with help from YOU, our committed, amazing community who wants and needs us to protect this very special product that has helped so many people over so many years.",
      "This raise is:",
      "Inventory financing meets community activism",
      "A way to keep natural, opioid-free relief in people\u2019s hands",
      "A statement of ownership and mission from those who care most: our customers",
      "Here's the truth: we had a deal with a funding partner who promised and committed in writing to help us accelerate our growth.",
      "Those promises and commitments were not honored. What began as a growth deal turned into a stranglehold. Funding was withheld. Agreements were violated. And when we tried to clarify the nature of the relationship, and asked for promises and commitments to be honored, our partner tried to seize our assets and take control of the business.",
      "To protect Topricin\u2019s mission and end this untenable relationship, we filed for Chapter 11 restructuring. It was the only legal path to cancel a damaging IP agreement and remove an individual who had no intention of keeping their word.",
      "When this relationship collapsed, we were left without adequate inventory and manufacturing, but we knew we had options\u2026",

      "We create \u201cbetter for you\u201d products for people tired of pills, side effects, and addiction risk. We believe in:",
      "Chronic pain is more than a physical burden. It eats away at your mood, focus, and energy. It affects relationships. Productivity. Sleep. Confidence. It makes joy harder to reach, and life harder to live.",
      "Topricin was created because we understand this. We\u2019ve seen how the right kind of relief\u2014safe, effective, natural\u2014can bring people back to themselves. It\u2019s like offering a Fountain of Youth solution for those lacking mobility and a pain-free existence. Our original formula was developed by a decorated Marine Corps veteran who refused to accept his diagnosis of CTS - Carpal Tunnel Syndrome - that prevented him from sleeping and functioning, so he found a solution for his own ailments.",
      "This campaign is for every person who struggles to feel like themselves again. It\u2019s for every person who\u2019s ever been told, \u201cYou\u2019ll just have to live with it.\u201d We\u2019re here to say: No. You don\u2019t. We\u2019ve got you.  And we're here to make your life better.",

      "At Topricin, we\u2019ve spent 30 years refining formulas that are:",
      "Around the world - in Europe and India - homeopathy is a mainstream part of care. In the U.S., we\u2019re working to bring that same respect and access to the forefront, because healing without harm isn\u2019t a luxury. It\u2019s a right.",
      "Turn on the TV, and it\u2019s wall-to-wall drug ads. Cacophonous, confusing, and often terrifying, listing more side effects than benefits.",
      "Big Pharma is in your living room, on your radio, and constantly in your ears. But what if there were another way? What if wellness could be simpler? Clearer? Kinder to the body?",
      "That\u2019s what we stand for. That\u2019s what this campaign supports. A return to human-scale healing, WITHOUT billion-dollar side effect disclaimers.",

      "A new range of Bluetooth\u00ae and cabled earphones that reveal a magical new world of sound quality.",
      "This campaign is a world first. We are going to change the way people listen to sound and allow everyone to go on a magical, transformative journey. With our new technology you will experience your favourite music like you have never heard it before.",
      "From the moment that humans were able to start communicating using sound, there has been a desire to listen. In fact, some of the earliest listening spaces date from as long ago as 80 BC. People would gather to listen in areas such as caves or amphitheatres that were built specifically to help us hear more clearly. Voices and musical instruments helped people to express emotion, tell stories and share experiences.",
      "As the world has advanced, the desire to hear more detail remains. There has been incredible progress visually, with retina screens and high-definition televisions, but our ability to hear higher levels of detail has not progressed at the same rate.  Modern technology is used to retrospectively \u2018correct\u2019 sound electronically in order to try to improve the experience.",
      "But what if we could work with our ears to hear more detail than ever before\u2026?",
      "Welcome to the world of Mirror Image Sound\u2122",
      "We are never going to hear mirror image sound naturally due to the irregular bends and shapes inside our ears. As sound enters our ears the chaotic reflections damage our ability to hear detail. Everyone\u2019s ears are different which means that we all have different levels of ear distortion. We\u2019ll never hear the same piece of music in the same way as each other.",
      "But the one thing we all have in common is that our ears distort around 20% of everything we hear.",
      "THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WHEN WE HEAR SOUND. SEE HOW SOUND BOUNCES OFF THE DIFFERENT BENDS AND CURVES IN OUR EARS.",
      "Traditional earphones and headphones make the reflected sound distortion problem worse by adding even more chaotic sound reflections due to how sound reflects inside their designs. Because of this, it doesn\u2019t matter how much money you spend on traditional sound equipment - you will never experience mirror image sound.",
      "THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WHEN WE HEAR SOUND THROUGH A TRADITIONAL IN-EAR EARPHONE. SEE HOW SOUND BOUNCES AROUND THE EARPHONE ENCLOSURE AND THE BENDS AND CURVES IN OUR EARS.",
      "The patent-pending technology we have developed allows us all to hear mirror image sound for the first time. Our unique design works by treating sound like light - very similar to the way a periscope reflects light. Our technology allows us to bypass the irregular bends and shapes in our ears so that we can deliver mirror image sound directly.",
      "THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WHEN WE HEAR SOUND THROUGH THE NEW FLARE EARS WITH MIRROR IMAGE SOUND\u2122 TECHNOLOGY. SEE HOW SOUND IS PRECISELY REFLECTED IN THE EARPHONE AND THROUGH OUR EARS.",
      "PATENTS",
      "UK 2114682.4,  PCT/GB2022/052504, TAIWAN 111132969",
      "We created a scaled-up prototype in order to visualise how light reflects inside, and travels precisely through, Mirror Image Sound technology.",
      "The law of reflection for sound is the same as light, i.e. the angle of incidence of a sound wave equals the angle of reflection, which means that a mirror image of light, equals a mirror image reflection of sound.",
      "Last year we produced a proof of concept, the E-Prototype showcasing our new technology. This enabled people to hear mirror image sound for the first time. The response has been overwhelming and the reviews speak for themselves so we started work on designing a range of affordable earphones that everyone could enjoy.",
      "Visit the Flare website to check out E-Prototype.",
      "We strongly believe that mirror image sound should be accessible to everyone. This campaign will allow us to manufacture a range of new earphones at different price points in the UK that will all produce mirror image sound.",
      "In order to do this we need to invest in expensive tooling so that we can produce the earphones at an affordable price. We need your help as backers to bring this campaign to life.",
      "In the studio, artists, producers and engineers are able to solo instruments in tracks in order to hear precise information of how they each sound. They have to do this, as once combined, it becomes impossible to hear every detail of each instrument. The Mirror Image Sound experience allows everyone to hear every tiny detail. You can play tracks dozens of times and each time focus on a different element.",
      "Music",
      "The listening experience of Mirror Image Sound technology is like no other. Tracks that would previously sound cluttered or over-complex, now burst into life with beautiful levels of detail. Older recordings with very little correction sound as though you are listening in the studio, with the artists as they perform. Complex classical recordings allow you to hear the individual layers of instruments -an incredible thing to experience. It\u2019s as though you are sitting amongst the orchestra.",
      "There are no \u2018best music genres\u2019 with Mirror Image Sound technology. All music sounds the best you have ever heard it. You will go on a transformative journey listening to new and old favourites.",
      "Binaural Listening",
      "Binaural recordings are created using an artificial head that mimics our natural ears, this allows recordings to be made that imitate the real experience. However, this real experience includes the 20% distortion added from the shape inside our ears. The extra issue with these types of recordings is that when you listen to them your ears are adding a second distortion. When you listen with an EARS earphone you are removing this second distortion and binaural recordings explode with even more realism making any VR experience truly mind blowing.",
      "Gaming",
      "The drastically increased levels of detail with Mirror Image Sound\u2122 technology enable you to gain an advantage over your opponent in gaming. Hearing all the subtleties in sound means you can react faster than people using standard earphones or headphones.",
      "Your Favourite Movie",
      "Movies have never sounded or felt like this, with so much detail and depth you will find it hard to watch a film without wearing your EARS earphones. Drama is intensified, the thrills feel real. Immersive and all-consuming.",
      "Unparalleled Noise Cancellation",
      "Due to the removal of natural ear resonances which amplify external sounds by as much as 21dB, external noise cancellation is maximised without the need for electronics that damage the listening experience.",
      "A Perfect Fit",
      "Because Mirror Image Sound technology is working with your ears to replace the natural chaotic reflections with perfectly angled ones, it means that the earphones fit very comfortably in every ear. Three sizes of memory foam and three sizes of silicone tips ensure that you also get that perfect seal.",
      "A Safer Sound",
      "With so much more detail to experience, less volume is needed, making EARS safer for your ears.",
      "We want you to feel great wearing our earphones. We\u2019ve made a range of easy to switch bumpers, wraps and headbands so that you\u2019re able to fully customise your own look.",
      "Your EARS styled your way.",
      "You can customise any of the EARS earphones with a range of exciting, user-replaceable accessories: Bumpers and Wraps are available in 9 colour rainbow packs as add-on perks.",
      "Pull up to the bumpers",
      "The user-replaceable bumpers are very easy to switch and press into place. A pair of bumpers are included with each EARS earphone (in the same core colour) but there is also the option to buy a range of interchangeable bumpers in a rainbow pack variety of 9 colours.",
      "Wrappers delight",
      "The wraps are also available as an add-on perk in the same 9 colours. They are easily pressed onto the earphones to form a solid colour wrap so that you can fully colour co-ordinate your look.",
      "The A R and S models all include a Bluetooth\u00ae option with the following spec:",
      "The E series comes with a fixed 3.5mm jack cable with a microphone.",
      "The A model comes with a Bluetooth\u00ae cable with detachable MMCX connectors.",

      "\"I hear incredibly clearly, amazing bottom-end response and lots of detail, lots of presence and I couldn't ask for anything more from them, and that\u2019s the only real reason why I'd buy any set of headphones is because they sound amazingly good.\"",
      "Gary Langan | Art of Noise, Founder of Metropolis Studios",
      "\"One of the things that I really do enjoy doing with my E-prototypes is listening to how other people have made their records, contemporaries of mine. They give me the ability to go back and put my elbows on the console as if I was making the record with them.",
      "With the E- prototypes I can climb inside and explore and experience how they put that record together and there's a space, there's a clarity, there\u2019s a calmness that you get. It doesn't matter what you're listening to - these take you to somewhere where the listeners should really be able to go.\"",
      "Isy Suttie | Comedian, actress, writer",
      "\"They enhance my listening experience of music. I absolutely love these headphones. They make you feel like you're at a gig. That's the only way to explain it. So you can be washing up or walking along the street and your feel like you're in Brixton Academy. Right in the middle of the music and it is transformative. I don\u2019t know how they do it.

      "\"They just seemed to be extraordinarily balanced between the bottom end and the mid and the top end everything was very, very clear. In working on mixing reggae you use a lot of spin delay echoes and in mixing with the e-prototype I could hear the trail of the echo even longer than I could when I was listening on the speakers which just showed how much more I was hearing - I was experiencing.\"",

      "\"...These days, upgrades in high-end kit tend to give incremental gains, but the E-Prototype feels like a real leap forward. The detail is mind-boggling. You can hear everything with total clarity, each instrument occupying its own space no matter how complex the track...\"",
      "\"...The E-Prototypes just relished the chance to show their musical muscle \u2013 and did so admirably. I could hear everything pin-sharp, with excellent soundstage and no distortion. It was as if everything was lighter; not heavyweight and slow. If this was a car it would be a Tesla Model 3; very fast acceleration and nimble...\"",
      "\"...The new E-Prototype model by Flare Audio in Sussex sounds astonishing. They are one of the occasional audio products that make you want to re-listen to all the music you know...\"",
      "When Flare was established in 2010 we were a small team of 2. Since then we have grown as both a team and a brand. We\u2019re now a team of 17 and have developed products ranging from earphones to loudspeakers - ear protectors to calming in-ear devices.",
      "We have a large amount customers around the world as well having over 2.7 million followers on Facebook, 90k on Instagram and 75k on Twitter. We ship our products to over 186 countries including our life-changing product Calmer\u00ae - a passive in-ear device that helped us to form the new EARS earphone range.",
      "Flare is an established company selling unique and life-changing products.",
      "Products like Calmer are changing the lives of people by reducing the stress loading from sounds and noises that can cause irritation and anxiety. Calmer reduces ear distortions from everyday sounds which have had a huge impact on peoples day to day lives. The success of Calmer\u2019s unique technology directly led to the technology used in EARS.",

      "Davies \u2013 Co-Founder | Flare Audio",
      "Before founding Flare in 2010 Davies was a retained firefighter at Shoreham by Sea Fire Service, serving 13 years with the last 5 years as a crew commander. It was during this time that a series of fortuitous events led him to spending some time as a touring sound engineer, harking back to his roots of DJ-ing which in turn steered him to having a huge change in career and starting his own PA hire company.",
      "It wasn\u2019t long before he was bitten by the audio bug and started \u2018re-designing the loudspeaker\u2019 - believing that great audio means a better connection between the artist and audience. These speakers were used at concerts, festivals, gigs and installs including stages at Bestival, the Coca Cola campaign for the London 2012 Olympics and Dolby Atmos speakers for Selfridges new cinema.",
      "It was in 2016 that Davies decided to try and miniaturise the loudspeaker technology into a consumer earphone. This was the beginning of Flare's journey into consumer audio products.",
      "Naomi - Co-Founder | Flare Audio",
      "Naomi's career started as a secondary school art teacher and special educational needs teacher. It was when she took a shift in career as a Youth Officer for the district Council putting on under-18 band nights that she was hit by the desire to work more fully in the music industry. Working for some time as a graphic designer for musicians and bands Naomi soon joined Davies in founding Flare, combining their knowledge and passion for music, audio and creativity.",
      "By throwing out the rule book and thinking differently we have unlocked sound technology that we believe is going to change how the world listens. Flare is just a small team of 17 people based in Lancing, West Sussex, UK, yet we aim to become a recognised global sound innovator thanks to our core value of channelling highly logical, simple and effective technology.",
      "We\u2019ve spent the last 13 years dedicated to the research and development of advancing sound quality and the last 18 months developing the EARS range featured in this campaign. We want to make our exciting new range of earphones local to us here in the UK in an efficient and scalable way. We have partnered with one of the UK\u2019s most advanced manufacturing companies to help us bring our new earphone range to life and at scale.",
      "Hundreds of prototypes have been produced over the last year to develop our technology and to perfect our sound and shape. Starting with Calmer, we have taken everything we have learned, through to E-Prototype and now to the EARS range. Fine-tuning every angle with pinpoint accuracy.",
      "We\u2019ve set up a large logistics hub at Flare HQ to prepare for high levels of orders so that as the volumes scale we are able to cope with increasing levels of demand and we have partnered with a global logistics firm to ship our earphones worldwide.",
      "For the last six years we have been shipping our products to over 186 countries.",
      "As soon as we reach our campaign goal the manufacturing timeline will commence. This process begins with the creation of prototype tooling that will allow us to perfect the earphone design and build before we commence the expensive production tooling. We expect this first process to take 6-8 weeks.",
      "Once the prototype tooling stage is complete, work will commence on the complex production tooling phase. The intricate internal design that creates Mirror Image Sound technology means that we require a highly precise tool to make it. We are expecting this phase to last 12-14 weeks.",
      "The next phase is ultrasonic tooling. The internal design requires advanced ultrasonic welding of two main components in order to marry the two complex internal shapes together that Mirror Image Sound technology requires. The end result is a design that is one solid part without the use of any glue. We are expecting this stage to take 6-8 weeks.",
      "The solid titanium and aluminium driver housings, Bluetooth\u00ae, drivers, cable assemblies and other accessories will all commence production and are scheduled to take 6-8 weeks in parallel to the ultrasonic tooling.",
      "Trial assembly runs is the next phase which we expect to take 1-2 weeks. This involves the creation of an SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) so that teams of people can assemble each earphone in exactly the same way.",
      "Once all the above stages are complete the production runs will commence which are expected to take 4-6 weeks.",
      "It\u2019s at that point that the earphones will start to be shipped to our backers across the world.",

      "Bite Into Comfort: The Pierogi Bucket - Ohio City's New Comfort Food Favorite",
      "My name is Miroslav, and I've worked in the service industry for over 20 years - from hotels like Marriott and Hilton to both fast food and upscale restaurants. For the past two and a half years I've been with Perla Pierogies, where I created and developed the Pierogi Bucket concept. Originally from Eastern Europe, I've always been passionate about culinary traditions and sharing comforting, authentic flavors in new and acceptable ways.",
      "This campaign is important to me because The Pierogi Bucket is a way to share a food tradition I love in a playful, modern format. It's more than just a food project - it's a reflection of my background and a chance to grow something meaningful from the ground up.",
      "The Pierogi Bucket is a fresh, fast, and fun take on comfort food - served in a bucket and packed with flavor. With your support, we can launch as a ghost kitchen or pop-up in Ohio City, build awareness, and lay the groundwork for a permanent location. Your contribution will help turn a proven idea into a local favorite.",
      "We're seeking $30,000 to cover early startup costs of launching The Pierogi Bucket in Ohio City. This includes: renting space in commercial kitchen or partnering with a restaurant for pop-up hours, food prep, supplies, packaging, marketing, and basic equipment.",
      "Perks for backers: a custom Pierogi Bucket sticker to say thank you, voucher (s) redeemable for food once we launch, a signed copy of my \"PIEROGI!\" book at select contribution levels.",
      "Even if we don't reach the full goal, partial funding will still help us bring The Pierogi Bucket to Ohio City through pop-ups. This concept is already being served and loved at Perla Pierogies in Parma - now it's time to introduce it to a wider audience and prepare for a dedicated location in Ohio City.",
      "This isn't just another takeout concept - it's a way to bring regional comfort food to more people in a fun, convenient format. At the heart of The Pierogi Bucket is a simple idea: fried Perla Minis, served in a playful bucket with kielbasa. It's fast, satisfying, and easy to enjoy. Handmade pierogi and select sides will be available, but the core of the concept is the bucket - familiar, sharable, and built for simplicity.",
      "What makes this campaign different is that The Pierogi Bucket isn't just an idea - it already has a proven track record. We've been running a small version of the concept at Perla Pierogies in Parma, where it well received by customers and performs especially well on delivery platforms.",
      "By supporting this campaign, you're not just backing a concept - you're helping bring a working, well-received food idea into a new neighborhood where it can grow. That makes a real difference, and you'll be part of the story form the beginning",
      "Like any new venture, there are uncertainties - such as finding the right kitchen partner, balancing early production costs, and getting the word our in a new neighborhood. But I've spent over two decades in the service industry and two and a half years with Perla Pierogies, where I developed and refined this concept. I understand how to run lean, stay flexible, and deliver consistently good food.",
      "Our plan is to start with low-overhead pop-ups in available restaurant kitchens - this gives a chance to build interest, adjust based on feedback, and grow organically. We're not rushing into a permanent lease until we know we're ready.",
      "Even if you can't contribute financially, you can still support us by: sharing this campaign with friends and local food fans, following us on social media and help build awareness, using Indiegogo's share tools to spread the word and encourage others to join in. Every bit of support helps us get closer to making The Pierogi Bucket a reality in Ohio City!",

It uses a washable fiber filter with the patented \"shower spray\" technology, which also ensures consistent evaporative humidity levels regardless of the water level in the tank. Airdog MOI also has an active electrolyte module. It effectively inactivates 99.99% of mold and bacteria and eliminates possible odor issues. With MOI delivering clean and comfortable air in your space, its washable filters and our latest technological innovations provide a new, unbeatable performance to the humidifier category.",

With Airdog MOI, you don\u2019t need to worry about any of that. Airdog MOI is equipped with an active electrolyte module. It will activate our proprietary electrolyte disinfection for five minutes every hour to inactivate bacteria growth and prevent odor, delivering clean and healthy air right to you.",
      "2. Most humidifiers use ultrasonic technology, creating localized humidity and raising potential bacteria and mold issues. Airdog MOI is the perfect answer to these problems with cold evaporative technology. With this technology, water will naturally evaporate in the air, and moisture evaporation is enhanced through circulating fans and spread into the air. Thus, MOI ensures constant humidity output across the room without any of the mist or hassle.",
      "3. Most humidifiers need to constantly replace filters, which can easily cost hundreds of dollars annually. Airdog\u2019s reusable design saves more than money, but also our environment. MOI is designed with sustainability and usability in mind. With the washable design, you can wash the filter whenever there is a stain on it to keep it clean and mold-free, keeping your environment safe and healthy.",
      "4.MOI will automatically run the drying mode when there is no water detected in the chamber. This mode utilizes the fans internally and acts as a blow dryer to dry out any residual water left inside the water tank, filters and any other areas inside the chamber. This eliminates any and all possibility of potential mold growth.",

      "The 240W GaN charger is the new addition to SlimQ GaN mini charger series, from 30W to 240W",
      "If you own a high-power laptop for gaming/design/engineering, you are probably fed up with how much room the big charger is taking up in your backpack, not to mention its weight. You can now get more free space and carry less weight with SlimQ F240 and enjoy gaming anywhere and working wherever with a stylish, portable, powerful charger.",
      "The SlimQ F240 Charger is the world\u2019s first 240W Gallium Nitride (GaN) charger. It\u2019s also by far the smallest, despite having two built-in Type-C ports. It weighs just 400g so you can take it with you wherever you go.",
      "Leave your bulky, brick-like charger behind. The future is the SlimQ F240, the only charger you\u2019ll need for ALL your devices.",
      "iPhone 12 Mini size SlimQ F240 Charger is the world\u2019s first 240W Gallium Nitride (GaN) charger, and also the smallest, even with two Type-C ports. Now you can forget about chunky chargers that take space in your backpack. With SlimQ F240 you can enjoy gaming and work with desired portability.",
      "Through the DC port, this charger can comfortably output 240W power capacity. That covers the power needs for virtually all laptop models on the market, including those models that are renowned for high power consumption.",
      "Power is shared intelligently on a laptop-first principle to 1xDC and 2xUSB-C. If you are a serious gamer, engineer, or designer, SlimQ 240W is the best charger you can find. Period.",
      "SlimQ F240 packs the power to charge big laptops such as Dell Alienware or MSI, AT THE SAME TIME as your iPad, iPhone, or any other mobile device.",
      "Stop worrying about having enough available sockets to charge all your devices when you\u2019re on the go. SlimQ F240 has you covered. It supports:",
      "\u2022 PD 3.0\n\u2022 PPS\n\u2022 QC4+\n\u2022 AFC\n\u2022 SCP \n\u2022 FCP",
      "All for quick charging of Apple, Samsung, and Huawei devices as well as most smartphones.",
      "SlimQ F240 is the best solution for gamers, engineers, or designers that want to be mobile. With only 400g in weight, you can easily bring it with you wherever you go.",
      "High power consumption laptops (more than 100W) normally use round barrel DC connectors, some at various dimensions. SlimQ F240 comes with a DC-DC cable (5.5x2.5) that covers about 60% of laptop models on the market. For models that don\u2019t use the 5.5x2.5 connector, we\u2019ve made converters, so virtually all laptop models are compatible.",
      "* The extender may be purchased separately.",
      "Don\u2019t go hogging all that power! The new SlimQ charger has plenty of power to share. That\u2019s why we designed a multiport extender to allow extra connectivity. With an additional 2xUSB A and 2xUSB C, you can share the power with friends or charge literally all your mobile devices at once. This extender can also be used with your legacy adapter and turn it into a PD-enabled modern charger and fast charge your phones and USB C laptops.",
      "Thermal management is vital when it comes to making a performance charger function well and last longer. The best heat dissipation mechanism is the infusion of thermal conductive silicone materials. Not only will it conduct heat quickly, but it will also stabilize and protect internal components from erosion, helping them last longer. We use high-quality thermal conductive silicon materials in SlimQ F240 and other high-capacity SlimQ chargers, even though it costs more in material and manufacturing. Because we never compromise on quality. This way SlimQ chargers can continue to work effectively, at full capacity, and for many hours. \n\nMany other chargers can\u2019t deal with the excess heat the chargers generate. Oftentimes, those chargers will have to reduce their output capacity after a short period of usage (often less than an hour) when the heat gets too much.  This under-power condition will cause high-performance computers to underperform. The F240 does not have this problem.",
      "This is a charger you can use all over the world.",
      "You might not know that all countries have safety requirements for chargers. Many specifically require chargers to have a high enough PF (Power Factor) value. The reason is that a charger/adapter with a low PF value will cause extra load on a local power grid. Power companies sometimes charge commercial customers more for using low PF electronics on their network. A charger that fails to meet local PF requirements should not be legally sold or used in many countries. \n\nThis isn\u2019t something you need to worry about with SlimQ F240. It has a built-in PFC (Power Factory Correction) circuit and components to make sure the charger has a high enough PF value to be legal to use in any country in the world.",
      "We are using four top-notch GaN chips from Navitas and Transphorm, who are the leaders in developing new generation GaN chips. \n\nThese chips perform up to 20x faster than old, slow silicon (Si) chips, delivering up to 3x more power conversion. Their amazing tech enables SlimQ F240 to be built with such a compact design and still provide high power capacity.",
      "Play your computer video games, create your 3D renders or work on your engineering project with total safety. Even with the most power-demanding computing tasks, the SlimQ 240W charger will NEVER HEAT UP and ALWAYS provide multi-layer total protection.",
      "Here at SlimQ, we celebrate practicality and convenience because we know that\u2019s what users who are often on the go want and need. Our goal is to create iconic and functional products that truly provide solutions. The new SlimQ 240W charger is designed to look good with a superior feeling and grip.",
      "We\u2019ve been able to establish a beta program thanks to our great community of backers. Since January 2021, we have been having many people testing the F240 on many devices in real-life situations. The feedback? Overwhelmingly positive. Plus we got valuable suggestions as well. Thanks to all our beta testers for helping us test SlimQ F240 on all these devices:",
      "iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone XS Max, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 12 Pro, Galaxy S10, Galaxy Note 10+, Samsung S20, Galaxy Note 20 +, OnePlus 7T, OnePlus 8T, iPad Mini, iPad Pro, iPad Pro 11 2018, Eluktronics RP-15, MacBook Pro 13, Macbook Pro 16, Microsoft Surface, Microsoft Surface Pro 4, Razer Blade 15 and Dell Precision 15, Lenovo Laptop, Two Dell D7400 at the same time, Dell D7900, ...",
      "I love the feel and grip of the charger. It feels very sturdy. A perfect scenario for this charger (with USB-C port) is that I will only need to bring this charger along when I am traveling (once this Covid nightmare is over), and I will be able to use it to charge my power bank and Nintendo Switch and my partner's phone instead of carrying multiple chargers. The charger doesn't feel hot at all. I like the LED indicator to show that it is working.",
      "I was able to solder a Razer Blade connector to be used with the F240 cable and it worked on my Razer Blade 15. My Razer Blade runs on a 230W adapter. The charger does not feel hot at all during the whole process, good job there. I also run some 3D software to stress the laptop a little while charging with F240, the charger behaved as expected, not hot. My Razer Blade has a 1070 video card, which is not exactly the most power consuming but it appears the F240 charger can handle more load without a problem. Compare with the original adapter which is also good looking, the F240 has two more USB C ports which are convenient. I suggested the SlimQ team add a USB C to USB-A converter so some small devices can also be charged. Overall, I am happy with this F240 charger and I am just hoping the team can source a Razer Blade connector so they can officially have a converter for my laptop.",
      "You can buy add-ons after you choose the perk. If you want to buy more add-ons such as cables, converters and more F-Series chargers, you can use following perk. We will ship all your orders together, so make sure you have the correct address on all your orders.",

      "During an accident, seatbelt buckles may become stuck or inaccessible. In critical moments, trust the Surevival Pen to swiftly get you out of harm's way.",
      "Retract the tip, and it becomes a flat thumb rest for striking the sharp tungsten carbide tip with maximum power.",
      "All existing pens either have small thumb rest areas that limit striking power and risk thumb injuries, or require switching caps between writing and striking modes. The Surevival Pen's telescoping tip eliminates these drawbacks.",

During an accident, a car may lose all electrical power, doors get jammed, and seatbelt buckles are stuck or inaccessible. When a car falls into the water, mere seconds can make the difference between life and tragedy.",
      "Extensive study by AAA (American Automotive Association) published in 2019 confirmed that emergency vehicle escape and rescue tools are a lifesaver.",
      "In September 2017 on the way home from work I witnessed an accident on the other side of the road. A car turned sideways and slammed into a tree.  People immediately ran to help but the two teenage boy occupants were unconscious and the car doors were locked. It took a few minutes for the firetruck to arrive, but it felt like an eternity.",

      "DEVELOPMENT",
      "In 2020, we launched the WYN Bullet - a compact emergency window breaker in the shape of a bullet - which turned out to be a huge success. As many backers expressed the need for a seatbelt cutter, we were limited by the extreme compactness of the WYN Bullet. However, the idea lingered in our minds, leading us to embark on a three-year journey of design, development, prototyping, testing, and refinement. Today, we're proud to introduce our latest creation, the culmination of our labor of love: The Surevival Pen",
      "TEAM",
      "WYN LABS\u2122 is a product development team based in the beautiful Pacific Northwest. We are passionate about developing products that make your life a little easier and safer everyday.",
      "FAQ's:",
      "Why do I need this?  In a world where unforeseen emergencies can strike at any moment, the Surevival Pen isn't just a writing instrument; it's an essential tool for personal safety. With a concealed seatbelt cutter and a powerful window breaker, this pen is engineered for those critical moments when swift action can make the difference between life and tragedy.  Don't leave your safety to chance; equip yourself with the Surevival Pen.",
      "What makes Surevival Pen superior to other tactical pens? First, it is the only tactical pen with a built-in seatbelt cutter under the pen clip. Second, other pens either have small thumb rest areas that limit striking power and risk thumb injuries, or require switching caps between writing and striking modes. The Surevival Pen's telescoping tip eliminates these drawbacks.",
      "Is it easy to use the seatbelt cutter?  Yes, our seatbelt cutter is designed for quick and easy use even with just one hand.  Simply slide the seatbelt under the clip at about 45-degree angle, then pull the pen to swiftly cut through.",
      "Is it safe to carry the Surevival Pen in your pocket?  Yes.  The blade cover has a detent which requires some force to release.  If you accidentally pull hard on the pen while it\u2019s in your pocket, it will cut the pocket.",
      "Can I reset the blade cover after use?  Yes.  Just push the blade cover back in place past the detent.",
      "What is the material of the window breaker tip?  It is made of Tungsten Carbide, which is extremely hard.  Only diamond is harder than Tungsten Carbide.",
      "Is the tip safe to touch?  Yes.  The tungsten carbide tip is not sharp to cut the skin even if pressed against your finger.",
      "What ink refill does Surevival Pen have?  It has a black medium ballpoint ink cartridge. Surevival Pen works with a wide variety of Parker-type G2 cartridges from many different popular brands like Fisher Space, Parker, Schmidt\u2026",
      "We have successfully launched and fulfilled eight Kickstarter projects. We learned a lot from our past manufacturing and fulfillment processes. There are always risks and unexpected issues in launching a new product. The factory already made a lot of samples for us. All the tooling is finished and production will begin once the campaign ends. We will post regular project updates to keep you informed of our progress.",

      "About 40 percent of children with food allergies are allergic to more than one food.",
      "After years spent in professional kitchens, we learned one thing; Americans are Allergic As Fudge. As we developed the Proper recipe, we noticed interesting things about what was already on the market. A LOT of the cookie doughs were only Bakeable or just edible, maybe Vegan but not Corn Free. And from our own experiences (with family members having food allergies), we knew that if you have one food allergy, you could have several more. It didn't make sense that with so many cookie options, there wasn't one that everyone could eat.",
      "The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement were founded in part to target practices that threaten climate stability and ecosystem resilience. Both groups have determined that we require an agricultural revolution that is based in sustainable practices and implementation of system wide innovation.",
      "Proper was created to have an impact on that food system and consumer's relationship with plant-based foods, specifically desserts. Our efforts will need a Kickstart of $10,000 to produce a sustainable recipe that's hard to compete with. WE DO NOT USE ALMONDS IN OUR DOUGH.",
      "The funds will help support our R&D and Commercialization efforts. We want to scale down our recipe and take out ingredients that may be adding too much sugar and sodium to it\u2019s makeup. (see our current ingredient list below)",
      "Our biggest goal with a recipe development lab is to add at least 3g of Fiber and 3g of Protein without affecting the taste that won over our earliest customers.",
      "Funds will also be used for a logistics consultant to ensure that every order of cookie dough is delivered ice cold to your doorstep, at the lowest cost possible. This'll allow us to offer Nationwide shipping at affordable pricing and aid in our efforts to make Allergen-Free dough accessible for everyone.",
      "There are always risks: miscalculation of costs, production waste, logistics etc. But we are taking measures to minimize these risks. We have a team of individuals helping us source some of the best consultants in logistics, nutrition, and commercialization. We promise to be transparent throughout the campaign to deliver a cookie you'll be satisfied with.",

    "allParagraphs": [
      "Award-winning device, extending all your portable electronics' battery lifespan by as much as 50%.",
      "And fast-charging and overnight charging also shorten battery lifespan.",
      "A battery that is charged to 100% is under high chemical stress, which increases battery wear. Fast charging not only accelerates this wear but also raises the battery's temperature, which is even more harmful to its long-term lifespan. And with overnight charging these batteries stay under high chemical stress for hours\u2026 Besides, why would you want to charge fast if you have 7 or more hours to charge your battery overnight?",
      "Lithium-ion batteries power our world, but their gradual wear forces us to replace our 'old' devices more frequently. Shockingly, a quarter of all devices end up in the trash simply because their batteries have worn out. This not only hurts our wallet, but also leads to mountains (literally) of e-waste, which is a significant environmental concern. On top of this, dealing with batteries dying on us throughout the day becomes a recurring inconvenience.",
      "Plugged between your charger and device, Leo first analyzes your battery and then automatically sets an optimal charge limit, regulates charging speeds, and schedules timely breaks to keep your batteries healthy for years.",
      "(see FAQ for sources and more information)",
      "It is this combination of features that makes Leo so effective in improving the lifespan of your batteries:",
      "Leo automatically sets an optimal charge limit at approximately 90% for all your USB devices. Maintaining your batteries within the range of 10% to 90% can already significantly extend their lifespan.",
      "(While Samsung phones include this feature by default, it's a rarity among smart devices and nearly nonexistent among non-smart ones. To see how Leo's capabilities stack up against other devices, refer to the comparison lower on this page.)",
      "Leo charges at a slower, more sustainable rate when you have the time, such as during the night. However, with a simple push of a button, you can switch to fast charging when needed!",
      "During night charging, Leo takes a break at around 80%, effectively reducing the duration your batteries remain at a high charge percentage and voltage.",
      "(iPhones use the same trick at night, but they do not offer a charge limit and will still charge to 100% eventually)",
      "Leo works just by plugging it in between your device and your charger: Plug&Play. You do not have to do anything yourself. Even one of our team members' grandmothers is using a prototype of Leo, and she just turned 87!",
      "Leo can be used to optimize charging for practically all your USB-C devices. Whether your device uses a USB-C to lightning cable or a USB-A to USB-C cable, they can still benefit from Leo. Its adaptability enables implementation on both the charger side and the device side.",
      "As mentioned earlier, you can still opt for a fast charge up to 100% when necessary. Simply hold the button to swiftly override Leo and switch to fast charging. This way, there's no need to unplug Leo.",
      "Leo is designed with sustainability in mind. Our device is built to last for many years, and with updatable software, it will stay up to date throughout its lifespan. We've made the cable modular and easily replaceable to ensure longevity, as we understand that even the best cables can wear out over time.",
      "You don\u2019t need an app or anything to make Leo work: just plug it in. But if you like extra features: here we go. With the Leo App, you get a dashboard with battery analytics, you can measure battery health, see charging graphs, and keep Leo up to date with OTA firmware updates! We will continue adding new features through the app and Leo.",
      "How? Let\u2019s say you own 3 rechargeable portable electronic devices:",
      "Average smartphone: ~$823\n3 other devices (headphones, smart watch, tablet, mouse, keyboard, speakers, go-pro, etc): ~$450\nTotal: ~$1273\n\nIf you would be able to improve the lifespan of these devices by just 5% (representing a value of ~$64) Leo would already earn back its value, as Leo is priced at ~$59 on Kickstarter. The expected improved lifespan actually reaches as much as 50%, which would mean a 10x return on investment within the current lifecycle of your devices.",
      "Lab results actually show as much as a 63% lifespan increase, but as we aspire to underpromise and overdeliver we assume a lifespan increase of as much as 50%.",
      "After a year of continuously cycling dozens of batteries using different protocols of Leo, our results were unanimous. Across all the protocols we examined, we consistently observed a substantial extension in battery lifespan, reaching up to an impressive 63%. The actual degree of battery life extension largely depends on the user's existing efforts to mitigate battery degradation.",
      "The experiments were done with AccuBattery installed, in order to externally validate our findings. With over 10 million downloads, this trusted battery analytics app showcases an example of the tangible impact of Leo on battery longevity.",
      "To learn more about the science behind Leo and optimal battery charging, go to our FAQ page.",
      "Our journey began approximately 3 years ago as part of an MS Physics literature study on battery degradation mechanisms. We then started running the first tests.",
      "In the renowned Demonstrator Lab at the Vrije University in Amsterdam, we converted our ideas into an actual first prototype. With this prototype, we started testing the effectiveness of our protocols both in the lab (see our technical validation section), as well as testing with our first beta testers.",
      "Next step: implement all of our learnings and beta tester feedback. Brainstorming, sketching, 3D printing, and testing everything we could think of.",
      "New European laws (2022): Transition to the universal USB Type-C connector and protocol.",

A single blade is more effective and sharper than any of the newer 3- or 5-blade shaving systems today! But we took it to another level and redefined tradition, making the Perfect Shave:",
      "You've never seen a razor quite like this before. HypeBody has reimagined the vintage safety razor and rebuilt it from the ground up.",
      "We're not just talking about shaving with a single-blade razor \u2014 we\u2019re talking about a precision-engineered, ergonomic shaving device made of premium aerospace-grade aluminum. A superior shaving experience that guarantees your skin will be smooth as silk and irritation-free every time.",
      "In 1940, Ferrari revolutionized the world of transportation \u2014 turning something utilitarian and mass-produced into a luxurious one-of-a-kind experience. The low vibrations of the V12 engine. The soft feel of the steering wheel\u2019s supple leather.",

      "Its precision-milled aerospace-grade aluminum capable of standing Ferrari\u2019s g-force turns\u2026 its magnetic quick-switch shave settings, reminiscent of the precision paddle-shift gearbox\u2026 all come together for the ultimate shaving experience.",
      "You can settle for good enough, or invest in something engineered to be perfect. The blade is set flush on your skin leaving you with exactly what you want \u2014 a shave that\u2019s as Smooth as Silk.",
      "It takes time, it\u2019s a craft, but this is the only Razor that\u2019ll be worth your time.",
      "The HypeBody is made to protect you from ingrown hairs, irritation, and discomfort. While other three or four-bladed razors suffer from bulk building up between blades as they're dragged across your face (taking layers of skin with it), our single edge provides a barber\u2019s precision shave, gliding across your skin without dragging and pulling hair.",
      "\"Cartridges take off extra skin that can cause a lot of irritation for guys with sensitive skin. The safety razor takes off the exact amount you need.\" - Chris Ramos, barber at Baxter Finley Barber & Shop in L.A.\n \u201cAnd come winter, you'll need those extra layers to protect you when frosty winds are licking the moisture off your face.\u201d - Esquire",

Get your injector blades from us as add-ons during the campaign, after the campaign ends on our website, or from any other brand \u2014 our intuitive blade magazine doesn\u2019t limit you. It\u2019s that simple!",
      "Our razors are designed to function with any standard available blade magazine on the market, this includes Schick injector blade magazine, Personna injector blade magazine and others, so you can use Hypebody blade magazine getting it as an add-on or use any other brand blade magazine you have.",
      "Clogged blades are a thing of the past. HypeBody is made with a sleek and seamless design that allows for quick cleaning with the effortless removal of its heads. Easily clean through the areas between the body and razor, keeping it free from bacterial growth that is common with cartridge razors.",
      "Large corporate shaving companies can\u2019t negate the advantages of safety razors (as seen above in the media), though they highly caution their usage with safety concerns \u2014 which we\u2019ve tackled and laid to rest.",
      "Our intuitive product design allows all users to choose and select which head works best for their hair and skin, leaving you with complete control over the results of your shave. Something that cartridge razors cannot provide.",
      "With HypeBody\u2019s 3 settings \u2014 Sensitive, Comfort, and Ultra Close, you have more control than ever to adjust blade exposure (gap between the blade and the safety guard) to get the right shave your face needs.",
      "Hypebody is designed to allow you to customize your shave in an easy, intuitive and effective way with effortless head switching. Simply snap the head out with a simple push from the razor body and snap in the replacement head. No unnecessary screws that require additional steps to remove and install different heads.",
      "Cartridges are costly and subscriptions add up. Though single edge razors cost a bit more upfront, they end up costing you less in the long run because of the affordability of blades. Hypebody not only is intuitive, but will always give you the cleanest shave since you can continually switch to a sharper blade (as you would with cartridges) after a few uses with American Line blades only costing about 25-40 cents each!",
      "The difference?",
      "Single blade shaving can be daunting for beginners, but it doesn't have to be! Compared to other straight edge shavers, HypeBody brings a familiar touch with its lightweight feel, making for an easy transition.",
      "Unlike straight edge razors that take hours of practice \u2014 and lots of accidental cuts and nicks \u2014 to get right, the weight and feel of HypeBody sits just right in your hand. This makes the transition between cartridge razor and HypeBody a seamless experience.",
      "The moment you open your Hypebody package, it\u2019ll be clear that this is no ordinary razor. The ergonomic design of the razor not only provides sleek and unique aesthetics, but also allows for a firmer grip. The two-arm, aerospace-grade aluminum build separates itself from the competition by providing perfect control with a wide grip. This wide hold allows you to control the shaver with greater balance, avoiding unnecessary pressure near the head which may lead to cutting under the surface of the skin.",
      "It\u2019s all about the angles\u2026",
      "Many people have difficult first-time experiences with single edge razors due to their design and requirements. You need to hold it at the right angle, and keep consistent pressure throughout the shave\u2026 not with HypeBody!",
      "HypeBody tackles this with an innovative, patented design that helps you achieve a close shave without any razor burns or cuts. Simply place the front face of the razor against your skin and let it glide. The blade angle will be maintained at an optimum 30-degree angle, leading to a seamless transition and a smoother shave.",
      "Hypebody is made from premium aerospace-grade aluminum that provides a high strength to weight ratio, ductility and corrosion resistance.",
      "But to take it a step further, we\u2019ve strengthened the aluminum with an anodization process which adds a hard, wear-resistant layer that properly protects the underlying aluminum.",
      "The end result? A razor that is not only easy to handle and maneuver, but a premium razor with superior strength and amazing feel you can experience every day for years to come.",
      "Why the two variants?\n\nWe believe that a high-quality shave should be something that is accessible for everyone. This is why we\u2019ve specifically created HypeBody with two variations; making sure that users can experience the quality of a premium razor with options that cater to the needs of different users.\n\nMeet The Razors:",
      "The ME1 \u2014  The baseline model in the premium HypeBody line. The mechanical version offers both precision engineering and intuitive design which provide both professional quality shaves and an excellent experience.",
      "The beauty of the ME1 is its entire package. It has the light and balanced feel with its strong aerospace-grade aluminum body with the safety, precision, and usability built within its nylon shaving heads.",
      "The nylon head improves dimensional accuracy and fine detail for optimum functionality. What this means for you, is that the shave settings fit perfectly well with the aluminum razor body to offer you the perfect shave you need. The nylon head also has high impact strength, is crack resistant, highly abrasion resistant and has excellent chemical resistance to elements such as oils, greases, salts and water.",
      "You get all the precision and amazing benefits of our specially designed single blade razor at the most affordable price.",
      "The X1, the pinnacle standard of a premium single blade razor \u2014 the flagship version in our razor line. We call this the generational razor due to its attention to detail and build which will last for generations to come.",
      "Inspired by the sleek exterior and precise engineering of Italian Ferraris, the full aerospace-grade aluminum body and head make sure it feels just right in your hand. The X1 switches the aluminum shaving head with a premium magnetic option.",
      "Easily replace the blades and switch the shave settings thanks to the fine-tuned magnetic strength that provides the optimum hold between the shave setting and the razor body. The magnetic strength not only provides the perfect flexibility while loading a new blade but also allows the user to simply push out the shave setting and replace it with a desired shave setting head.",
      "When it comes to providing the best quality and experience, we did not hold back with the X1.",
