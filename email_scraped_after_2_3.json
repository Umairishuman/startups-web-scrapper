My first watch, the OUTCAST Field & Sea, was inspired by a 200-mile World Cup sled dog race in Eastern Siberia, where I won Bronze for the U.S.  I needed a way to time heats and track both countdown and elapsed time\u2014and the watch I was wearing only had an elapsed timer, so I built a watch with both. That watch was 400% funded last year, with zero returns. This is the same platform, same partners\u2014just a new dial with a new mission. (You can check out the original campaign by going here and scrolling down.)",
      "My newest creation\u2014 the Marksman Dial\u2014is built for a different kind of fieldwork, and aimed specifically at long distances hunters and competition shooters, by acting as a reference to adjust for crosswinds, and to convert between MILs and MOA, quickly.",
      "Like the Field & Sea watch, the Marksman watch is close to my heart.  I started shooting at five years old, and have harvested more than 40 bucks over the years, since then. I\u2019ve also owned a firearms company and designed and patented firearm components for several years, so this isn't venture into this space.",
      "That said, I\u2019ve already pre-paid for the custom parts, and they arrived and everything else is ready to go, since we are using the same case parts, movements, and supplier from the first campaign - your support will turn these dials and hands into fully assembled watches.",

It\u2019s a visual reference that saves time and prevents mistakes.",

It\u2019s for people who send rounds long distances, in wind, under pressure, and need to be on target. The Marksman Dial gives you critical non-caliber specific ballistic info where you can actually use it\u2014in the field, in the moment, without distraction.  Your support helps us finish production and keep this kind of gear going\u2014purpose-built, field-tested.",

The only new element is the 39mm case, which is made by the same company.  So we are confident we can execute and provide you with a watch worth more than you are paying for.",
      "We\u2019ve already prepaid for the dials and hands months ago, and they are now ready, and the remaining parts are sourced, and built 'on demand', so we can ship quickly, once funding is secured, without having to inventory the bulk of what we need to produce a watch.",

      "This is true, that to create something really great is extremely difficult. However, you need to start with something. Such a beginning for us was the first version of Bordo mini in 2015. It was a very simple, but at the same time, quite a good wallet, which many liked.",
      "We successfully delivered all the rewards and with new forces rushed into improvements and perfections. That way the second version was born. This project also became successful, but our product didn\u2019t receive great popularity. But I had anticipation ... A feeling, that it was just the beginning. This is not just \u201canother wallet\u201d. This is probably the best wallet in the world, it just needs to be improved a little more. And we got to work again...",
      "As a result, in 2017 a new wallet was born, which received great support. It was amazing! Honestly, we even stopped the advertising campaign after the first two weeks. Why? We were just afraid not to cope. In contrast to our past project, when we had only 130 backers, there were more than 100 in the new one only for the first day! But despite all the difficulties, we coped with this and delivered the best wallets to each of our backers. Then we organized sales through our website. Our business was going not bad :) But we can\u2019t live in peace. What do you think we did? We again started to improve and refine our favorite wallet.",
      "To tell the truth, the creation of this project was not very easy for us. In total, we spent almost a year on all the works. The tasks that we faced were more difficult than we thought, and some seemingly trivial things were very difficult to accomplish. What motivated us all this time? It's you! The person, who writes that can\u2019t wait for our wallet. The one, who says that his son has taken away his own wallet because it is so cool and he wants to order another one. All your feedback is a huge charge of motivation and energy for us.",
      "Where are our backers from!",
      "Bordo mini is a wallet that has many advantages! Let's find out about each of them in order :) Its size is the first thing that surprises people who see this miracle for the first time. It isn\u2019t bigger than a credit card. Only 7 cm x 9.5 cm \u2248 2.76 inch x 3.74 inch.",
      "You remember how pockets fully packed with different staff don\u2019t look nicely. With Bordo mini this won\u2019t be possible. With Bordo mini you can go both to the beach and to the official reception. And don\u2019t worry! You can always find a place to hide it.",
      "The size of Bordo mini allows you to place any world currency. If in doubt, don\u2019t worry, just email us and we will make a test video for you.",
      "Bordo mini is very convenient to use even in a half-open state. It makes it even easier and faster to interact with the wallet.",
      "It may seem to you that it isn\u2019t very convenient, but it is not true. You quickly get used to it and after a while, you even don\u2019t understand how it was before!",
      "Even when the Bordo mini is closed, you have quick access to any of your cards. This minimizes the time to search for a desired card.",
      "We should also pay attention to the spaciousness of the Bordo mini. At first glance it may seem that this baby doesn\u2019t place much, but you are mistaken: you can even carry 20 bills and 10 cards without problems.",
      "Therefore, both right-handed and left-handed versions are available. We think it is very unfair that most wallets are made only for right-handers.",
      "This wallet is the most functional. You have the choice between two additional slots: a card slot or a coin slot. Choose what you like more!",
      "And another nice bonus! Bordo mini can be used easily with one hand! It's so convenient!",
      "Bordo mini is developed in two designs, which differ not only in materials, but also in structural elements. Let's learn more about each of them.",
      "Leather design. The wallet is made of genuine high-quality Italian leather with a thickness of 1.4 - 1.6 mm. It is made in four calm colors: black, gray, brown, beige.

The tasks that we faced were more difficult than we thought, and some seemingly trivial things were very difficult to accomplish. What motivated us all this time? It's you! The person, who writes that can\u2019t wait for our wallet. The one, who says that his son has taken away his own wallet because it is so cool and he wants to order another one. All your feedback is a huge charge of motivation and energy for us!",

      "The C.R.-Mfee. (Chain Reaction Magnetic Force Engineering Energy.) And it all started with the inspiration of the 9/11, in how in the 21st century with such advance technology, elevators/lifts on high rise buildings could still not be used in an emergency, that really upset me so much, that I decided to find a way to make it possible to be safe enough in order to be used in an emergency, in order to save more lives. I knew that if it were possible, there would only be one man in history that could make it possible, and that would be the great Nikola Tesla. Therefor I took it upon myself to study the great man I so much heard about and his work, where I now have copies of over 1,200 pages of his work and over 200 of his patents, and from his inspiration and work, the C.R.-Mfee was born, taking over twenty years before I had a breakthrough in 2022. I have evidence on video with the models I have created to show the full potential of the C.R.-Mfee that shows that it does work on a 99% accuracy, but until I build a prototype I cannot work out the other missing 1%, and this is why I need enough funds to hire a private place to work on and enough materials to create some kind of a prototype.",

      "If some people can't contribute, that is ok, but that doesn't mean they can't help, as their help in someway or another will contribute towards the C.R.-Mfee success.",

      "Hi, my name is Nancy and I'm the inventor of patent pending XA360 Mobility board. I'm a Pilates instructor, personal trainer, fascia stretch and corrective exercise specialist, dietitian/nutrition coach, holistic lifestyle/stress and sleep management coach and Reiki master. My experiences in the health and wellness field allowed me to develop a tool that not only enhances physical performance but also improves alignment, flexibility and overall mobility.",
      "I have worked with thousands of people and almost all of them had the same things in common: hard time activating certain muscles. imbalances in the body, tightness and loss of flexibility and balance. They were in constant pain, taking medications or needing physical therapy or surgery. Working as a Pilates instructor and Personal trainer, I saw too many people doing exercises incorrectly, using wrong muscles, using momentum or lack of control in movement. My dedication to helping individuals move better to get stronger was the driving force behind XA360.",
      "XA360 is short for ACSSA, which is my unique method of training: Activate, Control, Strengthen, Stretch and Align. XA360, an innovative fitness tool designed to redefine the way people approach mobility, strength and overall wellness that can be used on the floor or on the Pilates reformer or chair. It is designed to promote proper movement patterns and alignment. Equipped with a unique rotating mechanism, the board provides instant feedback when the user's movement is incorrect, or their weight distribution is uneven. The challenge? Keep the board as still as possible, thereby encouraging the user to fine-tune their form and enhance control.",
      "But the XA360 isn't just about correction - it's about transformation. Purposefully rotating the board allows the users to achieve deeper stretches, unlocking new levels of flexibility and mobility. Whether you're building core strength, improving balance or enhancing flexibility, XA360 is fitness all-in-one solution. This groundbreaking board offers unparalleled versatility and precision, making it a must-have for the fitness enthusiasts, athletes and physical therapy professionals alike.",
      "I have a passion for Pilates and fitness and helping people.  Your support will make my vision of helping people move better, get stronger and feel better a reality. By helping people with better body awareness, increase strength, balance and flexibility and minimize imbalances in the body, it helps prevent injuries and surgeries thus improving quality of life.",
      "VERSATILITY of XA360 Board",
      "Pilates: XA 360 Board can be used on the Pilates reformer, Cadillac, chair and on the mat. Most classical and contemporary exercise can be done on the board but using less spring tension than usual. It takes your Pilates to the next level. Instead of having to come up with new exercises, be challenged more by using the board.",
      "Training: Feel the burn in your muscles by using slow controlled movements rather than going heavier. Let your muscles do the work instead of your joints. XA360 board helps you focus on your form instead of using momentum. Standing on the board while doing upper body exercises helps work the functional muscles in your legs.",
      "Physical Therapy: Strengthen your muscles pre and post operation, increase flexibility and range of motion with XA360 board. Learn how to use the board from your physical therapist an continue using at home for faster recovery.",
      "Golf: Strengthen and stretch the muscles that help with your swing and rotation for a more powerful golf swing. Stretch before and after your game to increase flexibility and prevent injuries",
      "Fascia Stretch: Purposefully rotating the board helps to get into deeper stretches while activating the muscles and increases flexibility and range of motion. Great for people who are tight and have difficulty getting down and up on the floor and limited range of motion.",
      "What We Need:",
      "I currently have a working prototype and am doing a pre-launch to raise $50K in capital for manufacturing, advertising, technology and development of fitness app on how to use the board. I'm doing a pre-sale of XA360 to have enough orders to start manufacturing in June 2025 and hoping to ship by mid-August 2025.",

    "description": "ONE WASH RESTORE YOUR GARMENTS TO NEW",
    "company_name": "Wajahat Hussain",
    "allParagraphs": [
      "ONE WASH RESTORE YOUR GARMENTS TO NEW",
      "What if you could sustainably, easily restore your legendary concert t-shirt, your ex\u2019s hoodie they left, your dad's perfect shirt finally handed down, your kid's favorite sweater, the dress that defined your 20\u2019s or the precious first day garments that your baby came home in.",
      "From an idea to a reality - even the early stage prototype tests provided excellent results, such as the hoodie above from Anna and her son Alfred.",
      "We all have that worn out favourite garment sitting in our closet. A piece of clothing with so many good memories, that\u2019s been lost to time, the color faded, the surface rough, bobbled, pilled, the hems and cuffs stretched and shapeless.",
      "What if there was a way to restore them simply and sustainably?",
      "We\u2019ve tried and tested ALL the \u2018\u2019solutions\u2019\u2019 including garment shavers, softeners, razors, brighteners, scissors, combs, sticky tape, detergents, sand paper, pumice stones, elbow grease and more.",
      "BIORESTORE replaces all of these tedious and time consuming tools with a simple, sustainable, scientific and smart solution.",
      "To create an easy to use solution we were inspired by the simplicity of your regular washing detergents. Our team have spent the past two years perfecting and simplifying the process & product.  Think of BIORESTORE  as detergent 2.0 or as a 're-tergent' - restoring, refreshing and renewing instead of simply cleaning.",
      "BIORESTORE is a Retergent which removes pilling / Lint / Garment Fuzz /Bobbles from the surface, which improves the colour brilliance, realigns the fibres, and reshapes the macro structure - ultimately meaning the shape of the garment.",
      "On a fabric level the improvement to textiles looks like the above examples, whilst on a garment, the improvement is dramatic.",
      "Why do clothes wear out? Whether your wardrobe is made up of mass market fashion staples, high-end pieces worn once in a while, or a daily uniform of sorts, the same thing always happens: over time, repeated washing with detergents and regular wearing means friction, abrasion and stretching of your clothing. This leads to pilling, de-shaping, and faded appearance of colors through a negative process of wear and tear called fibrillation.",
      "On a macro and a micro level, fibrillation is bad news for garments, with fibrillations  becoming visible on the surface of the garment as pills / lint / fluff / bobbles. These lead to colours looking dull, prints appearing faded, the surface no longer soft, smooth or with a sheen, the cuffs and collars become stretched & worn, and the overall fit of the garment becomes shapeless and loose. Simply put, your clothing does not look like it did the moment your eyes and hands met your favorite garment for the first time.",
      "It\u2019s easy to assume your garment is beyond repair and it\u2019s time to purchase a replacement. However, the original garment & colour you loved isn\u2019t gone. It\u2019s simply hidden under a thin layer of accumulated fibre bundles that obscure both the original colour and fabric surface texture. Underneath this micro mass is a garment waiting for a second chance and to avoid the bottomless pit of global landfill.",
      "Enzymes are available in abundance in nature, acting as catalysts that speed up processes of transformation and conversion in billions of natural and organic processes.",
      "For example, the coffee and juice you drank and breakfast you ate this morning are being digested, broken down and doing there magic in your stomach, converting to energy all with the help of enzymes.",
      "The biggest benefit of enzymes is that they are smart, really smart, only activating under suitable conditions and deactivating when those conditions are removed or are not optimal.",
      "Simply put, during optimal conditions at 40\u00b0C / 104\u00b0F the movement and agitation of a home laundry wash with BIORESTORE, the active enzyme ingredients identify, target and remove the damaged, problem causing Pilling / Lint / Fluff Fibres on the garment surface and deep inside the fabric structure.",
      "We know your curious, so here's the science, once the enzymes have targeted these fibres, an enzymatic hydrolysis reaction weakens these fibres from the main structure, the force from the washing machine removed loose fibres restoring the garment. Its like a lock and key, one is designed for the other, and the lock (your garment) won\u2019t open without the key (BIORESTORE enzymes.). This is why our product only works with cotton & cotton blends.",
      "And whats great for us, and good for you to know is that all of the BIORESTORE ingredients have been approved by EU and US regulatory authorities.",
      "BIORESTORE is a retergent made with enzymes and consciously selected ingredients.",
      "In comparison to other Laundry Products often containing up-to 29 ingredients, BIORESTORE is limited & minimal formulation of 6 essential ingredients only. Unlike traditional laundry products, we have refrained from adding chemicals just for the sake of aesthetics.",
      "For example, the colour of the BIORESTORE powder is chalky, which comes from a conscious decision to skip any whitening agents, therefore keeping the purest, simplest, and most minimal form of the product.",
      "It additionally means that the powder contains no fragrance - only a very faint, neutral smell that won\u2019t leave any scent behind on your garment.",
      "Crucially, compared to traditional laundry solutions, BIORESTORE does not contain any silicons, softeners or optical brighteners, that bond with the fabric and deposit a layer of chemicals on the surface of your clothes.",
      "For full transparency we share our ingredients list with you, which have been fully certified and approved by both EU and US regulatory authorities.",
      "Ingredients:",
      "< 5% Ethoxylated fatty alcohol. 10-60% granulated enzymes, sodium sulphate.   > 5 - 15% Non ionic tensioniser, sodium citrate,  adipic acid.",
      "To get here, we started with garments at the end of their life and worked our way backwards. By this we mean, we started with our own worn-out clothes and our direct experience of witnessing textile waste in landfills all around the world.",
      "While we knew that these mountains of wasted garments could be repurposed or recycled, we wondered if they could instead be renewed and restored.",
      "With over 25 years of experience from the fashion, textile and material science's industry, with deep knowledge of working with textile chemistry and technology from laundry to lab and factory floor to design studio we understood and shared the frustration of loosing favorite garments to time.",
      "To solve this, we did what we know best - we studied the yarns, inspected the garment failures, crunched the numbers and analysed the data to develop a solution which we call BIORESTORE.",
      "It's simple, sustainability, and for us quite naturally our first thought is always - sustainability.",
      "Let's start with the disposal and destruction - The US alone, dumps  17 million tons of textile waste each year, that\u2019s the equivalent of 75,000+ Statue of Liberty\u2019s, towering over NYC bleeding chemicals, dyes and effluent into the environment, slowly breaking down over 100\u2019s of years.",
      "Secondly is the massive consumption of materials and resources in the production of new clothing on a rapidly increasing cyclical scale of consumption. This footprint to produce simple items like a T-shirt is huge, and destructive towards natural habitats and systems, with a a t-shirt requiring upto 3500 litres of water in its journey from cotton plant to finished and store ready goods.",
      "We could go on, presenting more and more shocking statistics, however the simple fact is that we all buy, consume and dispose of far too many items of clothing when they could be easily, simply and sustainably renewed and restored.",
      "BIORESTORE has been in development for several years. From the initial prototype until now, it has been thoroughly tested on all types of textile products and materials in exactly the same way we would carry out tests whilst developing products for the large brands.",
      "While all the elements in developing BIORESTORE were selected consciously based on their safety & eco attributes we went a step further. BIORESTORE was independently evaluated by a globally renown lab - INTERTEK achieving both REACH (EU) and EPA TSCA & California Prop 65 US safety standards",
      "With our deep knowledge in textile technology, we have utilized internationally recognized textile testing mechanisms to capture the improvement in pilling and colour vibrancy. This has been measured through colour spectrometry and can be viewed on a microscopic level, and of course with visually as improvement of the garments surface and color.",
      "Once satisfied with the results in a controlled environment, we went out and created a trial group of over 150 people both inside and outside of Sweden who then tested the product in their own home laundry machines.",
      "The simple-to-use BIORESTORE home laundry solution has been designed to work in a similar way to regular home laundry detergents. There the similarities end, and the patent pending science of BIORESTORE Retergent begins.",
      "Each box of BIORESTORE can restore upto 5-6 adult garments of 10 children garments or a total weighing upto 1kg of textiles.",
      "Our simple visual guide below will help you to calculate the weight of garments.",
      "BIORESTORE is not always a miracle worker, and there are certain things BIORESTORE can\u2019t fix including:",
      "BIORESTORE is created for use on cotton and cotton blended fabrics, meaning any garment that is from 100% Cotton to 50% Cotton blended with other fibres.",
      "BIORESTORE is suitable for use across a wide range of garments and textile products, below is just a few of our favorite prodcuts to BIORESTORE.",
      "BIORESTORE has been designed to work with cotton and cotton blends, as this is a huge part of the clothing that we wear. This means that  BIORESTORE will not work on 100% synthetic fibres, or animal fibres such as wool, cashmere or silk.",
      "If you do wash synthetic- or animal fibre-based garments, not to worry. Your garments won't get damaged, they just won't be restored  in the the same way cotton garments will be.",
      "Where garments are made with a blend of fibres ie. cotton and wool, or cotton and polyester, the cotton will be restored and the other fibres will not be affected or damaged in any way.",
      "Visit our website:",
      "www.bio-restore.com",

      "In 2018 we launched our first product on Kickstarter and it was an instant success. Since then we shipped 50 AquaShield units worldwide and received a ton of feedback from our backers. Based on these, we improved almost every part of the AquaShield.",
      "It tracks all important environmental parameters like PH, EC, temperature, humidity, light intestity, VPD, dew point and much more. With AquaShield, you can automate your hydroponic or aquaponic system: you can control grow lights, pumps, valves or any other active component. The device is capable to connect to the internet, so you can access your AquaShield anytime, anywhere.",
      "Produce high quality crops using automation. AquaShield helps you to save time, reduce cost and work more efficiently. AquaShield can control 8 devices (grow lights, pumps, fans etc.) simultaneously.",
      "AquaShield 2.0 can also host PWM (pulse width modulation) enabled dosing pumps, LED grow lights, servos and much more.",
      "For an easier use, we also developed our own dosing pumps, that can easily control your PH (use PH+ or PH-) or maintain the optimal EC by adding nutrients based on the AquaShield\u2019s EC readings.",
      "The in-house developed software tracks all sensors real-time, stores all data and alerts you if needed.",

      "Controlling features of the AquaShield Connect: activate relays and dosing pump setup",
      "Automation with the AquaShield Connect: Time and sensor based workflows and alerting features",
      "AquaShield 2.0 is commercial ready, but we need your help to ramp up production. AquaShield has 9 different PCB boards that only could be manufactured economically if we order in larger quantities. With larger order quantities we can also negotiate better prices for the housing and sensors, so we will have more money to spend on further development of the device and the software.",
      "Please be aware that all shipping costs, VAT and sales taxes will be collected after the campaign is over.",
      "We\u2019re a Budapest, Hungary based company, so we will ship all perks from Hungary. Taxes will vary depending on where we deliver the perks. We have to charge VAT, if your shipping address is in the European Union.",
      "In other cases - for example if you back us from the United States - we won\u2019t charge any taxes, however sales taxes and custom fees may apply, might be levied on your parcel. The charge of the fees depends on the customs office / specific local post office of the destination country.",

      "We have worked extremely hard to ready this product for Indiegogo and full-scale manufacturing and fulfillment, but here are what we see as the risks and our plan to assess them:",
      "MANUFACTURING: The manufacturer is lined up, and we have quality assurance people on site during production.",
      "FULFILLMENT: Sometimes things get a bit crazy and stuff happens that can't be planned for: a supplier misses a deadline, customs clearance or a shipment gets lost. Those things could cause a delay.",

      "The most loved toiletries travel roll is back and even better!",
      "Tashtego is the ultimate solution to the long-suffering toiletries bag. Inspired by the neat and organized design of tool rolls, Tashtego is a clean, sanitary, minimalist way to organize and store all your travel essentials.",
      "Say goodbye to hair in toothbrushes and exploded shampoo over your razor. With Tashtego, all your brushes, razors, and bottles are securely separated from each other and easy to find.",
      "Roll up all your personal care tools in a neat, organized, easily displayable kit. Never search for your toiletries again!",
      "Tashtego 2.0 is an better, more functional version of our first design. We read all the reviews (both positive and negative) and worked with a group of our most die-hard fans to reinvent, enhance, and improve our 1.0 product.",
      "If you\u2019ve ever travelled, you know the pain of carrying your hygiene essentials. Ziploc bags get messy and gross - and the \u201chigh end\u201d toiletry bags are even worse...",
      "Everything mixes together, gets lost, and leaks all sorts of goo, gunk, and grossness over the very tools you use to clean yourself.",
      "Do you enjoy digging through the black hole of toiletries?",
      "How about your toothbrush having a three-way with your hairbrush and toe nail clippers?",
      "Or your shampoo spilling all over your essentials?",
      "Are you tired of sorting through junk just to find your personal hygiene tools dirty and disgusting?",
      "It\u2019s time for a change.",
      "Tashtego keeps all your toiletries separate and organized. No more digging and no more inappropriate make out sessions between hygiene items.",
      "Mesh pockets keep your essentials neatly organized and easy to find - so you can grab what you need when you need them. Plus, you can lay Tashtego flat or hang it up for easy access.",
      "All Your Essentials Organized",
      "Lay flat or hang!",
      "Camping, backpacking, vacations, business trips, festivals, retreats and more - Tashtego is perfect for any and every travel situation.",
      "Throw it in your bag or suitcase without worry. You\u2019ll save space while keeping your toiletries safe from each other and the rest of your bag.",
      "Tashtego 2.0 also expands and contracts based on what you put in it. Save extra space if you\u2019re leaving for a weekend and pack extra for that long vacation.",
      "Plus, Tashtego 2.0 makes TSA easy to pass! Simply pull it out for screening. Your items will be easily and fully displayed for the TSA agent - no worries, no hassle, no mess.",
      "Tashtego 2.0 is made from heavy-duty, high-strength nylon. This makes it ultra-durable, ultra-light, and 100% waterproof. Plus, the exterior is soft and nice to the touch.",
      "If you ever need to wash it, just rinse it down in the sink or throw it in the washing machine.",
      "Tashtego 2.0 is completely machine washable!",
      "We replaced our canvas pockets with durable, unidirectional stretchable mesh pockets. This lets you easily see all your content and makes Tashtego more secure and versatile. Carry your full-size toothbrush, toothpaste, floss, hairbrush, razor, everything without worry.",
      "You can even store items smaller than the pocket! They\u2019ll still be safely secured thanks to the mesh lining.",
      "Because they only stretch one way, our pockets will never stretch out on you. This means you don\u2019t have to worry about baggy lining or losing the tight snug of your mesh overtime or over use.",
      "Tashtego 2.0 lasts - pockets and all.",
      "To make sure your items stay snug in Tashtego\u2019s pockets, we added a silicone bead backing that prevents your things from sliding out.",
      "Small or large, your essentials will be tight and secure in Tashtego. No more slipping and sliding.",
      "Our side zipper pockets lets you stash away smaller items and small liquid bottles - so they don\u2019t spill everywhere. The zippers are made by YKK - the world\u2019s leading zipper manufacturer - which means you\u2019re in good hands.",
      "Our top flap keeps all your essentials clean and keeps out water, dust, and any undesirables. But that\u2019s not it. With Tashtego 2.0, we added additional pockets for your small stash items - such as nail clippers and chapstick.",
      "Get even more from the same awesome design everyone loves!",
      "Tashtego lays flat on its back - keeping your brushes and razors away from the bacterial cesspool called the countertop. Lay it down on any counter and easily find your essentials in a flash!",
      "If there\u2019s no place to lay your Tashtego, you can also hang it! Dual metal grommets lets you hang Tashtego practically anywhere.",
      "Hang diagonally or levelled! We added an extra grommet so you can have your toiletries leveled and secure while hanging. Whether it\u2019s a towel rack, shower curtain, or even a tree - you\u2019ll have all your personal care tools at arms reach!",
      "We replaced our old notched strap with a versatile G-hook that clips onto a daisy chain of webbing - letting you tighten and loosen your Tashtego as needed, with zero slack.",
      "Wrap up your minimalist setup or roll up your entire countertop setup! Tashtego will accommodate all your needs and firmly close without extra space between the roll. Get full, secure closure - no matter what!",
      "Though we created Tashtego for our hygiene tools, people have used it for much more than that. Whether it\u2019s for camera gear, medical tools, everyday carries, lotion or as a knife roll - use Tashtego for whatever you need!",
      "The durable material and compact design makes it ideal for any situation where you need your tools clean, separated, organized, and ready to go!",
      "Tashtego is the ultimate travel toiletries kit. No more unsanitary messes or mixing of brushes - keep all your personal care essentials compact, ready to go and easy to find!",
      "Hi, I\u2019m Parker.",
      "I like to make things. I make pens, knives, treehouses, drones and, now, anything else my kids want to make. But the biggest thing I\u2019ve made is an airplane.",
      "Yeah, the kind you get in and fly. I flew it all over our beautiful country - Death Valley, Maine, Florida, through the Bahamas and other places where the \u201cairport\u201d is really just a patch of crushed coral or a clearing carved out of the forest. These are places where there aren\u2019t mechanics to work on airplanes, so taking tools along is a pretty good idea.",
      "Airplanes can only lift a certain amount of weight and there isn\u2019t much space, so you have to think carefully about what to take and how to pack it. Getting smacked in the face by a floating wrench really hurts.",
      "That\u2019s when I fell in love with tool rolls. Tool rolls can be small, barely larger than the tools themselves, the individual pockets keep everything organized and, since they\u2019re made out of fabric, they don\u2019t weigh much. It\u2019s easy to see if you\u2019re leaving a wrench buried in the grass. Mine didn\u2019t have to be nice, so I usually made them myself.",
      "So I launched the first version of Tashtego - the tool roll for your toiletries - on Kickstarter with huge success. 1,400 backers raised over $57,000 to make it a reality! I manufactured the products and shipped them around the world.",
      "People liked the product, but 1400 backers had lots of ideas for improvement.   So I hired a professional design firm and, together 15 of our most diehard fans,  we improved all the things we loved and added new features to solve the problems of the 1.0.",
      "Now, we\u2019re ready to get the new, improved Tashtego to you and reinvent toiletry travel bags forever.",
      "This project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 750+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $330MM raised between them.",

WIN 4 not only supports desktop graphics card docks with replaceable graphics cards, but also supports the GPD G1 mobile graphics card dock. Due to the Oculink port directly connecting to PCIe with 63Gbps of effective bandwidth, it can unleash the maximum performance of the discrete graphics card.\n* Dual OS refers to the support for SteamOS (system adaptation provided by Valve Corporation) in addition to Windows 10/11. However, WIN 4 is not limited to dual systems and can also support multiple systems. Some systems may lack driver support.",

There is no need to disassemble the device as it can be easily clipped onto the back of the device when needed.",
      "During gaming, the top cover of the device is typically not slid open. However, there are times when you need to press the Esc key to return to the game settings interface, and sliding open the cover each time can be inconvenient. To address this, we have added two customizable physical buttons on the back of the WIN 4 to easily customize combination keys and interval times.",
      "The L1/R1 trigger buttons of the WIN 4 come equipped with LED ambient lighting, featuring seven-color LED backlight effects with customizable colors and multiple lighting modes to choose from.

      "Although the GPD WIN 3, which was previously crowdfunded on Indiegogo, received widespread acclaim, there were also many shortcomings, particularly with regards to Intel's graphics driver issues, which caused many games to crash or display graphics errors. In contrast, the stability of AMD's graphics has been widely recognized. To address these issues and provide gamers with a better gaming experience, the WIN 4 has chosen to adopt the AMD Ryzen 7 6800U processor. The latest version of WIN 4 has been upgraded to the AMD Ryzen 7 8840U and Ryzen 5 8640U processors, and an Oculink interface has been added, which supports the GPD G1 graphics dock, providing gamers with a better experience.",

      "An excellent blade isn't enough. We think the handle needs to be a unique work of art as well.",
      "It all started pretty simply and honestly.",
      "After much searching, I found a supplier who would sell me awesome knives without the handles. I bought six, and figured if I made them up and sold a few, I would get a free knife to use at work. So I did just that.",
      "I posted them up on Facebook marketplace on a whim, and by the next day, I had received 70 messages asking for them.",
      "I bought another 20 after that, and they were gone within two days, which is when I decided I could seriously do something special with these.",
      "So why do I need Indiegogo?",
      "I want to expand my range to a full set of knives with custom designed handles. The chef's knife has been a really well received product and I have had requests to expand on that range as one chef's knife wasn't enough.",
      "Sadly large suppliers will only sell to me if I can get enough orders to justify their production runs. I managed to get a few production samples which I experimented with and I was very happy with the quality of the blade. I am excited by the opportunity to create unique handles in all shapes and sizes for every variety of knife.",
      "With your help, I can order in Nakiri, Santoku, Utility, Boning and Bread knives. Then I can make up matching knife sets with unique handles that will make everybody jealous!",
      "So what makes these knives so special?",
      "I'm a chef, been at it for 18 years now, and I've gone through many knives. The biggest issue I had found was edge retention. You want your knives to stay sharp as long as possible, and after much research I found the magic metal - VG10.",
      "It is a stainless steel with a high carbon content containing 1% Carbon, 15% Chromium, 1% Molybdenum, 0.2% Vanadium, 1.5% Cobalt, and 0.5% Manganese.",
      "Basically, that means that it has all the properties of high carbon steels used in high end forged knives without the rusting and maintenance issues. The best of both worlds.",
      "With your backing, these are what I plan extend my range to:",
      "Now comes the fun part.",
      "I think a knife handle should reflect the user and not be identically mass produced. What I love won't be what somebody else will love. And for something you want to show off, it needs to be awesome!",
      "Choose your favourite, and add your customisation in the notes during checkout.",
      "The chef's knives had been my trade, and I thought I should show off a few comments I found online of them.",
      "Risks and challenges",
      "I think the biggest challenge will be depending on how many orders I receive. Handles like the blue/yellow/black resin I can make an unlimited amount of. However, the raw timbers are limited to material availability. So if I receive 1000 orders for just Olive timber, I may need to write down out of stock on it.",
      "I will also adjust the delivery date after a certain amount of orders come in, so I can keep within the promised delivery date.",
      "Apart from that, I've got a system set up to make them, and have gotten a fair chunk of practice at it now, so I can pump out whatever handles you love!",

Just convert your hoodie into a backpack within seconds, and keep your hands free while gaining some additional storage.",

We use breathable fabrics and nanotechnology textile finishing. Hoodies are made of 90% cotton and 10% polyester and brushed inside for extra softness. We draw abundantly from sportswear solutions when it comes to practicality, lightness, and comfort.",

      "Well, it's not the first time we introduce a new product to the market via Kickstarter. We are experienced entrepreneurs who created dozens of successful brands. Fashion retail has been our everyday reality for 20 years, so we know very well how to execute and deliver. The Jay23 brand already exists, and it has all the infrastructure necessary to work.",
      "And so, under usual circumstances, there would be close to zero potential risks here. However, the pandemic has changed how the world works and operates. The whole production process takes place locally and with the use of locally sourced materials, so, thankfully, we shouldn't encounter any delays, caused by e.g. closed borders, before shipment starts. But potential shipment issues could appear if the pandemic forces specific transit regulations between countries.",
      "Also, regardless of the pandemic, bank holidays or customs in your country could delay your receiving of the product. In any case, we promise to keep you informed. Our policy here is full transparency.",

      "It's the all-in-one smart riding solution you've been searching for.",
      "Interview with Digital Trends",
      "The X-Series\u2019 full-face fit is comfortable and its stylish all-in-one design includes top of the range built-in HD surrounding sound speakers, noise reduction microphone, and front 2K camera as standard. The X-AR also includes the HUD, AR projections, 2K rear-facing camera and optical waveguide technology.",
      "Our optional Tron design with LED strip lights gives riders the opportunity to truly stand out from the crowd.",
      "If you are an enthusiastic and creative rider, we have good news for you!",
      "Cooperating with a notable one-hundred-year-old brand, LAZER Helmets, we are releasing the JARVISH X painted version: ANGELO X",
      "Designed by LAZER's chief designer and painted as a Samurai on fire, Angelo X is like a tiger on the road which is fierce and captivating, and brings you speed and individuality!",
      "The X-AR model leverages optical waveguide technology on the HUD for riders who prefer visual instructions. The technology behind this ensures that even in bright light, these projections are visible. The HUD can be controlled and retracted easily via voice command.",
      "The X-AR helmet has the ability to display directions, to notify the wearer of traffic and weather conditions, indicators, speed, hazard road signs and incoming caller IDs on the HUD.",
      "Both the top of the range X-AR and standard X model come with 2K built-in front camera as standard. The X-AR model also houses a 2K rear-facing camera which can be activated on demand by voice so the rider has 360\u00b0 visibility while on the road.",
      "Journeys can be recorded in FHD video via the built-in front 2K camera and stored on an up to 256GB removable memory card in the helmet. The video can also be broadcasted in real-time to a rider's social media account by voice command.",
      "Never miss a turn with integrated navigation set via the JARVISH app. Users input a destination address by voice to receive in-helmet audio directions and, with the JARVISH X-AR, also on the head-up display.",
      "The new JARVISH X-Series connects with voice services such as Apple\u2019s Siri or OK Google. Both the X-AR and X helmets are voice-activation only (no tap-to-talk), allowing riders to control the cameras, make a call, adjust the volume, play music and more, while keeping their focus on the road.",
      "Automated sensors turns the helmet on when you wear it and turns the helmet off when it\u2019s taken off. Gyro, e-compass, accelerometer and ambient light sensors analyze weather & road conditions to provide real-time alerts.",
      "JARVISH X-series smart helmets also feature an individual audio processor for active noise cancellation and high-resolution sound regeneration quality. Our proprietary noise cancellation technology reduces wind noise and enhances the human voice to get clear call quality even up to 100 kph / 60 mph.",
      "At only 3.08lbs/1.4kgs (X) and 3.75lbs/1.7kgs (X-AR), the pure carbon fiber helmet provides ultimate protection with extreme comfort.",
      "Both the X-AR and standard X model are fully certified, including ECE R22.05 (Europe, Australia), DOT (US and Canada), CNS 2396, CNS 13438, CNS 13439 (Asia), FCC (electronic radiation safety certifications).",
      "FLCB not only breaks the battery normal outlook but also the production process of traditional LPB. With ultra-thin and flexible features, FLCB could open endless possibilities. It can give JARVISH more design freedom to deliver a Smart Helmet.",
      "Another amazing feature of FLCB is the safety. A FLCB cell in use keeps working even through is cut into pieces and stabbed with a pair of scissors. Experiments confirmed that FLCB is intrinsically safe and still workable even after folding, hitting, penetrating, cutting, or burning.",
      "Experienced riders know any helmet is only as comfortable (and safe!) as how well the helmet fits. Building on our decades of riding experience we sweated the details to get the fitting just right.",
      "Do not rely on sizing from another helmet manufacturer when pre-ordering your JARVISH Smart Helmet. No two helmets fit alike.",
      "To find your fit, start by measuring your head with a flexible tape measure. The measuring tape should be held just above your eyebrows, the helmet will fit snuggly in the same area as a \u201cbaseball cap.\u201d  See the sizing chart below.",
      "JARVISH was founded in 2014 by the previous Advance Technology Division (ATD) team of Foxconn with the vision to bring superior design, high-quality accessible head-mounted products to consumers around the world. After two years of research the company launched the first smart helmet in the market in 2017.",
      "We're on a mission to make your motorcycle as smart as you.",
      "JARVISH specializes in the integration of software and hardware for motorcycle helmets. LAZER HELMETS, a world-renowned helmet supplier, highly recognizes the potential of JARVISH. Alexander de Vos van Steenwijk, Chairman of LAZER HELMETS, reckons the smart wearable device is the future. That\u2019s why JARVISH and LAZER partnered to develop the first smart helmet, Monaco Evo S, to provide riders the safest riding experience. From that, JARVISH further improved the function of Monaco Evo S as generation II and re-named it as Monaco Evo S2.",
      "In the meantime, the police force in Taiwan has cracked multiple fraud cases while wearing JARVISH Smart Helmets. The helmets, outfitted with new tech, allowed policemen to quietly gather evidence in numerous situations.",
      "We\u2019ve spent countless hours designing and building the newest form of smart wearable AR that will upgrade any motorcycle ride.",
      "The purpose of the campaign is to be able to recruit more engineers to make the HUD fully integrated into the main board system, and create AR applications for the JARVISH smart helmet ecosystem. To do this, we need $50,000.",
      "As a Kickstarter exclusive, we\u2019re offering up to a 27% discount to make sure we reach our goal. This is a limited offer only available during our campaign.",

      "The sensation of snowboarding with the convenience of a skateboard",
      "The Freebord 5-X replicates the movement of a snowboard on pavement. Everyone loves fresh powder and perfect bluebird conditions, but the reality for most of us is that the resorts are far away, and the snow conditions aren\u2019t always great. If your passion is snowboarding then you're in luck. Say goodbye to expensive lift tickets, long lift lines, and getting snaked by Jerry. Get the Freebord 5-X and turn any neighborhood into your personal snowboard run.",
      "The latest feature of the new truck system is the independent suspension hangers. This new design eliminates the stiff response of a traditional skateboard bushing and maximizes the turning radius of the board to match the same trajectory as a snowboard.",
      "For years beginners have struggled to master the technique of edge control. The Freebord 5-X delivers a playful and forgiving ride with precise and predictable transfers. The new system makes going edge-to-edge simple and fun.",
      "Another benefit of the 5-X design is that the springs smooth out the ride over rough surfaces and dampen vibrations making for one of the smoothest rides ever.",
      "Do you like jibbing and park tricks? Well, this design changes everything because of the way they disperse weight across each individual edge wheel. This opens up the doors for butters and a whole new world of tricks we've yet to even scratch the surface.",
      "In Freebording lingo, the term rocker refers to the distance the edge wheels are raised above the ground. This effect is what gives riders the ability to drift, carve, and slide the board in a lateral motion. The motion of sliding a Freebord is different from a longboard or traditional skateboard because unlike kicking out a power slide, sliding on a Freebord is about shifting weight from edge-to-edge. Just like snowboarding, you can apply more pressure on an edge to control your stopping power. The Freebord 5-X was designed to replicate the feeling of snowpack underneath your board.",
      "Since 1998, we have always stayed true to the progression of our board. We don\u2019t make false claims about being the absolute best snowboard simulator. These are simply facts that have been proven year-after-year by a worldwide rider base of avid snowboarders.",
      "We have customers who report back saying that they rode black diamonds on their first day of snowboarding. There are countless others who are simply happy to keep their snow legs fresh all year long. Whether you're getting ready for the next season or just trying to keep the momentum going, picking up a Freebord is the way to go.",
      "In addition to the four edge wheels, the Freebord has two additional center wheels on the board\u2019s centerline that rotate 360 degrees. The center wheels are slightly closer to the ground than the edge wheels.  This is what simulates the base of a snowboard allowing riders to initiate slides in any direction, check their speed or stop like they would on snow.",
      "By positioning your weight over the board's edges you can carve deep turns.  Shift weight to the base, and\u2014just like a snowboard\u2014it slides, allowing riders to check speed, navigate tight terrain, drift a 180 into switch or come to a complete stop.",
      "Our goal is to bring Freebording to neighborhoods around the world. After 20 years of doing business, we are excited to bring to life our vision of snowboarding the streets. We believe in being a rider owned and operated business and need a strong community of riders, supporters, and backers of this project to make this dream of ours come true. Get your lift ticket for life by backing this project and ordering the Freebord 5-X. We look forward to catching you out on the streets! ~Freebord Mfg.",

      "Our tribute to a dynasty of Noble lords and leaders, who have contributed to making the history of the city of Verona in Italy, gathering at their court nationally renowned artists.",
      "A limited and numbered collection: for each series we propose 11 chronograph models and 11 automatic models. A total of 300 numbered pieces with chrono movements and 300 numbered pieces with automatic movements.",
      "Years 40's: an icon of watchmaking was born. Year 2020: the legend reinvents itself in a contemporary fashion. We were inspired by an icon of the past, a model of the 30's - 40's that is still among the most sought after by collectors all over the world. A timepiece that has made the history of watchmaking, a timeless, legendary icon. We transported it into the 21st century, modernizing it just enough to make it even more immortal in the memory of all those who have seen, worn or even dreamed of it. From unattainable, we will make it available to all those who have always wanted it. Its shape, style and charisma are now featuring in this new model. We developed two models, a chronograph with a hybrid mechanical quartz movement, and an automatic custom movement only time. A product conceived, designed and created with passion, and to which we dedicated a refined attention to detail. Discover with us this new Italian proposal that revives, updating it, a timeless icon of wrist watchmaking. A \"must have\" within everyone's reach. We restyled its external layout, blending it with an iconic new brand that is meant to be a tribute to the millennial history of the amazing Italian city of Verona.",
      "The movement Seiko NH35 (or NH35A) is a 24-jewel automatic caliber based on the 7s26. It is therefore a robust and reliable movement. Being a \"strong and very reliable movement\", it has no finishes or aspects aimed at particularly increasing its prestige, compared to the high-end movements. This movement guarantees great reliability and good precision at a competitive price. Nevertheless, in our case, the caliber has been embellished with a specific customization that includes an \"IP Yellow Gold\" plating for the rotor, and a laser engraving on the visible part of the oscillating weight.",
      "The diameter is 27.4 mm and the thickness is 5.32 mm. The rotor charges bidirectionally and the power reserve is 41 hours. It features a date at 3 o'clock, machine stop and the ability to wind it manually, unlike the 7s26 caliber which does not provide the possibility of manual winding.",
      "The claimed accuracy stands at an error of -35/+ 40 seconds per day; however, when properly tuned, its performance is usually closer to -15/+ 15 seconds per day. It operates at a frequency of 21600 oscillations per hour, therefore an average frequency. The shock protection system is the Diashock, which is the standard shock protection system adopted by Seiko. The customized rotor, although it may seem a \"trivial\" thing, is actually synonymous with great attention to detail, reflected in all the technical and construction details of ours watches.",

      "Best known for its Shakespeare associations, Verona attracts a multinational gaggle of tourists to its pretty piazzas and knot of lanes, most in search of Romeo, Juliet and all that. But beyond the  Renaissance romance, Verona is a bustling center, its heart dominated by a huge, remarkably well-preserved 1st-century amphitheater, the venue for the city\u2019s annual summer opera festival. Add to that countless churches, a couple of architecturally fascinating bridges over the Adige, regional wine and food from the Veneto hinterland and some impressive art, and Verona shapes up as one of northern Italy's most attractive cities. And all this just a short hop from the shores of stunning Lake Garda.",

For over 15 years he had followed the product development and related manufacturing activities for leading Italian international brands, in the watch and bijoux sector. Since 2000 he has been designing and developing watch collections under the \"Damotime\u2122 Verona\" brand, spotting various fashion trends. Since 2015, he has dedicated himself to a new entrepreneurial venture with her own brand GIULIETTAVERONA\u00ae. In 2018 conceives the \"I Signori di Verona\" project and, between the end of 2019 and the beginning of 2020, he has been developing the collection to be launched on Kickstarter.",
      "Monica, the elegant and contemporary soul of the team. For 20 years she has been working in the jewelry and accessories sector with passion and dedication. She has a particular flair for style and trends, and is naturally inclined to spot beauty. In her work she relates to customers and suppliers with empathy, attention to detail and pragmatism. A counterbalance to the originality and creative twist brought by Davide, with whom she shares the most beautiful projects of their lives.",
      "Alessandro, with him ideas materialize in the form of sketches, drawings, photos, visuals, creative concepts. Rational and thoughtful, he is the perfect mix between Davide's exuberance and Monica's pragmatism. Since the start of the GIULIETTAVERONA\u00ae project in 2015, Alessandro is the one who knows how to put the team's ideas on paper, making them effective and adding that \"artist's touch\" to each project.",
      "We have decided to create a real Limited Edition: once sold out, the models of a certain series will no longer be produced. Each new series will be offered with some differentiating elements. We want our products to be special and unique to you.Our commitment to those who will support us is to continue bringing to light new projects and exclusive proposals.",

      "A minimalist utility knife perfect for Everyday Carry (EDC)",
      "We are very excited to introduce our latest creation: Titanium OFUK\u2122 - Open Frame Utility Knife.",
      "Small and lightweight to carry anywhere.  There when you need it most!",
      "Easy to open and close with just one hand.",
      "Symmetrical design so you can operate with either hand.",
      "Choose the length of blade extension to fit your cutting need and control the depth of your incision.",
      "Removing dull blades and inserting new ones is easy, or simply rotate to the other half of the blade that is still sharp.",
      "Fit any standard utility blade. There is an endless selection for you to choose, from straight to serrated edge, stainless steel, titanium nitride coated to ceramic material.",
      "It simply disappears in your pocket.  No bulk!",
      "Weighs only 0.5 oz. without blade, and 0.7 oz. with blade; About the weight of three US quarter dollar coins.",
      "The unique single body, open frame is precision machined from Grade 5 Titanium billet.",
      "The slide button is made with premium 17-4 stainless steel material. An undercut chamfer beneath the button allows you to lift it up with your finger to dis-engage the blade.",
      "Pre-order your Titanium OFUK Now!",
      "Have you ever had an \"OFUK\" moment when you tried to use your knife and found its edge dulled or covered with gooey, sticky stuff?  If you are a knife guy, leave the dirty work to its little brother, the utility knife!",
      "- TITANIUM: Grade 5 Titanium (6Al-4V) is as light as aluminum, but as strong as steel.  Plus, it is corrosive resistant.  This premium material, used to be reserved exclusively for the aerospace industry, is the favorite material for EDC enthusiasts.",
      "- PVD Color Finish: PVD stands for Physical Vapor Deposition, a finishing process for vaporizing a proprietary solid compound in a high-tech vacuum chamber before it is deposited onto the surface of the part, atom by atom.  The result is a high performance finish that is super durable, scratch resistant and improves the appearance of the part.",
      "We wanted to design a perfect utility knife that we can use everyday.  The goal was simple: it has to be very easy to use and small.  Our eureka moment happened when we realized that most cutting jobs do not need the blade to be locked in place since the cutting movement is perpendicular to the blade edge.  After coming up with the slide button design that relies on friction and detents at the close and open positions, we realized two more things.  First, we can stop the blade at any position between the close and fully open position.  This lets us use the knife in special ways, like cutting the box with a controlled blade length and without cutting the content inside.  Second, since we can squeeze the button on both sides, we can basically hold the blade for puncturing/stabbing motion just like it's locked in place.",
      "We already paid the tooling and CNC fixtures for the frame and the slide button.  Everything is ready for production.",
      "Back us today and you will be the first to receive the Titanium OFUK at a great discount!",
      "We have successfully launched and fulfilled eight projects. We learned a lot from our past manufacturing and fulfillment processes. There are always risks and unexpected issues in launching a new product.",
      "The factory already made a lot of samples for us. All the tooling is finished and production will begin once the campaign ends.",

      "Applying Wonder-C Tex (*antibacterial fabric) that kills harmful substances such as athlete's foot bacteria and fungus and suppresses foot odor, Inevitable Insole proves its efficiency just with insole replacement. Wonder Feet Inevitable Insole is here to help you if you\u2019re suffering from athlete\u2019s foot and foot odor.",
      "It is known that 15% of the world's population has athlete's foot. 1 out of every 6 people has athlete's foot bacteria, and millions of people visit hospitals every year to receive treatment.",
      "Athlete's foot occurs with an infection by a fungus called 'Trichophyton Rubrum', and once it occurs, it becomes contagious, moving from skin to skin as a parasite. Athlete\u2019s foot bacteria can be infected to the face and ears, as well as toes, fingers and feet. Due to this contagiousness, the bacteria continuously re-occurs and it should be completely eradicated.",
      "1.  Foot (athlete\u2019s foot infiltrates feet)",
      "2.  Athlete\u2019s foot bacteria breeds inside the shoes",
      "3.  You try to weaken the bacteria by washing your feet and putting ointment on,",
      "4.  but the moment you put your feet back into the shoes, the bacteria infiltrates again",
      "5.   Vicious cycle repeats itself",
      "But with Wonder Feet?",
      "1. Foot infected with athlete's foot bacteria",
      "2. From the moment you put on the Wonder Feet shoes, the athlete\u2019s foot bacteria will be attacked, weakened and killed",
      "3.   When you take off your shoes, the Wonder Feet insole attacks the athlete's foot bacteria, killing them",
      "4.   When you keep your feet clean, athlete\u2019s foot bacteria gradually weaken",
      "Wonder-C Tex is a new anti-bacterial material made by whipping 99.9 % of pure copper into slices thinner than human hair.",
      "It is called \"Antibacterial copper\" due to the natural occurrence of antibacterial activity in copper.   By acting on bacteria and viruses such as E-coli and food poisoning bacteria, antimicrobial copper is highly effective in preventing infectious diseases and cross infection.  It is the strongest and non-toxic human-friendly antibacterial material, being a natural material.",
      "There is little variation in the antimaterial activity regardless of the particle size. Also, it has much better antibacterial power than silver (nano) and ceramic materials because it does not create resistant bacteria even after time.",
      "Antimicrobial effect stays unaffected by the external environment including heat and humidity. Antibacterial copper is a semi-permanent material that maintains its antibacterial powers even after discoloration or abrasion.",
      "Antibacterial copper is a natural antibacterial material that is harmless to the human body and the environment. It is 100% recyclable because no added chemicals are required, thanks to the natural antibacterial effects of copper itself. Even in recycled copper, the effect remains unchanged.",
      "In 2011, Dr. William Keevil of the University of Southampton, England, conducted an experiment to compare the antibacterial powers between 10 million super bacteria on stainless steel and on copper. While the super bacteria on stainless steel remained alive, those on copper were almost entirely killed in 9 minutes.",
      "In an average of 1 hour, the stench has dropped by over 90%.",

      "On top of wearing Wonder Feet, apply other athlete\u2019s foot medication on the market to maximize treatment effect. (Including toe-type athlete\u2019s foot)",
      "This is because Wonder Feet can both care for the foot and shoe environments where athlete\u2019s foot bacteria breed.",
      "Also, we recommend using Wonder Feet Insoles in matching numbers as your daily shoes to enhance effectiveness. This is to prevent the possibility of cross-contamination that could happen when you switch to normal soles from Wonder Feet soles.",
      "Hello friend.",
      "I'm Yuni,   the founder of Wonder Feet.   I would like to briefly introduce how the WONDER FEET came into the world.",
      "Originally, I had a job of making and distributing shoes in S. Korea. However, the shoes I usually sell have the cheapest insole to minimize cost, and I was always unsatisfied with the lack of cushioning because my feet were not comfortable.",
      "I had a chance to talk with the boss of a partner company, when I found out that using good materials makes more comfortable insoles. So, I developed an insole using a thick latex (6mm) without worrying about the cost and applied it to shoes and heels, which was met with positive response by the customers.",
      "Since then, I became more interested in people's feet and started to study the various types of functional insoles. But the question was why premium functional insoles were limited to foot arches, cushioning and structural problems.",
      "Actually, I thought the real issue with people's feet was athlete's foot and foot odor. Of course, not everyone has these problems, but I knew for a fact that quite a lot of people are suffering from this problem.",
      "I thought I had a solution to solve this problem by connecting it with the insole. Because feet are always in shoes and shoes are always laid with insoles.",
      "After desperately searching for a way, I finally found my answer.",
      "I thought it would be really cool if people could just say goodbye to the repulsive itch and shameful foot odor by simply replacing their insoles.",
      "So, I named my invention, Wonder Feet. Of course, arch supports and shock absorbing cushioning are basic functions.",
      "If you are suffering from athlete's foot, itching, foot odor for a long period of time, or are afraid to know how to prevent them, I recommend trying out Wonder Feet. I\u2019m more than confident they will help!",
      "Your friend,",
      "Yuni",
      "Q.  Is Wonder Feet only applicable to athlete\u2019s foot patients and those with foot odor?",
      "A.  No. Athlete\u2019s foot and foot odor are very common problems exposed to everyone, because they result from fungus bacteria that are easily infected even with the smallest contact with people around you.",
      "Q.  Is Wonder Feet effective on toenail athlete\u2019s foot, as well?",
      "A.   Toenail-type athlete\u2019s foot lasts longer and is more difficult to eradicate than athlete\u2019s foot. Wonder Fit effectively creates an environment in which athlete\u2019s foot bacteria cannot thrive, even for toe-type disease.",
      "Q. What if the odor remains even after I wear Wonder Feet insole?",
      "A.  Wonder Feet is not a deodorant, the odor eliminating effect doesn\u2019t come magically as soon as you put it on. The antibacterial copper fabric needs time to reduce the bacteria and odor. Foot odor will be eliminated in as early as 3 day, and usually within 7 days. But in case of severe symptoms, it could take up to a maximum of 15 days.",
      "Q. Does Wonder Feet help with plantar fasciitis?",
      "A. Of course. Wonder Feet has adopted a proper cushion and arch support structure to help people suffering foot pain.",
      "Q. Does it help with ankle or back pain?",
      "A. Wonder Feet's arch supports and heel features help your feet to better support your body's load.  If the arch of a foot collapses, it causes the body to lose balance. Wonder Feet insole will help both feet work well together to balance.",
      "Q. How thick is the insole?",
      "A.   Wonder feet has a thickness of 4mm for proper cushioning. Usually, insoles are about 2~3mm thick. So, it is recommended to use Wonder Feet in shoes that are slightly looser than others.",
      "Q. Do the insoles come in children\u2019s sizes, too?",
      "A.   Unfortunately, we could not prepare the children's size for this moment. But we\u2019ll consider them if there are requests by the consumers.",

      "WONDERTOOL's ozone-based laundry effectively eliminates 99% of bacteria and viruses in a matter of minutes, an outcome that traditional heat-based methods struggle to match. Conventional thermal washing studies reveal that nearly all pathogens require exposure to water at a scorching 160\u00baF (71\u00baC) for a lengthy 25-minute period to be rendered inactive. Moreover, the traditional process relies on a complex array of hazardous chemicals, including Chlorine, which is best avoided. In contrast, ozone initially oxidizes and eradicates bacteria and viruses before ultimately transforming into oxygen. With WONDERTOOL\u2122, most of the chemicals needed for achieving exceptional results are replaced by cold, ozone-saturated water.",

In fact, this ozonated cold water approach actually leaves your clothes feeling softer and fluffier while extending the lifespan of the fabric. You can trust that your clothes will emerge from the wash clean, devoid of any odors, grime, or chemical residues. Plus, there's no need to worry about the colors fading since WONDERTOOL\u2122 washes in cold water, ensuring your colors stay vibrant and intact.",
      "Traditional washing machines often subject clothes to significant wear and tear due to the dynamic loads of twisting and stretching, especially when combined with hot water and harsh chemicals. This process can lead to fabric degradation and abrasion over time. However, WONDERTOOL\u2122's ozone washing method reduces the use of chemicals and lowers the water temperature. As a result, it has been observed that fabric degradation is reduced by more than 50%, making it a gentler and more fabric-friendly laundry solution.",
      "Clothes can sometimes absorb unpleasant odors even if they are not visibly soiled. This can happen with odors like cigarette smoke, sweat, or lingering perfume traces. In such cases, washing the clothes may not be necessary, but removing the absorbed odor and eliminating viruses and harmful bacteria is essential. WONDERTOOL\u2122 offers a convenient solution that saves both time and money compared to traditional dry cleaning. Simply place the clothes in a plastic bag and use a silicone hose from WONDERTOOL\u2122 to introduce dry OZONE, effectively refreshing and sanitizing the garments.",
      "WONDERTOOL\u2122 serves as an excellent solution for dry cleaning and eliminating unpleasant odors such as sweat and tobacco from a variety of items, including clothing, shoes, children's fabric toys, and pillows. Pathogenic microbes and viruses can linger on harder-to-disinfect surfaces for up to 24 hours, and in some cases, even up to 2-3 days. Fortunately, WONDERTOOL\u2122 is equipped to remove 99% of known pathogenic microbes and viruses effectively. Simply place the soiled items inside (without water) and set the timer for 15 minutes to ensure the safety and well-being of yourself and your family.",
      "Hand-washing fruits and vegetables, while important, typically removes only about 70% of pesticides and germs. However, ozone proves highly effective at disinfecting and killing 99% of bacteria and viruses while also reducing water and energy consumption. Achieving such thorough disinfection is more challenging with traditional washing methods that rely on copious amounts of hot water and even bactericides for sterilization. WONDERTOOL\u2122 represents a superior bio-protection practice, ensuring your health by safeguarding against agro-chemicals, bacteria, and viruses, and promoting safer and more eco-friendly food preparation practices.",
      "WONDERTOOL\u2122 can effectively and gently cleanse fruits, berries, vegetables, and salad greens to a remarkable 99% level of purity in just a few minutes.",
      "Ozone has gained approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an antimicrobial agent as early as 2001. It has since been employed to combat both bacteria and chemical residues, making it a recognized and valuable tool in various applications, including food safety and hygiene.",
      "WONDERTOOL\u2122 can generate ozone-infused water for household cleaning purposes, effectively eradicating germs, bacteria, and viruses. Ozone produces a secondary oxidant, hydroxyl radicals, in the water, which is both more potent and less selective. These resulting free radicals, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hydroxyl (OH), possess significantly higher oxidation potential than ozone itself, necessitating even shorter contact times of ozonated water with bacteria and viruses for complete destruction. It's important to note that freshly prepared water must be used, as ozone rapidly reverts to its normal oxygen state. This approach stands as the most effective means to ensure uncompromised cleanliness in your home, and it cannot be achieved without ozone-saturated water with hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl from WONDERTOOL\u2122.",
      "WONDERTOOL\u2122 offers the capability to sterilize a wide range of items, including children's toys, kitchen utensils, and personal hygiene products. However, it's important to note that prolonged and repeated exposure to ozone can have a deteriorating effect on rubber products. When was the last time you cleaned your razor, toothbrush, or makeup brush? With WONDERTOOL\u2122, you can now restore them all to their original sterile cleanliness. Additionally, the ozonated water produced can be highly beneficial for watering houseplants, helping to safeguard them from fungi and harmful microbes.",
      "WONDERTOOL\u2122 not only cleans the air inside your home but also effectively eradicates 99% of microbes and viruses. It is particularly successful at eliminating unpleasant odors like cigarette smoke and mold. It's important to note that during the air purification process, neither people nor animals should be present in the room, and proper ventilation is required afterward. Many of us are familiar with the clean, fresh air that follows a thunder and lightning storm, and this is often attributed to ozone. WONDERTOOL\u2122 can bring this wonderful natural effect into your home, enhancing the quality of the air you breathe.",
      "WONDERTOOL\u2122 can easily be connected to any home outlet with a voltage range of 110-240 volts. It operates in manual mode, where you use the on/off switch and timer for control. The specific washing time and the amount of load should be determined through testing and based on your preferences. Typically, a 20-minute cycle for washing followed by a 10-minute rinse cycle is sufficient. It's a straightforward and dependable process.",
      "WONDERTOOL\u2122 is engineered to run continuously, 24 hours a day, with 15-minute breaks scheduled every 60 minutes. This extended operation time allows for thorough air purification in your home, car, or boat, effectively removing foreign odors and infections. The result is improved air quality indoors, free from allergens, germs, and dust, leading to an enhanced quality of life. It's important to keep in mind that during the air purification process, neither people nor animals should be in the room, and adequate ventilation is required afterward to ensure the safety and comfort of occupants.",
      "WONDERTOOL\u2122 is an essential tool for cleaning the interior of your car, not only from odors but also from potentially harmful bacteria and viruses that can circulate through car air conditioning systems. This can be achieved with just 30-minute treatments of the passenger compartment using ozonized air while the ventilation system is running. It's an efficient and effective way to maintain a clean and healthy car interior environment.",
      "WONDERTOOL\u2122 is a versatile and effective tool, but it's essential to handle ozone with caution, as it can be dangerous when mishandled. Ozone is a potent oxidizer that is generally safe for humans and mammals at low concentrations but highly effective against microorganisms like bacteria. It's crucial to respect ozone's oxidative capabilities and use it appropriately.",
      "We have meticulously tested and selected the ozone generator's power to ensure that it fully dissolves in water during the process. However, some ozone may still be released into the environment. Therefore, it's important to use WONDERTOOL\u2122 in well-ventilated spaces and avoid prolonged exposure to the room while it is in operation. Ozone will rapidly convert back to harmless oxygen once its job is done.",
      "Ozone is widely used in various applications, including swimming pools, hospitals, and hotels, for water disinfection and air purification. It is also effective in cleaning industrial and domestic laundries, reducing pollution, and minimizing the use of chemical detergents. Ozone has received approval from reputable agencies such as the FDA, USDA, and the EPA for its antimicrobial disinfectant properties.",
      "WONDERTOOL\u2122 is not huge (15\"13\"15\"), but to protect the product we must package it well.",
