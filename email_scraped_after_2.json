      "If you love chess, you enjoy the little details of a well-crafted physical set, like the beautiful weighted pieces and natural wood details.",
      "Online chess is definitely convenient and offers possibilities that a physical board just can't. However, playing on a screen will never give you the same experience, and it completely diminishes the beauty of the game.",
      "We bring you the best of both worlds: the infinite possibilities of online chess and the enriching experience of a physical set.",
      "Introducing Phantom. The most advanced chess board in the world.",
      "Phantom is elegantly crafted in natural wood, with the attention to detail chess deserves. But what really makes it extraordinary is inside.",

      "Whether it is someone on the other side of the world or a friend or family member you haven\u2019t been able to see for a year, Phantom brings you together.",
      "When you play against someone online, their moves happen in real-time on your board as if they were in the same room. And they don't even need to have a Phantom. They can play with you using their smartphone or computer, but if they use their own Phantom board, the experience becomes magical, as your moves reflect in their board in real time, too.",
      "Direct your troops in battle with fast, responsive voice commands. Like coming out of a magic story, the pieces move autonomously as if enchanted. Marvel anyone by playing a hands-free chess game.",
      "Computers have brought new life to the ancient game of chess. It was once thought impossible that a machine would be able to beat a Grand Master human player. But now, computers have become so good that trying to compete against them is a futile endeavor.",
      "Phantom allows you to play against Maia, a human-like neural network chess engine, specifically designed to mimic human play. It automatically adapts to your rank and always presents you the most challenging and enjoyable game.",

      "Expert players are renowned for their graceful moves. Precise. Without hesitations.",

      "We wanted to recover the human touch and mimic real movements as much as possible to provide the most enjoyable automated chess experience.",
      "Phantom's beautiful pieces glide flawlessly over the board. And while you won\u2019t be able to play blitz with it, the moves are fast and precise. It feels natural as if you are playing with another person.",
      "Through obsessive attention to detail, we custom-built every aspect of our chess board and pieces to feel like the most authentic set you have ever owned.",
      "The natural wooden board brings a timeless aesthetic. The chessmen are weighted and precisely balanced. We carefully curated the right material for the base of each piece, one that provides low friction for smooth autonomous motion, but doesn\u2019t change the feeling of playing chess.",
      "An autonomous board posed a unique design challenge. Because all the pieces must be able to travel between any other two, typical wide-base chess piece design would mean tiny pieces like those from a dollar store.",
      "We solved the problem and designed chess pieces that look and feel premium without being too bulky for the digitally enabled wooden board.",
      "Phantom brings you an unparalleled experience. Pieces moving naturally and gracefully. The whisper-quiet mechanism lets you enjoy the game without distractions.",

      "We want to enable a deeper enjoyment of chess by allowing anyone to communicate with the Phantom Board using our Open Source Protocol. This means that anyone who wants to support our board will be able to do so. Tinkerers and hobbyists can use the board as a platform for any project they can imagine.",

      "We are a team of experienced engineers and product designers with a huge passion for building robots, and we have dedicated the past 18 months to Phantom.",
      "It has taken a lot of mechanical and electronic engineering to create a system that moves flawlessly with uttermost precision and runs for years without issues. We\u2019ve invested hours testing our mechanisms and reviewing every last detail.",

      "We are taking the following steps to minimize the most common issues IndieGoGo campaigns face:",
      "First of all, we are working with established suppliers. We have previously worked with our manufacturers and have created positive relationships with them. We have been developing and prototyping Phantom with their feedback since the beginning to ensure it is manufacturable and scalable.",
      "Secondly, we have set our timeline carefully. Many campaigns are over-optimistic, so when the time comes, they can\u2019t deliver in the promised timeline. We have taken the necessary steps to create a solid timeline and provide enough room to do everything we need to make sure we deliver an outstanding product.",
      "And lastly, communication is the most important thing between creators and backers. That\u2019s why we will post regular updates so you can see exactly what is happening in Phantom's development. In the event that something goes wrong, we will always keep you updated with both the reason for the issues and what steps are we taking to solve them.",
      "We look forward to partnering with you to bring Phantom to the world!",
      "This project collocates surveys by PledgeBox, the Pledge Management system helped thousands of creators to be more successful with more sales and satisfied millions of backers.",

      "\"I'm very impressed with this device. I have to admit that when I first tried it, I thought that it was a bit of gimmick and that it would never work, especially as I have quite a large correction (over 9 diopter - enough to make the \"keep the other eye focused on a distant object a bit of a joke). Despite struggling at times to see the test lines, I ended up with a result that was only fractionally different from my \"official\" prescription from my ophthalmologist and his roomful of shiny machines. And that's only after two runs. So full marks. Excellent gadget\" -- Rexforr, Kickstarter backer",
      "\"Got mine yesterday. Taken numerous readings over the past 24 hours (iPhone 6S) and they all come out *very* close to my own prescription, which is now a year old. Very impressed! Will order some glasses with the EyeQue prescription and see how they work out.\"--Mark Harding, Kickstarter backer",
      "\u201cMy eye exams each year show I have perfect vision, but I\u2019ve been getting headaches in the afternoons. EyeQue revealed that during stressful projects at work, my eyesight is strained. With some simple computer glasses, I\u2019ve reduced the strain, eliminated the headaches and still have perfect vision\u2026most of the time!\u201d -- Gloria",
      "\u201cThank you EyeQue! My eyes have been so tired lately. I made an appointment with my eye doctor but it is 6 weeks away. I was able to get an EyeQue miniscope, take a few tests and my new glasses just arrived!\" -- Anna",
      "\u201cI take pretty good care of myself, see dentists twice a year, doctor\u2019s annually and make sure to see the optometrist every other year. EyeQue allows me to track changes in my eyesight in between office visits. If something changes before my regular appointment, I\u2019ll be sure to get to the doctor sooner.\u201d -- Will",

      "What is a customs duty and why do I have to pay for it? Customs duty is a tariff or tax imposed on imported goods. If you live outside of the US, you may be subject to it, since we are shipping all packages from California. We do not charge the customs duty; your country does. As we try our best to minimize that cost for our customers, we cannot be responsible for it.",
      "Does this work for everyone? The Personal Vision Tracker works for most people. Some users have trouble using it due to accommodation (eyes' focusing abilities) which is common amongst young adults (under 25 years of age). This product works better for those over 30 years of age.",
      "How accurate are the results? The PVT (Personal Vision Tracker) is a self-administered test and results will depend on how well the test was taken by the user-- make sure you watch the tutorial video! For certain people with various health conditions the device will not give accurate results. We do not recommend the PVT for anyone with known medical conditions associated with vision, such as cataract, glaucoma, keratoconus, and etc.",
      "Are the EyeGlass Numbers same as a prescription? No.",
      "Is the EyeQue Personal Vision Tracker approved by the FDA? The PVT is registered as a class 1 medical device in the US with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).",
      "Is the EyeQue Personal Vision Tracker approved by the FDA equivalent in my country? We are currently pursing but are NOT registered with any regulatory agencies outside the US, so the user uses this at their own risk.",
      "Will the myEyeQue App work in my country? The myEyeQue app has been rigorously tested in three supported countries: the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Our app has also been used in many other countries around the world. While we don't officially support operation of the PVT in other countries at this time, we have not received any complaints of the app not working properly.",
      "Can I use it for contact lenses? You can use the EyeQue Personal Vision Tracker to check the effectiveness of your contact lenses by taking an EyeQue vision test while wearing them. The results from the Personal Vision Tracker should not be used to purchase contact lenses.",
      "My shipment to UK did not have customs duty prepaid? We were offered erroneous information when we quoted our Indiegogo backers that we can prepay customs duty to the UK. Unfortunately that is not something we can do, and we apologize. But we do intend on keeping our words-- Please kindly email us your receipt, and we will refund your customs duty charges (this is for orders up to April 25, 2017).",

      "The Sandwizz\u00ae Breadboard starting point. We launched our company in February with the primary goal of creating the Sandwizz\u00ae Breadboard and developing intelligent software for it. We have a patent pending on the process combined with the Breadboard hardware, that allows us to take netlist files and upload them into this intelligent Breadboard, which then instructs users on where to place components. This innovative feature has generated significant interest.",
      "We have listened to the market. We have engaged with various stakeholders and identified a segment that includes those developing embedded software for electronic products. They expressed a need for the ability to program the Breadboard themselves, leveraging all its features. Therefore, while we will continue with our original approach of providing built-in intelligent software that assists with component placement, guidance, and checks, we are also opening up additional possibilities as described.",
      "Project Delivery and Included Schematics. We are happy to announce that when we deliver the product, we will also include the necessary schematics for our users. This means you will be able to use the Sandwizz\u00ae Breadboard and its accompanying components, such as Arduino and library cards, as a development platform for microcontrollers, PLD design, USB, and many other applications. Our focus is on PSoC 5, but you can naturally port the code to another MCU/hardware device afterwards, as long as it has the same or similar features as the PSoC 5/Sandwizz\u00ae device.",
      "Versatile Development Platform. The Sandwizz\u00ae Breadboard provides a versatile solution where you can start your project on PSoC 5 and later transfer it to the processor you wish to use. This more open concept with PSoC gives you much greater flexibility to implement specific details you desire. This is our counter to those who want the product to be open source. While we do not wish to make it open source, we give users the ability to use it as a hardware platform for embedded software development, leveraging the existing software made for PSoC 5 by Infineon and others.",
      "Patent Pending and Licensing. We have a patent pending on the Sandwizz\u00ae Breadboard concept. When you purchase a Sandwizz\u00ae board produced by Microaware\u00ae, a license to use it is included, allowing you to write your own code for it. We retain full copyright on the schematic and associated product layout, and we have a patent pending on several elements that make it the Sandwizz\u00ae Breadboard. The license granted with the purchase of the Sandwizz\u00ae Breadboard follows the product, meaning you can create new products of a different nature using the board. However, you do not have the right to create and sell a similar concept as a development platform like the Sandwizz\u00ae Breadboard. The products created should be of a different character.",
      "Porting from PSoC 5 to Other Processors. Once you have developed an early prototype on the breadboard, it will not be difficult to port from PSoC 5 to another desired processor and architecture. This makes the Sandwizz\u00ae Breadboard an excellent starting point, and later, as the project progresses to a more advanced prototype stage, you can transfer the developed elements to the chosen architecture.",
      "Proof of Concept and Field Testing. The early prototypes with Sandwizz\u00ae can serve as a Proof of Concept, and if you transfer this design to the Sandwizz\u00ae Protoboard solution, you can conduct initial field tests of the device to be produced later and gather valuable insights for the continued project development. There will even be some extent of hardware modifications possible on the protoboard, by firmware upgrade, as long as they can be made with the internal components in PSoC 5 and its internal routing capabilities.",
      "Using PSoC Creator IDE. You will have the opportunity to use PSoC Creator, which is Infineon's (formerly Cypress) IDE. This IDE provides extensive capabilities to work with all the detailed technical aspects of the Sandwizz\u00ae Breadboard.",
      "Schematics and Documentation. It is important to note that the schematics we provide are \"as is.\" There will be no additional documentation from our side, and users must refer to Infineon's documentation. If support questions arise, they should be directed to Infineon, as you are working with their PSoC 5 connected to our electronics.",
      "Debugging Made Easy. We have also made debugging easy. By using a debugger and programming device such as MiniProg3 or MiniProg4 from Infineon, you can easily access programming and debugging of the PSoC 5 chip via the connections we have for cascading multiple breadboards. The only thing you need to get started is a debugger or programming device.",
      "Appeal to Embedded Software Developers. This also means that our product now caters more to those who write embedded software. For those who may not be familiar with using a soldering iron and setting up hardware, this breadboard allows you to simply insert components. This can be done using a schematic created by another person, making it much easier for those working with embedded software to create something with this breadboard.",
      "Broadening the Appeal. By opening up the product in this way, the Sandwizz\u00ae Breadboard now has greater appeal to hobbyists, students, or professionals working in embedded software or hardware development. It can be an excellent platform for creating projects, including graduation or semester projects where you need to build something and demonstrate it. This platform allows you to quickly develop various applications, such as robotic controls and more.",

      "By Co-funder Tommy Nielsen",
      "Inspiration and Start. My need for something like the Sandwizz\u00ae Breadboard started many years ago. For 32 years in my professional career as an electronic engineer and 10 years before that as an electronics maker, I focused on making things easier and frequently worked on new inventions. My experience taught me the importance of quickly creating mockups to illustrate the concept behind an idea. Drawings, schematics, and 3D CAD models on the computer screen often weren't sufficient to convey ideas to others. Therefore, it became crucial to create something tangible quickly to test and refine the idea. Life has taught me the importance of failing fast and learning by doing. This doesn't mean I don't enjoy studying theory and engaging in deep creative thoughts, but it's only when we try out these theories and ideas that we truly understand them. At the same time, we also discover what's missing in our mindset.",
      "My Summer vacation in Spain 2023. I did enjoy the good food and the nice sun, but my mind was with the Sandwizz Breadboard a lot.",
      "Early Experiments. Between 2015 and 2018, I was involved in developing a new product through an innovation and technological phase in my previous job. It reminded me again of the importance of tools for quick mockup creation, which we partly lacked at that time. In early 2019, while organizing my workshop at home, I found an old yellowed breadboard from my student days and became inspired. Holding this breadboard in one hand and a modern development board in the other, I envisioned the Sandwizz\u00ae Breadboard: a contemporary breadboard with integrated components and intelligence for both analog and digital connections.",
      "The 35-year-old breadboard from my student days. Besides being yellowed, nothing has really changed in breadboards in all that time.",
      "Experimental Mockup. In early 2021, I began researching breadboards that were easier to solder. After some experiments, I ordered a prototype breadboard and built a mockup to illustrate the concept. Even with all the wires that are so typical of a traditional  breadboard mockup, the prototype demonstrated that signals could be effectively routed to specific components and connections.",
      "The first mockup of the Sandwizz Breadboard concept was created using a traditional breadboard, the new solderable breadboard modules, a protoboard, and a couple of evaluation kits for the system-on-chip that I wanted to use. It's a great example of how to use existing tools to create the next generation of a tool in the same category.",
      "Initiating Sandwizz\u00ae Breadboard. After a busy period at work, the idea resurfaced in January 2023. Inspired by what I would have wanted as a young engineer and by the goal of helping the younger generation, the Sandwizz\u00ae Breadboard was developed. I worked many hours after work, creating the first real version of the Sandwizz\u00ae Breadboard. I took a course on Udemy to learn about the KiCad E-CAD software, as I saw it as the perfect choice for a first platform that would be part of the Sandwizz\u00ae concept. Additionally, I wanted to refresh my skills in schematics and PCB layout from my earlier days, as I would need those updated skills to create the Sandwizz\u00ae Breadboard. This way, I also took my own medicine, the one I would prescribe as a first choice for those working with the concept in the future.",

      "The Sandwizz\u00ae Breadboard has undergone several iterations. Not only has the color changed, but elements have also been added to ensure a higher robustness in the design.",
      "Testing the Idea, and Finding a Co-Founder. My close and most trusted colleagues and friends confirmed the value of the idea, and in the summer of 2023, I shared the concept with Ren\u00e9. He immediately recognized its potential and became the co-founder of Microaware\u00ae. Together, we worked hard on the business plan for Microaware, and in late autumn 2023, we signed the agreement for our new joint company. I would work full-time, and Ren\u00e9 would be the advisor in his spare time. We quickly concluded that Kickstarter would be the perfect platform to launch our Sandwizz\u00ae Breadboard concept. It is a platform frequently visited by the younger generation, which is also our target audience, including DIY makers and students. Furthermore, it is an international platform, which Sandwizz\u00ae needs to grow, as the Danish domestic market, although sizable, could easily become too niche-focused for such a product.",
      "Ren\u00e9 and Tommy shake hands after signing the contract to found Microaware.",
      "Business Establishment and Development. Microaware\u00ae was officially established on February 1st, with a hardware release candidate for the Sandwizz\u00ae Breadboard ready for testing. While the product's hardware needed testing for robustness, the firmware was still under development. Throughout the Kickstarter campaign and beyond, we planned to optimize the algorithm for accurate component placement to ensure seamless implementation once the hardware is fully produced.",
      "The release candidate of the Sandwizz Breadboard hardware. Here, an application is demonstrated with a Class B amplifier, including an LED VU meter, test tone generator, volume potentiometer, and USB stream interface for music.",
      "Presentation and Future Plans. Despite being just a two-person team, our combined experience in business management, innovation, and electronics design has enabled us to create the Sandwizz\u00ae Breadboard from a home office. Even before the official launch of the company, we dedicated countless hours to developing the business and the concept, investing much more time than one might expect for a company that officially began in February 2024. The product was presented at Embedded World 2024 in Nuremberg, where it attracted considerable interest. With Kickstarter, we aim to reach a broader audience that can recognize the potential for more efficient electronics development. We believe that once the right people see the Sandwizz\u00ae Breadboard, they'll appreciate how it can effectively transform ideas into practice.",

      "Here\u2019s something you didn\u2019t know\u2014lab tests have proven that aqueous ozone water eliminates 99.9% of common pathogens in just 1 minute.",
      "This is why ozonated water is used in hospitals, commercial kitchens, and meat counters to clean and disinfect equipment and produce.",
      "Now, you can harness the power of ozone-infused water in your home! Say goodbye to chemical-overloaded cleaning supplies and that ultrasonic thingamajing that cleans your produce.",
      "Shield O\u2122 turns ordinary tap water into aqueous ozone which helps you disinfect and deodorize everything you wash without any chemical residue or that horrible strong smell.",
      "Want to know what aqueous ozone water smells like? It smells like the air after a thunderstorm.",
      "Are you aware that alcohol-based sanitizers can contribute to dry skin, infections, alcohol poisoning, and release substantial amounts of formaldehyde and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), thereby polluting indoor air? With Shield O, these concerns are eliminated.",
      "Shield O was created with your safety in mind. Here are answers to some commonly-asked questions about safety.",
      "Is ozonated water safe to drink?",
      "Yes, ozonated water is safe to drink. Some people even claim it has health benefits. However, we do not have research to back up those claims, so we recommend using ozonated water primarily for sanitation purposes.",
      "Is it safe to plug in an electrical device close to a water source?",
      "According to standard electrical codes, any power outlet installed within 6 feet of a water source should be GFCIs. Please make sure the outlet you use is equipped with GFCI before using this product.",
      "Does it remove fluoride?",
      "To clarify, Shield O is designed to generate aqueous ozone/activated oxygen water instantly and on demand. This process involves generating and dissolving ozone in water, creating a solution that is safe for human use but deadly to microorganisms. When ozone is dissolved in water, it becomes an effective oxidizer that can break down and inactivate pesticide and organic contaminants, including bacteria, viruses, and other harmful microorganisms. However, fluoride is highly stable and negatively charged, and it is not easily removed by oxidation. Therefore, the device is ineffective in removing fluoride from water.",
      "Disclaimer: This device can NOT be used to diagnose, cure, treat, or prevent any disease. Aqueous Ozone has to be generated and used on-site. It can NOT be stored or transported.",
      "When you turn on the faucet, Shield O\u2122 works its magic by generating ozone and dissolving it in water. The result is aqueous ozone, which is safe for humans but highly effective against nasty microorganisms. Aqueous ozone acts like a superhero oxidizer, breaking down pesticides and getting rid of organic contaminants like bacteria and viruses.",
      "What is aqueous ozone anyway? Well, it's very similar to when you mix 1 part chlorine with 6 parts water to create a cleaning solution. Only in this case, we add ozone (O3) and let it dissolve in water to make aqueous ozone.",
      "With Shield O\u2122, we use an electrical discharge on the oxygen in the surrounding air. This process energizes oxygen (O2) so it combines with another oxygen molecule, turning into ozone (made up of three oxygen atoms - O3). Ozone is a powerhouse molecule - it\u2019s super reactive and a strong oxidizing agent. It can bust into cells, attack their membranes, disable enzymes, and even break down the genetic materials of gDNA and total RNA. But here's the best part: after it's done its job of fighting microorganisms, ozone turns back into oxygen and leaves no yucky residue behind.",
      "Because ozone is pretty unstable, aqueous ozone starts breaking down as soon as it's created. It stays effective for around 15 minutes before it transforms back into normal water and oxygen. That\u2019s why it can only be generated and used on-site and you won\u2019t find it stored in a bottle at the pharmacy or grocery store.",

      "\"This preliminary study helps confirm that ozonated water possesses excellent antimicrobial properties and should have a place in effective hand hygiene protocols. The addition of ozonated water to the handwashing regimen is recommended by the authors, as it has proven to be of value in reducing ATP levels on the skin following this preliminary study. Further studies are needed to issue additional recommendations.\"",
      "The FDA has designated aqueous ozone as GRAS (generally recognized as safe) for use as an antimicrobial agent in direct contact with food for human consumption, and the USDA permits its use as an ingredient in the organic food program. In fact, the bottled water industry recognizes it as a Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and it is widely used in commercial settings such as hospitals and meat counters. Learn more about this FDA classification.",
      "Shield O\u2122 was designed to be small and compact in order to bring the well-known benefits of aqueous ozone into the home. View the Shield O\u2122 FDA listing.",
      "In order to ensure Shield O\u2122 is as effective as possible, we conducted third-party testing through SGS. We tested against a variety of harmful bacteria and pathogens including Coliform, Esherichia coli, Staphylococcus aures, Pseudomonas Aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Legionella pheumophila, and MRSA. The study showed that after just 60 seconds of contact, the ozone water generated through Shield O\u2122 eliminated 99.9% of test pathogens.",
      "We also wanted to see how Shield O\u2122 performs when it comes to removing pesticide residues. So, we took a sample vegetable and tested it for 214 different pesticides. We found residues of Chlorpyrifos, Dimethomorph, Pencycuron, and Quinoxyfen. After submerging and washing the sample vegetable with ozone water generated with Shield O\u2122 for 3 minutes, 99.9% of the pesticide residues were eliminated.",
      "We are proud to partner with Indiegogo so we can launch our product with the help of a community. The revenue we generate here makes it possible for us to continue developing products without seeking outside funding.",

      "A safe, comfortable motorcycle shoe combining electronics, abrasion resistance and impact protection",
      "The world\u2019s most comfortable, stylish, and technologically advanced pair of motorcycle shoes. ROAME Zeros' have seamlessly integrated turn signal and brake light technology which wirelessly connect to your motorcycle.",
      "Motorcycle shoes should be safe, but they shouldn\u2019t have to be uncomfortable, bulky, inconvenient, and unfashionable.",
      "We\u2019ve spent the last three years designing the ultimate motorcycle shoe, so you can ride safely without giving up comfort and style. The ROAME Zeros are designed to be a motorcycle shoe that fits into your everyday life.",
      "By using the newest technology for impact protection, integrating electronics for enhanced rider visibility, and re-thinking the way shoes are made, the ROAME Zeros are everything a motorcycle shoe should be.",
      "The ROAME Zeros are a fusion of safety and fashion. An emphasis on a casual look, increased comfort, and hidden technology set the Zeros apart from all motorcycle shoes that have come before it.",
      "The fact that most of the safety features are hidden was one of the reasons why we called this shoe the \u201cZeros\u201d. When it comes to developing our product, we made Zero compromises. Finally, total freedom! You don\u2019t have to choose between safety and comfort anymore.",
      "We feel you should be able to be free of constraints when it comes to motorcycle footwear. The Zeros are a high top shoe that blurs the lines between performance and casual wear. These lightweight shoes are designed for all-day riding, comfort, and performance without cutting corners.",
      "The longer you ride, the more you realize the importance of motorcycle gear. Certainly our helmets, jackets, boots and gloves have become far more than just safety gear, but a part of our motorcycle lifestyle. Where does it say that motorcycle gear has to be inconvenient and unstylish? The ROAME Zeros are here to redefine what motorcycle safety should look like.",
      "With the ROAME Zeros we wanted to create a shoe that would offer motorcycle safety while complementing your lifestyle. Remember, it\u2019s not if you\u2019ll crash but when. If you ride long enough, you will go down. You need make sure you\u2019re wearing the right gear to protect yourself when this happens.",
      "First, add our small transmitter box to your motorcycle's existing turn signal/brake light system, then pair the shoes with this box. Once the shoes have been paired with this transmitter box, all you have to do is get on your bike and start riding. ROAME takes care of the rest.",
      "It\u2019s hard hard to see motorcycles because they have less mass than 4 wheel vehicles and therefore have a smaller road presence. Drivers notice an absence of cars, not the presence of a motorcycle. Motorcycles are roughly 1/6th the size of a 4-door sedan. That translates to a significant reduction in visibility.",
      "Whether you are riding to work, school, bike night, or just a casual ride to meet friends for lunch, the ROAME Zeros will be there to help you stay safe, looking good, and keeping you comfortable.",
      "Have you ever a stored a pair of comfortable shoes to change into at school or work? ROAME Zeros is your solution.",
      "We are almost lined up for first-run production, but we need help to get this off the ground. With the money we raise on Indiegogo, we will finalize the electronics, get FCC approval, and place our first order.",
      "From there, the sky\u2019s the limit. If this campaign is a success, we hope to quickly expand our product offering and add more new designs to our collection, as we continue to make motorcycle safety comfortable and stylish.",
      "Growing up with motorcycles, Adam spent every possible moment on 2 wheels. When he started riding on the street in 2007, he quickly noticed a big problem. Motorcycle shoes were bulky, uncomfortable, and there was a great need on the road to be seen by other vehicles. This was the motivation over the last three years to bring the ROAME Zeros from concept to reality.",

Audio recordings will be automatically deleted after 30 days or according to the settings adjusted by the user. You can override audio deletion by using a \"Keep Audio\" function.",
      "Our journey began with one challenge and one objective: Capture any fleeting thought or conversation without breaking stride or flow. And how to do it faster than any existing technology. We contemplated size, shape, battery life, but most importantly ease of use. A single button to start and stop recording and a lock to prevent pocket dials. Everyone should be able to use this without investing in learning. It needed to be familiar and have features that gives the user feedback. Integrating AI was the breakthrough we needed, transforming CRUSH from a simple recorder into an intelligent assistant. We redesigned from the ground up three times all of the as we learned about all of the use cases that evolved.",
      "Developing CRUSH has not been easy. Hardware is notoriously difficult, and the iOS, Android, and Web app added layers of complexity. Getting everything to talk reliably is not easy. We have had to overcome hard engineering problems, learn new skills, and rewrite the entire codebase from scratch when we learned into what CRUSH would become and who would be using it. There is a reason why CRUSH has not existed before, it's complex and expensive. That only encouraged us.",
      "With CRUSH, you can capture every crucial conversation, every midnight epiphany effortlessly. But what comes next is where the magic happens. Need a summary of a lengthy meeting?

    "allParagraphs": [
      "One of the oldest and healthiest cooking techniques - Stone Cooking returns to our kitchens.",
      "We wanted to make one of the oldest and healthiest cooking techniques - stone cooking - accessible to everyone. So, we created a stone pan with a little modern twist so it could be used anywhere and everywhere - from the heaters to straight on the dining table.",
      "Healthy cooking. Delicious food. Long lasting. Retains heat. Eco-friendly materials. Good presentation. Even better price.",
      "These days, in this fast-paced world, we are always in such a rush. Barely ever do we take the time to ourselves. From high-speed Internet, to fast food, to high-demand everything - we are always rushing through life when we really should be slowing down and enjoying it.",
      "So we, a group of food enthusiasts, teamed up with some of the best chefs in the world to create something that would help solve this problem of rushing. Something that would be your tool in healthy eating. Something that would allow you to use an ancient cooking method at home. Something that would bring the family together. Something that would impress your guests at your next backyard barbeque party. Something that would bring out your inner Betty Crocker even if you\u2019re the worst chef in the world. And most importantly - something that would help you wind down and truly enjoy the food and company surrounding you.",
      "That something is Piedra Cocinar. A stone pan that takes us back to our roots and reminds us to slow down sometimes.",
      "Now, we know what you are thinking\u2026 What? Another cooking pan? Don\u2019t we have enough of those on the market?",
      "Well, this one is different. Isn\u2019t that what they all say, though? But seriously. This pan takes us way back to our roots. 2000 years back. And reminds us to wind down, take our time, and enjoy the moment.",
      "Inspired by Mediterranean cooking and the Mediterranean lifestyle, we believe that every person should take the time to de-stress, slow down, and truly enjoy a home-cooked meal. Whether that would be every day or just once a week - Piedra Cocinar invites you to do that by helping you cook something truly special and keeping it warm for a long time.",
      "It is well known that the Mediterranean diet is perhaps one of the healthiest diets in the world. From fighting inflammation, to reducing the risk for heart attack, stroke & Alzheimer\u2019s disease, to encouraging healthy weight loss, to improving skin health - eating like a Mediterranean has been associated with endless health benefits.",
      "Which is why we teamed up with the well-known chefs and Mediterranean food experts to bring the Piedra Cocinar project to life. Born in the small Spanish towns they continue their family cooking traditions that have been passed on generation to generation for hundreds of years. And their grandparents are living proof of the benefits of eating like a Mediterranean!",
      "Mediterranean chef Santiago  - \u2018\u2019Yes, my grandma is over one hundred years old. She is still in good health and she is a very independent lady. And she still cooks daily. And what is most important - every time we sit around the table for a family dinner, she impresses us with something new. New aroma, new taste,\u2019\u2019 he smiles. \u2018\u2019Most people in our towns can expect to live longer, much longer than the World\u2019s average\u2019\u2019.",
      "Don\u2019t get confused here. The Piedra Cocinar pan is not just another cast iron skillet or non-stick pan. It is something completely different. It\u2019s the thing you knew in the back of your head that your kitchen was missing. And once you try it, you won\u2019t know how you ever lived without it!",
      "Unlike most pans and baking dishes, Piedra Cocinar is created with gabbro diabase (black marble) rather than metal or glass. Due to the thermal mass of the rock and the material's property food is less likely to burn on it.",
      "Not to mention, for the first time in history, our Piedra Cocinar stone pans can be used anywhere and everywhere. It\u2019s stone cooking taken to another level! The only exception - microwaves. But microwaves aren\u2019t good for you anyway, so it\u2019s a win-win.",
      "Even though we would love to take all the credit, we can\u2019t. We didn\u2019t invent stone cooking - our ancestors did. All we did was make it accessible to everyone by creating a stone pan that can be used in any modern kitchen. And, we don\u2019t want to brag, but we think it\u2019s pretty awesome and our ancestors would be proud.",
      "That pretty much says it all. You know, if it was created by chefs - it has to be good.",
      "We are a team of Spanish and UK engineers, chefs, and food lovers. By combining all of our knowledge, we have designed a range of kitchenware so you could become a chef too - the Piedra Cocinar way.",
      "Even if you don\u2019t know how to cook, our team of in-house chefs creates picture-perfect food recipes weekly for you to try at home.",
      "We believe that the best things come from simplicity - fire, stone, and organic groceries. You\u2019d be surprised what a delicious and healthy combination these three components make.",
      "Not to mention, you can cook absolutely anything on Piedra Cocinar kitchenware. Unlike with barbeque grills where your possibilities are limited, food does not dry out on our stone pans. They are specially created to lock in all the healthy juices within the foods.",
      "Not only will your guests be impressed with how good of a chef you are (wink, wink), but they will also be impressed by the presentation as well.",
      "Serve the food straight from a large \u201cshare la plancha\u201d or separate \u201ca piedra para cocinar\u201d for each guest.",
      "Since the stone stays warm for a while, the food will also stay hot and moist. So you can wind down, take your time, and enjoy your meal like a true Mediterranean. No rush!",
      "It\u2019s a well-known fact that overheated or scratched non-stick pans coated by PFOA or PFTE are toxic. In fact, birds die if they inhale PFTE. Humans can survive these intoxications, but the question is - do we want to? Just because we can survive doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not harmful. Just think about it - why buy expensive, organic groceries and toss them on to Perfluorooctanoic/Teflon coated pans? It doesn\u2019t make sense.",
      "We say no to artificial coatings and want to inspire you to do so too. The Piedra Cocinar kitchenware is eco-friendly, 100% recyclable, and artificial coating-free.",
      "Made from gabbro diabase stone, hardwood handles, and lots of love, the Piedra Cocinar kitchenware is completely handmade in the UK. No slavery or kids labour involved in our production run. Just lots of passion and love for high-quality kitchenware, and a lifetime guarantee!",
      "Expect these pans to be extremely long-lasting, as they are loaded with naturally-formed layers of metamorphic stone - which is composed of silt ore, shale, and volcanic ash compressed over millions of years. Not to mention, the hardwood handles are boiled in natural oils to give longevity, strength and to revive natural beauty. The result - a beautiful, eco-friendly, one-of-a-kind stone pan.",
      "Please note this product is made from natural stone and wood, therefore you will find color and pattern variations in the stone and the wood due to the way the product is made. No two items are identical. Each and every item is unique.",

      "During my time teaching I got consistently positive teaching evaluations from both students & administrators. I enjoyed teaching but was always frustrated by the limitations of the conventional college classroom format. This course will enable me to teach a topic I want to cover in-depth, exactly the way I want to, with no limitations.",
      "Over the past few years, my family & I have experienced & worked to overcome multiple significant hardships, including my own battles with addiction & depression, followed by my wife having to undergo multiple spinal surgeries that resulted in her being permanently physically disabled and having to leave her career.",
      "While I've (thankfully) been able to overcome my mental health issues well enough to bounce back & be there to support my wife as she's gone through this painful transition, our finances have become severely strained due to the loss of my wife's income & all of the medical bills and other debts we've accumulated in the last couple of years, and getting through the last bit of 2024 is proving to be extremely challenging.",
      "This fundraising campaign will literally keep a roof over my family's head, and in return will offer contributors something that I have been wanting to do for a long time: teaching a Dangerous History course about an extremely important, relevant & timely topic exactly how I want to teach it, with no limitations being imposed by institutions.",
      "The Decline & Fall of the Soviet Empire is one of the most important historical stories of the last several centuries and is a topic one must understand in order to make sense of the world as it currently exists today.",
      "I believe that if more Americans understood the true story of this historical turning point, they would have a much better understanding of current world events, and a better idea of what to expect as the American Empire continues on its own path of decline & fall.",
      "I will teach an online course which will cover the decline of the Soviet Empire beginning in the 1950s with the death of Josef Stalin & the reforms of Nikita Khruschev, continuing through the 1970s with the stagnation of the Brezhnev era, the accession to power & reforms of Mikhail Gorbachev, the final collapse in the late-1980s/early-1990s, & the deterioration of Russo-American relations in the 21st century.",
      "This course will be taught online via Zoom. It will consist of 4 sessions on Tuesday nights at 8pm Eastern (see dates posted above.) In each session, CJ will lecture for approximately 90-100 minutes and then answer students' questions. (Sessions will be recorded & shared with students so you can watch the recordings if you have to miss any live sessions, of if you simply want to rewatch any of them.)",
      "A brief outline of what each session will entail:",
      "Session 1: Khrushchev to Brezhnev (1953-1964) \u2013 This session will begin in the aftermath of the death of Stalin & the accession to power of Nikita Khrushchev. It will discuss Khrushchev\u2019s partial rejection of Stalin\u2019s legacy & his \u201cthaw\u201d & \u201cde-Stalinization\u201d reforms. It will also cover some of the main events of Khrushchev\u2019s reign as Soviet premier, including the repression of the Hungarian Uprising of 1956, the 1960 U-2 Crisis, the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, and Khruschev\u2019s removal of power & replacement by Leonid Brezhnev in 1964.",
      "Session 2: Brezhnev to Gorbachev (1964-1985) \u2013 This session will cover the era of stagnation under Brezhnev, including the suppression of the \u201cPrague Spring\u201d in Czechoslovakia in 1968, d\u00e9tente with the United States in the 1970s, the end of d\u00e9tente in the late-1970s (including the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan), the election of Ronald Reagan to the Presidency of the United States, the death of Brezhnev, and continued problems in the Soviet Union & the Warsaw Pact states under his short-lived successors Yuri Andropov & Konstantin Chernenko.",
      "Session 3: Crisis & Collapse (1985-1991) \u2013 This session will pick up with the accession to power of Mikhail Gorbachev, and his attempts to improve relations with the United States, pursue disarmament agreements, and reform the Soviet system. It will also cover how those reforms did not save the Soviet system but ultimately sped up its disintegration, & how Communism fell in the Warsaw Pact states and ultimately in the Soviet Union itself.",
      "Session 4: A Mini-Dark Age to a New Cold War (1991-present) \u2013 This session will look at how the former Eastern Bloc states fared in the aftermath of the end of Communism, showing what a wide variety of experiences there were, from relatively benign to downright catastrophic, and how Russia was one of the places that, for a variety of reasons, fared very badly. It will also mention the negative effects of American interventions in the former Soviet Union, the failures of the Yeltsin government, the coming to power of Vladimir Putin, and the ways that the United States & NATO have antagonized Russia and are largely responsible for creating the New Cold War that, unfortunately, turned hot in Ukraine.",
      "I need to raise at least $2,500 in order to make teaching the course worth my time & effort. (More would obviously be better, as I'm currently genuinely struggling to make ends meet.)",
      "Live sessions will be at 8pm US Eastern time over the course of 4 Tuesday evenings starting on 12/10. (For full schedule of all sessions, see above -- we're taking off the weeks of Christmas & New Year's.)",
      "If you purchase a live ticket for $250, you will be able to access the online course sessions live/in real-time (during which you'll be able to ask CJ questions & engage in discussions), and you will also get access to recordings of the course sessions after they have been taught.",
      "If you purchase a recordings-only ticket for $175, you will not have access to the course sessions live/in real-time as they're taught (& thus won't be able to ask questions or engage in discussion), but you will get access to recordings of all course sessions after they are taught.",
      "By contributing to this campaign & helping me be able to run this course, you'll also be helping me to keep doing the Dangerous History Podcast & other independent content-creation projects, while simultaneously avoiding homelessness & bankruptcy. ;)",
      "If you cannot afford either a live or recordings-only course ticket, you can still help me & the Dangerous History Podcast by chipping in any amount you want just as a donation (with no course access in return), and you can also help by spreading the word of this campaign to anyone you think might be interested in it.

      "It is no secret that traditional pillows retain a lot of body heat, causing some sleepers to become uncomfortably warm or hot during the night. This causes hot flashes, night sweating, restlessness, headaches, also continuous tossing and turning, insomnia, or waking up full of sweat.",
      "Traditional pillows are made of solid materials like memory foam, cotton, or latex. These materials can easily lose their support over time, leading to head or shoulder pain. They can also trap heat and moisture, creating a breeding ground for bacteria and insects.",
      "First, we need to define our purpose. What do we want to achieve with our pillow? We want our pillow to provide:",
      "Second, we need to check if the current technology can support our idea.",
      "Our team of experts did extensive research and found that the smaller the particles, the better the neck support for your head and neck.",
      "We took a big leap and applied the smallest particles we could find: water and air, into our new pillow. This revolutionary design perfectly meets all three goals: maximum support, cooling sleep, and adjustability.",

      "Unlike other so-called \"feel like 4 degrees cooler\"pillows,  our pillow actually stands the test of time. It's like an air conditioner for your head, keeping you cool and comfortable all night long. Other pillows use different easy-evaporate covers, which may help to reduce sweat a little bit, but they can't provide the same level of cooling comfort as low temperatures beneath your head.",
      "Our pillow also has a silk cooling cover, in addition to the cooling water in the pillow, to provide the best possible cooling comfort never seen on the market.",
      "Research shows that with 2\u2103 below human temperature, people have 22% more deep sleep.",
      "\"According to the research presented in 'The Temperature Dependence of Sleep', it is highlighted that 'sleep onset and the decline of core temperature occur simultaneously', and 'direct skin heating can shorten sleep latency and promote NREM sleep'. Thus, by utilizing our water pillow, which reduces the contact surface temperature by 2\u00b0, users are facilitated to fall asleep more easily and achieve deeper NREM sleep.\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC64...",

      "Cooperating with Open AI, our pillow can generate unique sounds based on the sound of water flowing, water droplets, heart rate, weather, and regional parameters. Every night with a different lullaby!",
      "Compared with traditional pillows, our pillow has less surface allowing mites to hide. with full body washable, F1 provides a cleaner choice for your bedding.",
      "Our eco-friendly medical-grade foam in the pillow is made with materials that are good for you and the planet. The foam is biodegradable, so it will break down naturally in the environment. It is also hypoallergenic, so it is less likely to trigger allergies or asthma. This means you can sleep soundly at night, knowing that you are not harming the environment.",
      "The inner foam is designed with open-cell foam and a specific shape, which can reduce noise and effectively improve the way liquid flows in the pillow. This not only reduces noise but also controls the speed and direction of the flow for an optimal 'floating' sleep experience.",
      "Our pillow comes with a silk cooling pillow cover to keep you cool and comfortable all night long. For those cold winter nights, we also offer a graphene heating cover to keep you warm and cozy to add on.",
      "The silk cooling pillow cover is made from 100% pure silk, which is a natural fabric that is known for its ability to regulate temperature. The silk fibers trap heat away from your body, keeping you cool and dry.",
      "The graphene heating cover, on the other hand, is made from graphene, which is a material that conducts heat very well. This means that the graphene heating cover can quickly and evenly distribute heat throughout the pillow, keeping you warm and comfortable.",
      "Limited amount of Super Early Bird Perk, price rises to early bird below after it runs out.",
      "We spend 1/3 of our lifetime in our beds, so it\u2019s only natural that we\u2019d make them cozy and appealing.",
      "But beneath all the throw pillows and frills, there\u2019s a legion of germs that also find our beds just as homey. As you lay your head on that clean white goose-down pillow, do you know what is lurking just under the surface?",
      "Our washable pillow keeps you cool and comfortable all night long, and our graphene pillow cover helps to prevent 80-95% of the bacteria and mites.",

    "company_name": "Axolook",
    "allParagraphs": [
      "Visualize, customize any outfit on a personalized 3D mannequin the next frontier of digital fashion",
      "Our Vision",
      "Axolook is an innovative 3D software platform for real-time virtual outfit try-ons.\nIt allows users to view and customize clothing on realistic 3D avatars, helping reduce return rates and improving engagement in e-commerce experiences.",
      "This project was born from a need we personally experienced: when shopping for clothing online, it often happens that you wonder: \u201cI don't know how this garment will look on me,\u201d or \u201cI don't know if this piece will match the outfit I have in mind.\u201d\nWith our software, this uncertainty disappears.",
      "How it works",
      "The user can upload any garment they like simply by providing an image of the item.\nSupported garments include: pants, T-shirts, hoodies, sweaters, tank tops, suits, jackets, hats, belts, shoes, and all kinds of accessories (such as rings, necklaces, etc.).",
      "The uploaded image (or multiple images) will be rendered onto a 3D mannequin displayed in a virtual room, where the user can view the outfit from the front.",
      "Mannequin",
      "The mannequin is fully customizable according to the user\u2019s preferences.\nUsers can adjust parameters such as:",
      "And more...",
      "This level of customization ensures a more realistic and personal visualization experience.",
      "3D Software Graphics:",
      "Here is an example of the isometric view of the software\u2019s main room.\nFrom this room, users can:",
      "(Future updates will introduce additional functionality.)",
      "When the user clicks on a monitor, a zoom-in animation will be triggered. The left monitor will display a \"Create a New Outfit\" option, while the right monitor will allow the user to browse their saved outfits.",
      "By choosing \"Create a New Outfit,\" the user will enter a 3D room with two softbox lights and a mannequin at the center.",
      "This could be an idea of a front look for the main room.",
      "Outfit Customization",
      "Upon entering the \"Create a New Outfit\" room, users can upload a photo or a webpage.\nThe software will automatically analyze the image, extract fabrics and graphics, and apply them to the 3D mannequin.",
      "Users will then be able to:",
      "Fabrics:",
      "Fabrics and designs will be rendered with high fidelity.\nFor example, if a user uploads an image of denim jeans, the texture will clearly appear as denim on the 3D model.",
      "Realization",
      "The concepts presented here reflect our vision for the software.\nThe current website is a prototype designed to demonstrate the core functionality. The final version will be a fully featured desktop application.",
      "The software will leverage a trained AI model to convert 2D images into high-quality, detailed 3D models.",
      "Eco-sustainability and reduction of returns",
      "It is common for online clothing orders to be returned because the product does not meet the buyer\u2019s expectations. Our software significantly reduces this problem by allowing users to visualize exactly how garments will look on their avatar and in the context of an entire outfit.",
      "Fewer returns mean fewer shipments, which translates to less environmental impact.\nBy improving confidence in online shopping, Axolook contributes to greater sustainability in the fashion industry.",
      "Axolook is also working for the environment! ?",
      "How the Idea Was Born?",
      "The inspiration for Axolook emerged from a personal experience. While shopping online with my co-founder, we were searching for a pair of polo shirts. We initially intended to purchase a size \"M\", but the only available option on the website was \"L\". We found ourselves wondering: \"Will the L size fit us well?\" and \"Will it match the outfit we had in mind?\"",
      "This common uncertainty led us to an idea: what if we could create software that eliminates these doubts by enabling users to try on any outfit virtually in 3D, fitted to a customizable mannequin based on their personal measurements?",
      "Initial Draft and Interface Design",
      "Our first step was to design a draft of the desktop application's user interface. We used Figma to build an early wireframe, outlining the core functionality and the visual structure of the platform.",
      "Although the current version of the application has evolved significantly since that first draft, the foundational concept and vision remain the same.",
      "Development of 3D Graphics",
      "After finalizing the draft, we began developing the 3D visual assets of the application using Blender. Our objective was to create clear, aesthetically pleasing, and functional visuals\u2014even though we were still in the prototyping stage.",
      "After several weeks of iterative design and refinement, we successfully completed the 3D environment that would represent the main room of the app\u2014the first screen the user will encounter upon opening the software.",
      "Mannequin Creation and Functionality Testing",
      "To bring our core concept to life, we needed a mannequin that could realistically represent a user\u2019s body based on customizable parameters. This mannequin would serve as the base for adapting 2D clothing images into 3D models.",
      "The creation of the mannequin was one of the most complex and time-intensive phases of our development. It required several weeks of work to ensure high-fidelity fabric rendering, realistic garment physics, and anatomical accuracy.",
      "Web-Based Simulation of the Desktop Application",
      "Once the 3D mannequin was functional, we developed a simplified web-based prototype to simulate the key functionality of the desktop software. This demo site includes a basic \"insert shirt\" button that allows users to visualize a garment on the mannequin in 3D.",
      "Please note: this version does not yet allow customization of the mannequin or editing of garments once uploaded\u2014features that will be fully implemented in the final desktop application.",
      "Demonstration Video",
      "To provide a tangible demonstration of our concept, we produced a short video showcasing the core feature: the adaptation of a 2D clothing image onto a 3D mannequin. This prototype serves to validate our technical approach and communicate the potential of our solution to future users, partners, and investors.",
      "Please note:the video is shown at the beginning.",
      "Rewards",
      "1 Year Subscription: The contributor will receive a license valid for one year.\nThe license will be activated once the user enters the provided key into the software. After one year, continued use will require a paid renewal.",
      "Lifetime Licence: The contributor will receive a license valid forever.\nThe license will be activated once the user enters the provided key into the software. No further payments will be required.",
      "Final consideration and contact information",
      "Thank you for your attention!",
      "We are three young developers passionate about technology and fashion, and we have combined these two passions to create this project.",

      "Getting the right pillow to support your sleeping posture can make a big difference in how rested you feel when you wake up. Hapi Pillow is specially designed to keep your head, neck, and spine properly aligned.",
      "Do you prefer to sleep on your back, your side, or your belly? Whichever sleeping position you pick, the Hapi Pillow provides the ultimate support for your neck and spine. This helps to prevent back pain and neck strain, so you can wake up in the morning feeling refreshed and energized.",
      "Our patented pillow design is tested to ergonomically fit the natural curves of the human body. In our testing, we focused on the natural contour of the whole spine - particularly the neck region - and created a pillow shape that can provide comfortable support for the head in each different sleeping position and for various body types. This means you'll be covered whether you are a back sleeper, stomach sleeper, or side-sleeper!",
      "Hapi Pillow is meant for relaxing, peaceful, wondrous, magical, and most importantly - \u201cHappy\u201d sleep! We made sure that every sleeping position and body type is supported, which means everyone can enjoy restful sleep and perform their best during the day.",
      "Regular pillows use a \"one size fits all\" approach - they don't care about your body type or sleeping position. Why do you put up with it? You use your pillow every single day, so you can do better! Even memory foam pillows often have very limited air circulation & temperature regulation - which impacts your sleep quality, energy levels, and happiness.",
      "Say \"Goodbye\" to that heavy, dense, hot memory foam! Our flexible CertiPUR certified foam has cooling channels built-in, which make it more breathable and lightweight. The Hapi Pillow cover is also made with CoolMax\u00ae fabric, which has a quality weave and finish that promote proper air circulation and a cool environment while you sleep.",
      "Hapi Pillow is designed, made, and assembled entirely within the USA. We focused on creating a pleasant, curved style that will look good on any bed while also being light enough to pack and bring with you. The foam is light and airy, without losing its supportive nature. The cover is woven with patented multi-channel cross-section fibers that have been specifically engineered to provide superior support and breathable, cool comfort.",
      "Thank you for visiting our Indiegogo page, and we hope you will consider upgrading your sleep! Our vision is to help every person harness the natural power of body and mind through sleep to gain more abundant health. We strive to fulfill this vision by developing sleep products that activate the natural processes of healing through healthy, comfortable, and restful sleep. In developing our products, we seek innovative designs, materials, and technology that are effective, elegant, environmentally responsible, and simple to use.",

      "Drawing inspiration from the ancient practice of Gua Sha, the Orijin Body Tool combines centuries-old healing techniques with a modern approach. Gua Sha, rooted in traditional Chinese Medicine, uses a smooth tool to release muscle tension, boost circulation, and support the body\u2019s natural healing process. We've reimagined this practice with a sleek, ergonomic design, creating a versatile tool that not only relieves stress and rejuvenates the body but also elevates your daily wellness routine to a whole new level\u2728.",
      "Did you know the body has 639 named muscles? And chances are, while you're reading this, some of yours are working overtime\u2014shoulders up to your ears, neck stiff, maybe even a clenched jaw? Sound familiar? It's all thanks to fascia, the connective tissue that holds everything in place. Over time, repetitive motions, stress, and sitting too long (hello, desk life) cause both muscles and fascia to tighten up, leading to that all-too-familiar stiffness.",
      "Not only does the OBT release muscle tension and stubborn knots, but it also loosens tight fascia, improving circulation, flexibility, and easing migraines and tension headaches. We\u2019ve got your back\u2014along with your neck, shoulders, and everything in between ?. The result? You\u2019ll feel restored, revitalized, and more at ease with your body\u2728",
      "The OBT is available in two elemental material options: natural Jade gemstone and hypoallergenic Zamak alloy, both offering durability and therapeutic benefits. Each feature of the OBT is thoughtfully crafted to target specific muscle groups and pressure points, providing relief and recovery from the tension of everyday life ?.",
      "The Orijin Body Tool, made from Zamak alloy, is ideal for hot and cold therapy due to its high thermal conductivity. For cold therapy simply submerge the OBT in ice water for 3-5 minutes (32\u00b0F/0\u00b0C), or for hot therapy, place the OBT in warm water (100\u00b0F-110\u00b0F/37.8\u00b0C-43.3\u00b0C) for 3-5 minutes. This allows the OBT to absorb and retain the temperature, providing soothing relief for muscle tension, headaches/migraines,  inflammation, and soreness.",
      "The Orijin Body Tool sets itself apart by merging ancient techniques with modern design. Rooted in tradition and crafted with a sleek aesthetic, it\u2019s both functional and visually striking. Made from high-quality Zamak alloy and Jade, it effectively relieves muscle tension and knots, providing targeted relief that helps you feel restored and ready to take on the day",
      "The OBT Recovery Body Oil, made from 100% natural and scentless Argan oil, (included in every Kit in our rewards!) is the perfect companion to the Orijin Body Tool. Argan oil, known for its rich moisturizing and anti-inflammatory properties, allows the OBT to glide effortlessly across your skin, reducing friction while nourishing and soothing.",
      "The pain is in the pudding... While the average massage in North America costs around $130 US per session (with high-end spas or specific therapeutic treatments potentially costing more), less than 20% of the 80% of adults who experience body or muscle pain actually seek professional help. With the Orijin Body Tool, we aim to relieve both your tension and your wallet, offering a convenient, affordable way to find relief in the comfort of your home.",
      "We are delighted to offer worldwide shipping! The shipping rate to your country is displayed in the above table. You'll be charged for shipping in our post-campaign survey.",
      "This isn't our first rodeo. We've been fortunate enough to receive funding and deliver on all our campaigns. We'll aim to continue that very same tradition come fulfillment time for your OBT's.",
      "We\u2019re thrilled to introduce the Orijin Body Tool to the Kickstarter community and to create a community of our own, composed of individuals who desire to slow down, be more mindful, present, and aware in their day-to-day lives. Thank you in advance for your support. If you\u2019re new to our community, welcome and thank you for joining us. For those who are returning supporters, thank you for believing in what we do \u2764\ufe0f.",

      "Imagine, years from now, signing yet another significant document in your life with this Dragon Pearl Pen, still pristine and smooth to the touch. Or on a quiet afternoon, using it to jot down reflections on bygone years in your diary\u2014the soft whisper of its nib against the paper, like the murmur of time itself. By then, it may have long grown accustomed to the warmth of your fingertips, bearing subtle marks unique to you\u2014not as wear, but as medals of the journey you\u2019ve shared.",
      "Now imagine, on a special day, passing this pen to your child or grandchild. No longer just a finely crafted relic of the past, it becomes a vessel of stories, a legacy of sentiment. What they hold is not just time-tested titanium alloy, but fragments of your dreams, struggles, and enduring warmth. This pen will weave itself into the fabric of family memory, its narrative continuing in new hands, scripting chapters yet to come.",
      "In an era of instant gratification and disposable possessions, we yearn to create things that truly preserve emotion and defy oblivion\u2014objects that accompany you from youth to old age, bearing witness to life\u2019s ebbs and flows, until they become small yet luminous footnotes in your story.",
      "This, perhaps, is the true essence of a \"dream pen\"\u2014crafted not merely for your present needs, but as an enduring legacy for your future years and for those you cherish most. It holds a timeless place in your story, living with you, carrying memories across a century.",
      "A pen that embodies a century-long dream, exceptional craftsmanship, and profound emotion deserves an equally extraordinary presentation. We understand that the Dragon Pearl Pen is more than a cherished personal possession\u2014it is a meaningful token for life's most significant moments: a gesture of respect, a vessel of blessings, or a testament to achievement.",
      "That\u2019s why we\u2019ve thoughtfully designed a custom gift box for the Dragon Pearl Pen. Whether as a graduation or coming-of-age gift, a celebration of career advancement, a token of appreciation for mentors, loved ones, or partners, or a milestone reward for yourself\u2014this elegantly packaged pen delivers a gift of weight, taste, and timeless significance.",
      "It holds more than just the power of writing\u2014it\u2019s a refined expression of quality living, lasting value, and heartfelt connection. To choose the Dragon Pearl Pen as a gift is to make a lasting promise\u2014one that transcends time and celebrates the bonds that matter most.",
      "The aluminum alloy click mechanism is lighter\u2014making it the more lightweight option.",
      "The titanium version is also light, but comes at a higher cost. Thanks to titanium\u2019s corrosion resistance, you can even write with it underwater.",
      "We offer a truly unique and personalized DIY engraving option. You can customize it with your name as a keepsake, making it a meaningful gift or memento\u2014perfect for special occasions or expressing your personal style.",
      "Just a heads-up! When you back TITANER Dragon Pearl \u2022 The Ultimate \"Dream Pen\" on Kickstarter, the shipping cost won\u2019t be charged right away. Instead, we\u2019ll collect it later through a fulfillment survey once the product is ready to ship.",
      "Please Note: The listed price is for the product only and does not include shipping or Sales tax / VAT. After the campaign ends, shipping costs will be calculated based on your region. Customs/import taxes vary by country and are the supporter's responsibility to check and pay.",
      "For 20 years, we've focused on just one thing: perfecting titanium products. From material research to precision engineering, we've accumulated deep expertise and technical mastery. We understand titanium and respect every piece we create.",
      "With 50+ successfully funded Kickstarter campaigns and a 100% delivery rate, we take deadlines and quality seriously. You can review our past projects and user feedback.",
      "Titaner uses precise CNC machining for production.",

      "CHECK OUT MY LINKEDIN",
      "I have made a decision. Things are going to change for the better. I am done with living in scarcity, working my ass off and finding it is not working. I am done with having to scrape by, being constantly busy, and still not having enough.",
      "That\u2019s why I have started this crowdfunding. To get financially healthy. But as the project is evolving, it\u2019s becoming much more: A way to reconnect with the ones I love, a way to build a sustainable future for myself beyond the crowdfunding, and a way for me to take back control and realise my dreams.",
      "I am asking you, my family, friends, and network, to help me:",
      "By reconnecting. Just talking already means a lot to me. I love getting feedback on what I am doing, as two know more than one",
      "By sharing my crowdfunding. Really taking some time to check out what I can do and share this crowdfunding with people you know who will benefit from my skills. Connect directly with them and talk about these opportunities.",
      "By sharing the crowdfunding in groups and on social media.",
      "By getting one of my products directly and working on a project together.",
      "Three years ago, I left my safe and steady PR job for a freelance career and ever since, I have been struggling to make ends meet. It turns out freelancing is a lot more challenging for me than I thought and although work has been coming in and I am busy all the time, I still miss the consistency necessary to really stay out of trouble.",
      "At the moment, I have four great projects that I am working on with a lot of potential, but they just won\u2019t materialise fast enough.",
      "I am working in regenerative business on lead generation with my business partner, Sajni, for our company called Kholo. We specialise in building organisations that actually take care of their employees instead of their bottom line, which is actually good for their bottom line in the long run. We help organisations like Cambridge to take the next step.",
      "I am working for a good friend who is building a change agency called Capacit\u00b3y, helping companies prepare for growth internally and implementing the most effective growth strategies to reach their goals. Also in a regenerative fashion.",
      "I am working with a PR software company called PR.co to build a workshop and consultancy service to help companies tell their story effectively to the right audience and make the most out of the software they make.",
      "And in music, I am working for a Web3 music streaming service called TraXs, built by SmartLabel in the Netherlands. They are putting the artist first while building amazing products that will change how we listen and appreciate music.",
      "The overarching theme here is that all of these projects have amazing potential, but none of them are making enough money at the moment. This will come at some point. Just not now.",
      "I can\u2019t just sit around and wait for them to start making money. I am taking control over my situation, and that\u2019s why you\u2019re reading this story. Why I started this project. And why I need your help.",
      "Normally, crowdfunding is to gather a big group of people to give a small sum of money and it\u2019s a way to fund projects. And yes, that\u2019s the case here too, but it is so much more than that. Besides the financial side, it\u2019s a way for me to reconnect to you, the people I love, and meet new people. It\u2019s a way to tell everyone that I am in (financial) trouble and I am asking for help to get out of it.",
      "Since I started the project and sent out the first email to friends and family, I have had countless conversations and responses. Because I don\u2019t just want to ask for money. I want to show everyone how I am doing and be fully transparent in sharing my story. And the responses have been heartwarming! I have already received backing from people I haven\u2019t talked to in a long time and I had amazing feedback. I am deeply touched by that.",
      "So this is not your average crowdfunding; it\u2019s a way to connect with friends and family and feel the warmth and strength of the community I have built throughout the years. Through living in Portugal and meeting friends here, through my music, through the projects I have done, and all the other ways I have struck a chord with.",
      "Another way this is not your average crowdfunding is that this is a lead generator. I have a massive network of amazing people who have their own network, unleashing huge potential that up until now I had no idea how to tap into. Taking a few minutes to share this crowdfunding on your socials helps. Attentively sharing what I can do with the right people in your network can prove the difference between struggling and an abundance of opportunities. When we jump on a call, we can really dig deep on what\u2019s possible and I am happy to help you identify who those people are in your network that need what I can offer.",
      "When we are constantly on the verge of not having money, that stresses us out. And when we experience stress, that messes with the brain\u2019s capacity to think clearly. That\u2019s why poor people make questionable decisions with money. Not because they are stupid and deserve to be poor, but because their situation doesn\u2019t allow them to think clearly enough and so they end up in a downward spiral.",
      "That\u2019s me at the start of this project.",
      "So first of all, the money will relieve the stress and give me peace of mind to think more clearly and being more effective in everything I do. Second, I need to pay off debt with loved ones around me and tax and social security payment backlogs. It\u2019s over \u20ac20k at the moment. And then, I am finally able to invest in myself and my dreams.",
      "The truth for me is that I don\u2019t need to pay my debts and can get around without having the money I need to stay afloat every month. I am doing great at the moment, but, over time, I have been slowly, almost unnoticeably, drowning by neglecting some of my less essential needs, hoping the tax collector won\u2019t come to hard on me, and cutting deals and corners where I can, sometimes with devastating impact on my mental health, making me struggle even more. Yes, the spiral is vicious.",
      "When the crowdfunding starts rolling, the most important debts are paid, and I can finally take a breather again after three years, I\u2019ll be focusing on taking good care of myself and building my dreams.",
      "Music is my first love and I have been tinkering with it since I was a little kid. Music has always been a means to meet people and travel. I started the band last year and it\u2019s time to invest in my music and take my endeavours to the next level. I have eight people in the band now who are eager to build with me. Having money will remove the boundaries that I set for myself and will enable me to spread more music while being able to push harder and take more risks.",
      "Secondly, I want to invest in regenerative business. This is the way to build a better future for everyone on this planet. My business partner Sajni put me on this path and together, I plan to follow it through until the end. Having money will give me peace of mind and time to build the company mindfully and find the most effective ways to make businesses more regenerative.",
      "Thirdly, I am looking forward to seeing what I am capable of when I am not constantly limiting myself financially and having to scrape by. When I don\u2019t have to rethink every euro I spend because there is abundance and to see how it opens up my mind when the financial stress dies down. When I can take proper care of myself and not just cover the basics. To see the actual potential within me come out and to be able to share that with the people around me.",
      "A beautiful by-product of this crowdfunding is a sort of formalisation of my community, a tangible overview of the people I love and who care about me. Because this won\u2019t end. Ever. This will go on indefinitely. Long past reaching my funding goal. This will be a growing community that I will keep up-to-date with my newsletter, where I\u2019ll share how this project evolves over time to celebrate the wins, share the setbacks, and become a hub that will enable me to share and help others.",
      "You\u2019re investing in me, obviously, but you\u2019re also investing in a philosophy. A future that is more human-centric, that focuses on trust, and connectedness through the art of regenerative business.",
      "What does this mean?",
      "Everything I do, I approach with the view that everything is interconnected and part of a bigger system, something that should contribute to the well-being of people, communities, and the planet. My work is grounded in principles of regeneration: fostering cultures of purpose, adaptability, and care for each other and what we do and leaving things better than we find them. Where systems are put in place that don\u2019t deplete resources but actually grow and make them better over time.",
      "I support teams in becoming more regenerative by making them more self-managed, connected, and aligned with their deeper purpose, so the business itself becomes a force for personal growth and starts spreading positive energy. When the people in an organisation thrive, the organisation can\u2019t do anything other than thrive itself too.",
      "And so all the products I sell are infused with this idea and no matter what we do together, you\u2019ll get a healthy dose of regenerative business energy to take your endeavours to the next level.",
      "The best way to support the project is to directly buy one of the products here on the right. That immediately brings in money and gives us a clear direction on how to work together. The sooner the better, as you\u2019ll be in front of the queue when it comes to realising the project.",
      "Also, by jumping on a call with me. Use this link to set up an hour meeting, or call me directly, and I\u2019ll tell you all about the campaign. You\u2019ll get the full lowdown on how I am doing, how the project is going, and we get a chance to see each other, to hear how you are doing. To connect. To help each other. As much as we can.",
      "Lastly, by taking the time to understand the products that I can offer and giving some thought to who in your network would greatly benefit from my services. I know we\u2019re all very busy but giving this your undivided attention and sharing this with, say, three people in your network, can make all the difference.",
      "With music, for instance, I am looking for people who organise music events and need DJs and people who manage artists to take the next step. An introduction would be amazing!",
      "When you buy a product. We\u2019ll have a call or meet in person, where possible. Again, this is all about connection. We align expectations and make sure we are both happy with where it\u2019s heading and, ultimately, the results. I am committed to making this a success and clear communication is key. Once a product is confirmed, it will enter a pipeline to track progress and to make sure nothing falls through the cracks. If at any point you have questions, reach out to me at info@guyvankoolwijk.nl",
      "Also, you see companies added to products. These are companies of close friends that have the knowledge and infrastructure to scale up these products or support products in various ways. I lean on them as a network of professionals, so when I may run into my limits, that doesn\u2019t mean that projects have to wait for me to continue going and grow.",
      "NEDERLANDSE TEKST",
      "Ik heb een beslissing genomen. Er moet iets veranderen. Ik ben klaar met niet genoeg geld hebben, met mezelf kapotwerken en er achter komen dat ik toch niet genoeg heb om rond te komen. Ik ben het zat om altijd druk te zijn en toch langzaam weg te zakken in schulden.",
      "Daarom ben ik deze crowdfunding gestart. Om weer financieel gezond te worden. Maar wat begonnen is als een crowdfunding ontwikkelt zich in iets dat veel groter is dan dat: een manier om de banden aan te halen met de mensen van wie ik hou, een manier om een duurzame toekomst voor mezelf op te bouwen na de crowdfunding, een manier om grip te krijgen op mijn leven en mijn dromen te verwezelijken.",
      "Ik vraag jou, mijn familie, vrienden en iedereen in mijn netwerk om me te helpen:",
      "Door een keer goed bij te praten. Dat is me al heel waardevol. Ik ben benieuwd hoe het met je gaat en naar je feedback.",
      "Door deze crowdfunding te delen en echt even de de tijd te nemen om goed te begrijpen hoe ik anderen kan helpen en dit te delen met de meest relevante mensen. Neem contact met ze op en bespreek wat mogelijk is.",
      "Door de crowdfunding te delen in groepen en op sociale media.",
      "Door direct een product van mij af te nemen en samen een project te starten.",
      "Drie jaar geleden heb ik mijn veilige PR-baan opgezegd om als freelancer aan de slag te gaan en sindsdien is het strijden om rond te komen. Freelancen blijkt voor mij een stuk uitdagender dan gedacht. Hoewel ik genoeg werk heb en ik constant bezig ben, mis ik de consistentie die nodig is om echt uit de financi\u00eble problemen te blijven.",
      "Op dit moment ben ik betrokoken bij vier geweldige projecten met ontzettend veel potentie waar ik echt in geloof, maar er komt gewoon nog niet genoeg geld van binnen:",
      "Ik doe een project samen met mijn zakenpartner Sajni en haar bedrijf Kholo waarbij we organisaties zoals Cambridge helpen zich meer regeneratief te organiseren (ik vertel verderop wat dit inhoud). Waarbij ze de werknemers centraal stellen, niet de winst. Iets dat op lange termijn juist weer goed is voor de winst. En de planeet.",
      "Ik werk voor een goede vriend die een change agency aan het bouwen is. We helpen bedrijven zich intern voor te bereiden op groei en de juiste strategie\u00ebn te implementeren om die groeien te realiseren. Ook dit met een regeneratieve aanpak.",
      "Ik werk samen met het PR-softwarebedrijf PR.co om hun klanten te helpen met workshops en consultancy zodat die hun verhaal beter kunnen vertellen aan het juiste publiek.",
      "In de muziek werk ik voor Web3 muziekstreamingdienst TraXs, gebouwd door SmartLabel in Nederland. Ze zetten de artiest voorop en bouwen producten die onze manier van muziek luisteren fundamenteel zullen veranderen.",
      "De rode draad: al deze projecten hebben enorm veel potentie, maar leveren op dit moment nog niet genoeg op. Dat komt zeker. Maar nu nog niet.",
      "En nu ben ik op een punt gekomen dat ik niet kan blijven wachten tot een van deze projecten geld op gaat leveren. Ik moet het heft in eigen handen nemen. Daarom lees je dit verhaal. Daarom ben ik dit project begonnen. Daarom heb ik jouw hulp nodig.",
      "Normaal gesproken is crowdfunding een manier om veel mensen een klein bedrag te laten doneren om een project te financieren. Dat is hier ook zo, maar het is veel meer dan dat. Naast de financi\u00eble kant is dit namelijk een manier voor mij om de banden aan te halen met jou \u2014 met de mensen van wie ik hou \u2014 en om nieuwe mensen te ontmoeten. Het is een manier om openlijk te zeggen dat ik in de (financi\u00eble) problemen zit en hulp nodig heb.",
      "Sinds ik het project ben gestart en de eerste mail eruit gedaan heb naar vrienden en familie om het project uit te leggen, heb ik veel gesprekken en reacties gehad. Ik vraag namelijk niet zomaar om geld. Ik wil laten zien hoe het echt met me gaat en volledig transparant zijn over waarom ik dit doe. En de reacties zijn hartverwarmend. Ik heb de eerste producten al verkocht aan mensen met wie ik niet heel vaak contact heb en ik krijg geweldige feedback. Dat raakt me diep.",
      "Dit is dus niet zomaar een crowdfunding. Het is een manier om de kracht en warmte te voelen van de gemeenschap die ik door de jaren heen heb opgebouwd, in Nederland, in Portugal, met de muziek, met de projecten die ik heb gedaan en op alle andere manieren waarop ik mensen heb geraakt.",
      "Een ander groot verschil is dat dit ook een manier is om nieuw werk te vinden. Ik heb een enorm netwerk van geweldige mensen, die op hun beurt weer hun eigen netwerk hebben. Dat is een bron waar ik tot nu toe niet precies van wist hoe ik die kon inzetten.",
      "Als je een paar minuten de tijd neemt om dit project op je socials te delen helpt al enorm. Dit project gericht delen met mensen in jouw netwerk kan het verschil maken tussen nauwelijks overleven of een overvloed aan werk. Laten we bellen en samen uitzoeken wie in jouw netwerk echt iets aan mijn diensten heeft.",
      "Constant net niet genoeg geld hebben is ontzettend stressvol. En stress vermindert ons vermogen om helder na te denken. Daarom maken mensen met weinig geld soms twijfelachtige financi\u00eble beslissingen. Niet omdat ze dom zijn, maar omdat hun situatie hen mentaal uitput en ze simpelweg de gevolgen niet goed kunnen overzien.",
      "Dat ben ik. Aan het begin van dit project.",
      "Het geld is dus als eerste bedoelt om stress weg te nemen en me ruimte te geven om helder na te kunnen denken en effectiever te handelen. Daarnaast wil ik zo snel mogelijk mijn schulden aflossen. Dat bedrag ligt nu net boven de \u20ac20.000 en dat vreet me op. Als daar schot in zit kan ik eindelijk investeren in mezelf en in mijn dromen.",
      "De harde waarheid is dat ik al een tijd langzaam, bijna onmerkbaar, aan het verdrinken ben in schulden. Het gaat op dit moment heel goed met me, maar door telkens wat minder voor mezelf te zorgen, te hopen dat de belastingdienst me lang genoeg met rust laat en links en rechts dealtjes te sluiten die soms verkeerd lopen met grote impact op mijn mentale gezondheid. Het is niet fijn.",
      "Zodra de crowdfunding op gang komt, de belangrijkste schulden zijn afgelost en ik na drie jaar eindelijk op adem kan komen, gaat de focus naar mezelf en mijn dromen.",
      "Muziek is de rode draad in mijn leven. Van jongs af aan ben ik er al druk mee. Muziek zorgt ervoor dat ik mensen leer kennen en Europa afreis. Vorig jaar is daar de band bijgekomen en het is nu tijd om te investeren en mijn muziek naar een hoger niveau te tillen. De band staat klaar om mee te bouwen. Met geld verdwijnen de beperkingen die ik mezelf opgelegd heb en kan ik harder groeien door meer risico te nemen.",
      "Daarnaast wil ik investeren in regeneratief ondernemen. Dit is de weg vooruit naar een mooiere samenleving. Mijn zakenpartner Sajni heeft me de ogen geopend en ik ben super gemotiveerd om hier verder in te groeien. Met geld heb ik de rust om de tijd te nemen om ons bedrijf zorgvuldig verder op te bouwen.",
      "Tot slot ben ik benieuwd wat ik kan bereiken als ik mezelf niet langer financieel hoef te beperken. Als ik niet elk dubbeltje hoef om te draaien en er meer mentale ruimte ontstaat. Dan kan ik echt goed voor mezelf zorgen en niet alleen de basis dekken. Dan kan mijn ware potentieel naar boven komen. Iets wat ik graag met iedereen wil ik delen.",
      "Een mooi bijproduct van deze crowdfunding is een soort formele bevestiging van mijn community. Een tastbaar overzicht van de belangrijkste mensen in mijn leven. Want dit stopt niet als de funding binnen is. Dit blijft groeien en blijf iedereen op de hoogte houden via mijn nieuwsbrief, waarin ik de ontwikkelingen zal blijven delen \u2014 successen, tegenslagen en alles daartussen.",
      "In mij, uiteraard. Maar ook in een filosofie. In een toekomst die menselijker is, gebouwd op vertrouwen en verbondenheid, mogelijk gemaakt door de idee\u00ebn achter regeneratief ondernemen.",
      "Wat houdt dit in?",
      "Alles wat ik doe zie ik als onderdeel van een groter geheel dat invloed heeft op wat we doen. De verhalen die ik vertel met PR bijvoorbeeld zijn onderdeel van een groter geheel dat die verhalen weer be\u00efnvloed. Werk moet bijdragen aan het welzijn van mensen en de omgeving. Mijn werk is daarmee gebaseerd op principes van regeneratie: projecten moeten energie geven, de samenwerking moet meer opleveren dan afzonderlijk bewerkstelligd zou kunnen worden, culturen cre\u00ebren die echt een doel hebben, zich moeiteloos aan passen en zorgzaam zijn voor hun omgeving. Dingen beter achterlaten dan we ze gevonden hebben. Systemen ontwerpen die niet kaalroven, maar alles juist laten groeien.",
      "Ik help teams regeneratiever te worden door autonomie te stimuleren, connectie tussen mensen te vergroten en ze in contact te brengen met hun persoonlijke diepere motivaties. Dan wordt een bedrijf een plek voor persoonlijke groei. En als het met de mensen goed gaat, volgen bedrijven vanzelf.",
      "Dus alles wat ik aanbied is doordrenkt met deze visie. Wat we ook samen doen, je krijgt een flinke dosis goede, regeneratieve, energie mee.",
      "De beste manier om het project te steunen is door direct een product hier rechts af te nemen. Dat levert me direct geld op en geeft ons richting voor een mooi project. Wees er snel bij want als de rij langer wordt sta je niet achteraan.",
      "Daarnaast: Laten we bellen. Gebruik deze link om een uur in mijn kalender vrij te maken of bel me direct. Dan vertel ik je alles over dit project, hoe het met me gaat en ik kan horen hoe het met jou gaat. Zodat we de banden aanhalen en elkaar kunnen helpen.",
      "Tot slot waardeer ik het enorm als je tijd neemt om mijn producten goed te bekijken en nadenkt over wie in jouw netwerk met me zou willen samenwerken. We zijn allemaal druk, maar als je hier je aandacht aan geeft en dit met bijvoorbeeld drie mensen deelt, kan dat al alles veranderen.",
      "Met muziek bijvoorbeeld zou je me waanzinnig helpen als je me kan introduceren aan boekers en promoters van muziek festivals en venues. Ik ben ook op zoek naar artiesten managers om te spreken en te kijken hoe ik de band en Space Kadett naar een hoger plan kan tillen.",
      "Als je een product koopt beginnen we met een goed gesprek. Verbinding staat centraal. We stemmen de verwachtingen goed af en zorgen ervoor dat we allebei blij zijn met de richting en het beoogde resultaat. Ik ben vastberaden dit tot een succes te maken en heldere communicatie is daarbij cruciaal. Zodra een product is bevestigd komt het in mijn systeem te staan om voortgang te volgen en niets over het hoofd te zien.",
      "Heb je vragen? Mail me gerust op info@guyvankoolwijk.nl.",
      "Bij sommige producten staan bedrijven vermeld. Dit zijn bedrijven van goede vrienden met de kennis en infrastructuur om deze producten op te schalen of op andere manieren te ondersteunen. Ik leun op dit professionele netwerk, zodat projecten kunnen doorgroeien, ook als ik tegen mijn grenzen aanloop.",

      "We offer specialized advice for History undergraduates. Help us help students reach their potential!",
      "Hi. I'm Michael Bennett from new startup History Skills UK.",
      "History Skills UK is a one-stop shop for the 40, 000 students who take History courses at UK universities and colleges every year.",
      "We have created a unique service for those students, using our many years of experience to help A Level & Undergraduate History Students in the UK succeed.",
      "Having been both tutors and students, we can help undergraduates with Study Skills, Essential Knowledge & the kind of Practical Advice they won't find anywhere else.",
      "We can also offer the best advice for those about to go to university for the first time.",
      "Your contributions can help turn this service into a major provider of help to the thousands of History undergraduates who struggle with Uni demands in their first year.",
      "You can help us help them turn things around, and ultimately be successful at university.",
      "We estimate that we need \u00a3500 to help our service get up and running.",
      "Your donations will help fund:",
      "We can offer some exciting perks to you, your families and friends!",
      "Those who donate \u00a310 or over will receive FREE Membership for 1 year - which can be used directly or passed on to those who would benefit the most from our services",
      "Those who donate \u00a325 or over will receive FREE Membership for 2 years AND half-price discounts on one-to-one advisory sessions, as well as a complimentary copy of our e-book 'How To Succeed at University' (published in 2026).",
      "If we are unable to reach our total goal, do not fear! Your perks will remain valid and we will use any monies raised to help us get off the ground.",
      "However, if you do help us to reach our goal we can take that extra step in reaching as many students as possible and becoming a major provider of their needs.",
      "Every year, thousands of History students find the step up from school to university difficult to manage.",
      "This is particularly true for working-class students, whose parents and schools are often unable to provide the kinds of support wealthier students take for granted.",
      "Many will feel their dreams of university life have turned into a nightmare and drop out.",
      "But it doesn't have to be like this!",
      "History Skills UK can provide help with basic skills that over-worked tutors have no time to provide. We have the space to deliver one-to-one advice and knowledge. And we can offer the kind of practical advice students really need.",
      "Sure, there are many expensive study guides and hard-to-read textbooks out there - a whole industry feeding off students and worried parents.",
      "By contrast, we can provide useful advice specifically tailored to the individual needs of students. And we won't charge the earth to provide that service.",
      "In most cases solutions can quickly be found to the difficulties History undergraduates face. And with a little help and the right kind of encouragement, students can find their feet and be back on track in no time at all.",
      "It just needs an experienced hand, willing to spend some time providing advice specifically tailored to the needs of the individual student.",
      "We can provide precisely that service.",
      "If you place your trust in us to deliver solutions by making a donation - however small - to our startup fund, we promise to build a service that always has the student at the heart of everything it does.",
      "Help us help History students to become the best versions of themselves. They, their parents and their tutors, will thank you for it.",
      "Our service is provided by people like myself who have gained the highest qualifications in History and taught the subject at university level.",
      "My record speaks for itself. I have studied and taught at a wide variety of institutions - from the University of St Andrews to Edge Hill and even the Open University.",
      "I received no help from parents and schools and had limited resources. I learned the hard way how to succeed at university. I also made many mistakes! I can draw on both my successes and failures to point the next crop of History students in the right direction.",
      "There are always risks with challenges like these. We are currently a small-scale organisation and we operate during a climate of uncertainty that affects universities all over the UK. We will have to be flexible and constantly plugged in to the problems faced by both students and the institutions they study at.",
      "But, as I have demonstrated time and time again, lack of resources and widespread uncertainty do not have to be a barrier to excellence.",
      "With your support, we will help students reach their potential.",
      "We know that times are tough and that some people just can't contribute. As a project seeking to help those students who have few resources, we understand that very well.",
      "However, that doesn't mean you can't help us grow in other ways!",

It sprays the dirty mops with clean water by a built-in pump and the mops speedy spin to scrape against a washboard to remove captured dirt, which then passes through the absorption system before being stored as wastewater.

    "allParagraphs": [
      "Cut your water usage without compromising on the shower experience",
      "Methven's Design is renowned internationally.",
      "Rua generates bigger water droplets which create up to 20% more of the total spray force than conventional showers*.",
      "Rua's innovative spray system provides better stimulation of the nerve endings, particularly the areas where nerve endings have a higher density (e.g. face). This gives you better efficiency in cleansing and rinsing and more even pressure on the skin.",
      "Rua has twice more coverage than a conventional shower*. That means twice the amount of surface area of water at the contact with the skin at any given time. It provides you with a better feeling of warmth, better feeling of coverage, and better evenness of spray pressure on the skin.",
      "We are from New Zealand, an island surrounded by the ocean. As an island nation, we think that taking care of our most precious resource - water - is extremely important. Water shortage is real in many regions around the world and it won't get better unless we do something. Spending less water on your daily shower is a great starting point. But for many, it's hard to sacrifice a great shower experience. That's why we've created Rua - a shower system, that provides exceptional power-shower experience and helps you to use less water.",
      "Beauty aside, Rua is super water efficient \u2013 it uses only 1.8 Gallons of water per minute (meets California 2018 water usage regulations). The water flow rate is optimised to be water efficient without compromising the spray's power and coverage. 1.8 Gpm (gallons of water per minute) is 28% less than 2.5 Gpm. (2.5 Gpm what US standard showerheads use, according to US Environmental Protection Agency)",
      "Using less water doesn\u2019t help the environment much if you have to use more warm water to keep your shower experience great. More warm water for your shower \u2013 more energy to heat it up.",
      "Water in the \u201cmist/cloud\u201d - type showers and traditional water-saving showerheads tend to get cool quickly after it is sprayed from the shower head. Rua retains more warmth than mist-type showers.",
      "You can choose one of the two options that work best for you. No need to call a plumber.",
      "The first option is to replace your existing hand shower - just connect Rua to your existing hose or use the one we provide.",
      "The second option is to use Rua as a wall shower and install it using the connector. Wall mount and connector come with your order - you don't need to buy them separately.",
      "Please note: We include all the accessories needed for the installation: hose, adjustable arm holder or the wall mount.",
      "Scroll down to see the installation videos.",
      "No matter where you are in the world, if you have a Rua shower, you are connected to New Zealand.",
      "There are 115 employees who work on-site at Methven's manufacturing facility in Auckland and 14 members of the company's design and innovation team who are responsible for the look and feel of the products. It sounds a lot but in fact, we are still a small team, a family. Many of our employees have worked with us for over 25 years.",
      "A significant number of our employees live locally so we invest a lot of effort in maintaining water quality and protect wildlife around the area. Now we want to bring our values globally.",
      "Take a look at our factory and meet real people who helped to create Rua.",
      "All Rua shower handsets will be manufactured at our factory in Auckland, New Zealand, which means we have full control and understanding of the Rua handset manufacturing process. And to all our backers we offer a lifetime warranty on Rua.",
      "A Lifetime Replacement Warranty applies for the lifetime of the original purchaser for domestic/residential usage. If you plan to use Rua for your business please learn more about our commercial warranty here.",
      "We have learned that coverage, flow, and warmth is what makes a great shower. Our research has shown us there are 2 key dimensions to spray coverage: (1) Total spray area covered and (2) Distribution of the spray within the total spray area (More uniform distribution = better coverage).",
      "Recap\u2026",
      "Rua uses the available water in a fundamentally better way to deliver WARMTH and SENSATION to the user also means:",
      "To deliver a great user experience with less water than a conventional shower*",
      "Here is a brief story of the Shower Technology evolution.",
      "This Rinse Efficiency video shows how the Aurajet spray pattern creates more coverage than conventional showering*.",
      "Aurajet technology helps Rua to generate up to 20% more total spray force*. It has twice the amount of a surface area of water in contact with the skin*:",
      "Rua utilizes hidden nozzles which generate individual jets of water that collide against precisely angled surfaces within the elegant contours of the showerhead. At that moment of collision, the water travels across the surface edge and launches out from the channel, creating stunning fans of water.",
      "With water shortage being a global concern, water conservation and efficiency of water use were paramount when we were developing Rua. Rua is the culmination of years of research combined with the extensive knowledge and expertise of our engineering team.",
      "When we started to design Rua, we decided it should conform to the new California State Energy Commission's regulations and delivers a flow rate of 1.8 gallons per minute or less. And we did it - Rua is the first shower with Aurajet technology to use less than 1.8 Gpm.",
      "With Rua we all can take better care of water consumption just by taking a shower. And saving water no longer means a bad shower experience - we have made sure of that.",
      "Today, with our increasingly hectic and constantly connected lives, the bathroom has become a room of considerable importance. It is the one room where we can retreat, shut the door, take time out and be ourselves. It is our sanctuary of personal wellbeing. It is important that we do what we can to enhance this very personal moment, and deliver the best shower experience possible.",
      "Conventional showers generally distribute water in sparse, uneven individual streams that result in inconsistent skin contact and localized force.",
      "In addition to that most of the standard showerheads in the US use 2.5 Gallons of water per minute (according to US Environmental Protection Agency). On the contrast, Rua uses 1.8 Gpm. This is 30% less than 2.5 Gpm.",
      "Other existing shower technologies can save water but the experience is often compromised. Weak water mists and clouds can lose heat faster. This equates to less warmth and therefore a poorer overall showering experience.",
      "Rua is a water saving shower without compromise. The beauty is in the way we create unique fans of water to deliver a truly amazing showering experience, all without using any more water.",
      "Whilst we have had Aurajet\u00ae technology for a few years, our Rua design represents a significant advancement in water saving.",
      "Rua revolutionary square design uses fewer nozzles than Aio, a more concentrated spray pattern, and only 1.8USGpm. Rua truly is the perfect balance of form and function.",
      "To upgrade your bathroom with ease, simply unscrew your old handset and add Rua standalone handset for a truly stimulating shower experience.",
      "As long as your current mixing valve meets the minimum operating pressure requirements, then there is no needs to replace your mixing valve. Minimum operating pressure is 1 bar/100 KPA/14.5 PSI. The handset needs a \u00bd inch BSP hose. This will be compatible with most existing fittings.",
      "Please note: We include all the accessories needed for the installation: hose, adjustable arm holder or the wall mount.",
      "If you have a wall shower you will be able to install Rua using an inlet connector and the wall mount. You can adjust the angle of the shower for better performance. Both accessories are included in the packaging.",
      "HERE IS WHAT COMES WITH YOUR ORDER:",
      "or 6 inches hose and an adjustable arm holder",
      "Methven started as an iron and brass foundry in 1886 in Dunedin and was involved in manufacturing ammunition for the New Zealand Army during the war years from 1939-1945.",

      "The employees in the New Zealand team has a combined service of 1306 years.",
      "Methven has been around for a few years. Actually more than a 130. Although we are old and have our own manufacturing, we are still a small company from New Zealand.

      "Why Slow Leaks Are Hard to Detect",
      "Slow leaks caused by tire punctures from screws are hard to detect because the leakage rate is often too low (i.e. ~0.1% PSI per hour). Also, natural pressure fluctuations that occur due to temperature changes during the day can mask any slow leaks.",
      "How Our Product Can Detect Slow Leaks",
      "The ZUS app stores both tire temperature and pressure history, allowing our proprietary AccurateTemp Algorithm to normalize temperature fluctuations throughout the day, so that you can see accurate tire pressure changes. In this way, you can tell whether your tires are leaking slowly or not.",

      "We've included an anti-theft locking system for free. The system will lock your sensor against others from unscrewing it. The anti-theft locking system comprises of the wrench and nuts that are included with the sensors. If you put the nut on the tire valve, put the sensor on the valve, and then unscrew the nut so that it presses up against the sensor you will not be able to unscrew the sensor after that. You will be able to remove nut and sensor only if you have the wrench in the correct size.",
      "Do I have to pay VAT/GST?",
      "Yes, customers are responsible for assuring the product can be lawfully imported to the destination country. The recipient is the importer of record and must comply with all laws and regulations of the destination country. The recipient of an international shipment may be subject to such import taxes, customs duties and fees, which are levied once a shipment reaches the recipient's country. Additional charges for customs clearance must be fulfilled by the recipient.",
      "What is the difference between the ZUS Smart Tire Safety Monitor and traditional Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems (TPMS)?",
      "As opposed to traditional TPMS products, we employ the most advanced sensors that can detect not only pressure but also temperature. Also, our proprietary AccurateTemp Algorithm is able to detect hard-to-notice slow leaks and reveal safety issues about your tires directly on your smartphone.",
      "By law all cars are required to have a TPMS installed, why do I need this product?",
      "Yes, by law all car manufacturers have to equip their cars with a TPMS system. However, most car manufacturers get around this rule by adding a cheap indirect TPMS system in their cars. The problem for indirect systems are: 1) it doesn't show you individual tire pressure. 2) it only alerts you when something goes wrong with your tire, but it doesn't tell you exactly what the problem is and which tire. 3) It only works for fast leaks and does not show the slow leaks coming from your tires. You can learn more about indirect TPMS by reading here.",
      "ZUS STSM is a great upgrade from cheap and inadequate indirect TPMS systems. If your car already has a TPMS installed that tells you exactly which tire is underinflated, you won't need an upgrade to ZUS STSM. However, a lot of users with this type of pre-installed TPMS still get the ZUS Smart Tire Safety Monitor so that they can take it on-the-go in case they ever need it for another car (i.e. vacation car rental).",
      "What devices is the app compatible with?",
      "The app is compatible with iPhone/iPad/iPod touch with iOS 8 or later and Android 4.3 or later with Bluetooth 4.0 or newer.",
      "What payment options do I have?",
      "You can pay via credit card. Select a perk and you'll see the available payment methods at checkout.",
      "How are your next generation German sensors different from other sensors on the market?",
      "What are the risks & challenges of getting the device today?",

      "Travel Tails: Your Pet Friendly Gateway to Japan",
      "Introduction",
      "Hello! I\u2019m Rebekah, known as ikigaitravelers on YouTube. Originally from the U.S., I\u2019ve called Japan home for the past two and a half years. My love for this country and its culture drives my mission to make a meaningful impact in my community.",
      "We\u2019re raising funds to launch a bold, international travel brand based in the U.S., with our first flagship locations in Japan. Our mission is simple but powerful: to support first-time travelers and expats in experiencing Japan with confidence\u2014through curated guidance, cultural insight, and affordable, pet-friendly short-term stays.",
      "This brand will be more than just a place to stay\u2014it will be a trusted gateway for global visitors. We aim to offer not only welcoming accommodations, but also reliable, culturally-informed support that takes the stress and guesswork out of exploring Japan. With your help, we can make travel more inclusive, accessible, and meaningful for people\u2014and their pets\u2014from around the world.",
      "Funds will support establishing business entities, covering legal and administrative costs, acquiring or leasing pet-friendly properties, and launching a targeted marketing campaign to connect with travelers worldwide.",
      "Why This Matters to Me",
      "When I moved to Japan with my three pets, I faced a daunting challenge: finding pet-friendly accommodations. Without a comfortable space to settle in, the stress was overwhelming\u2014for both me and my animals. This experience inspired a dream to create a pet-friendly short-term rental chain that eases the burden for travelers and relocators.",
      "This project is deeply personal. I\u2019m dedicating it to my beloved Chihuahua, Everest, who helped sparked this vision but sadly passed away last December.",
      "Your support can turn this dream into reality, ensuring others don\u2019t face the same struggles I did. Without it, this vision may stall\u2014or remain just a dream.By sharing the knowledge I\u2019ve gained, I aim to pay it forward, by creating resources that make Japan accessible to travelers and their pets in a way that\u2019s bigger than myself.",
      "How We\u2019ll Use Your Support",
      "Your contributions will bring this vision to life. Here\u2019s how we\u2019ll allocate funds:",
      "Legal Fees: Establishing business entities in the U.S. and Japan requires navigating complex legal processes. As my Japanese is conversational, I\u2019ll also need translation support to ensure compliance and accuracy.",
      "Property Investment: Funds will go toward purchasing and renovating a property to create a pet-friendly haven. This includes meeting safety and rental standards, installing pet-specific features (like accommodations for special needs or young animals), and ensuring comfort for guests new to Japan.",
      "Eco-Conscious Renovations: I plan to repurpose an existing property, highlighting the charm of traditional Japanese homes. This may involve addressing issues like mold, termites, or insulation, which can be costly but essential for quality and sustainability.",
      "Travel Costs: Visiting legal offices, real estate agents, and local experts\u2014some in different cities or countries\u2014is necessary to move the project forward efficiently.",
      "Licensing & Certification: Compliance with U.S. and Japanese regulations is non-negotiable. Funds will ensure all safety and legal standards are met.Marketing: To reach travelers and pet owners who need this service, we\u2019ll invest in a strategic marketing campaign to build awareness and trust.",
      "Contingency Fund: A small portion will cover unexpected expenses, ensuring flexibility as we navigate this ambitious project.I\u2019m committed to transparency, with regular updates on how every dollar is used to bring this vision to life.",
      "Donor Perks",
      "YouTube Series: Follow our journey through a dedicated YouTube series, where all donors will be credited as sponsors.",
      "Appreciation Wall: Every contributor\u2019s name will be honored on a custom dog tag display in our pet-friendly properties, celebrating your role in this dream.",
      "If We Don\u2019t Reach Our Goal",
      "If we fall short, every dollar will still go toward critical startup costs, ensuring progress toward launching this business.",
      "The Impact",
      "This project is about more than travel\u2014it\u2019s about creating hope and support for pet owners navigating the challenges of relocating to or visiting Japan.",
      "I\u2019ll never forget meeting a woman who tearfully shared that she gave up her dog before moving to Japan, believing there was no support for pet owners. It broke my heart, but it also lit a fire in me to take action.",
      "With your help, we can provide a safe, welcoming space for travelers and their pets to land, decompress, and start their Japanese adventure with confidence. This business will bridge cultural and logistical gaps, making Japan more accessible and inclusive for pet lovers worldwide.",
      "Why I\u2019m the Right Person for This",
      "Personal Experience: I\u2019ve lived the challenges of moving to Japan with pets\u2014navigating high costs, complex logistics, and emotional stress. I understand what pets and their owners need to feel safe and settled.",
      "Proven Track Record: I\u2019ve successfully purchased property in Japan and managed a U.S. based rental through a professional team, giving me hands-on experience in real estate and property management.",
      "Cultural Connection: My love for Japan\u2019s culture of care and community inspires this project. I\u2019m committed to honoring that spirit by giving back through a business that serves others.",
      "Risks & Challenges",
      "The biggest risk is not trying\u2014and we\u2019ve already taken that first bold step. While this journey won\u2019t be easy, I\u2019m confident in my ability to connect with the right experts and professionals. Your support will provide the resources to make this vision a reality, from legal compliance to property renovations. With your backing, I believe this goal is 100% achievable.",
      "Other Ways to Help",
      "Can\u2019t contribute financially? You can still make a difference! Share this campaign with friends, family, and pet lovers who might resonate with our mission. Every share brings us closer to our goal.",
      "Final Call to Action",
      "Join me in creating a pet-friendly haven for travelers in Japan. Your support\u2014whether through a donation or sharing this campaign\u2014will help turn this dream into a reality, making Japan a more welcoming place for pet owners worldwide. Let\u2019s do this together!",

Why stay indoors when you can take high-quality entertainment anywhere? From mountaintops to lakesides, Nomad bridges the gap between exploration and connectivity, transforming how we experience our favorite content.",

      "The vacuum function not only meets the use of common compression bags on the market, but you can also try to extract a vacuum for your lunch or fruit to extend the insurance time, and continue to enjoy it when appropriate!",
      "The KOLI hoover comes with a replaceable filter cartridge that blocks and attracts fine particles, ensuring long-lasting protection of the movement while cleaning! The one-touch operation and compact size make it suitable for users of all ages. The transparent dust container makes it easy to monitor the capacity of the dust container and know when it is time to empty it.",
      "In our daily life, the ubiquitous dust often causes us headaches, and a lightweight vacuum cleaner is especially important. However, most of the products are not portable and can only be placed in one place, even with a layer of dust. That's why we have developed KOLI, a portable vacuum cleaner, which not only has the function of inflating, vacuuming and lighting! We believe that you must lack such a product in your life!",

We specialized in watchmaking and watch modification, in which we take pride in what we do. Our founder, B.Q.Jack, has more than 15 years in watchmaking - which we genuinely called him a watch factory master. With a group of designers and engineers works perfectly, we keep designing and developing watches every day!",

      "The rule \u201call-or-nothing\u201d in watches is obeyed by watch lovers. It could be anyone of you that adore the minimalistic watch -- THE MOONPHASE or THE REIN; but perhaps some of you may want to have something more complex in your watches. Imagine you have a watch allows you to handle every situation like a boss, how awesome would that be? \u201cTHE ALL-ROUND\u201d can just turn imagination into reality. A price-friendly, excellently designed with a german style, and equipped with the best multi-functions watch -- that is \u201cTHE ALL-ROUND\u201d.",

      "When making a high-end watch, we obey the following rules which we think is most important for watchmaking.",
      "Mechanical watches with multifunction are always adored by watch lovers. However, unlike quartz watches, they are always very heavy and bulky on wrists. And we understand that the size of these amazing mechanical watches can be inconvenient for daily wear.",
      "In order to have a nice mechanical watch but with a thin design, we provide the best we can: With the well-designed cutting of the case and the super-high quality dome shape sapphire, our watch provides an incredible slim appearance. The thickness of the watch is only 8.5mm exclusive the dome shape sapphire. With the done shape sapphire the total height will be 13.4mm.",
      "Every part of our design is uniquely made for reaching our goal: a thin mechanical watch. We have gone under many tests on making a thin, durable watch. Our design team remade the dial part more than five times to remove 10-30C each time. There are no words can fully describe the hardship we had in the process,but we have put our efforts wholeheartedly in making this price-friendly, slim, well-functioned, mechanical watch.",
      "'",
      "THE ALL-ROUND is multifunctional and is full of \"indicators\" on the dial. You can get all the information you need daily at a glance-- Mastering everything like a boss.",
      "We try to avoid useless decoration in our design: Like putting a 24-hour hand over a 24-hour disc; this is meaningless. We make sure everything you need is on the dial, and solely on that.",
      "For producing luxurious watches, we persist to use only sapphire crystal for both sides of the watches. Due to the remarkable hardness of sapphires - 9 on the mohs scale, our watches can hardly be damaged by plain scratches. Thus, we believe that sapphire crystal is the most suitable material for a daily wear.",
      "Dome shaped sapphire crystal is used to give an ultimately slim appearance to the watch. As sapphire is a hard material (A 6mm thick raw sapphire material is used to craft into a 4.8mm dome shaped crystal), it is beyond difficult to make the dome shaped sapphire. Since it is costly and time consuming (our machine can only produce 3 pieces of dome shaped sapphire crystal max. per day), the yield rate is low.",
      "Movement is the soul of all watches and that is exactly what attracts all watch collectors. Our factory has more than 10 years of experience in Swiss and Japan movement watchmaking and watch modification.",
      "This time we selected the Miyota 9100 for our movement, which is well-known for its reliability and stability. This Japan movement functions with a frequency of 4Hz (28,800 A/h), 26 jewels, 40-hour power reserve, automatic winding, and a sweep second movement. With a movement of height 5.52mm and 30mm overall diameter, it is super slim. Combining both thin body and functionality, this movement is only used in high-class watches. Although the price of this movement is very high, we persist to provide the best we can.",
      "Watch modification and movement tuning are our central focus. As such, absolute accuracy is always on our important checklist. We ensure the quality of every part by using strict control testing standards before assembling the watches.",
      "The testing procedure lasts 7 days",
      "Day 1 Before assembling the watches, the movement is fully wound (also known as T0) mechanically. The movement is tested in five positions, crown left, crown up, crown down, dial-up and dial down. Then given a rest period of 24 hours(also known as T24) , the movement is tested again in the five positions.",
      "Day 3 After assembling all the parts together, the watch is put into an auto-winding machine for 1 day. The watch would be fully wound and be tested with the same testing procedure in Day 1.",
      "Day 5 The watch keeps putting into an auto-winding machine. The watch would be fully wound and be tested with the same testing procedure on Day 1.",
      "Day 7 Before packing, the watch is fully wound(T0) and is tested in five positions again.",
      "All our watches have to pass all of the above procedures before delivery. We make sure that the accuracy of our watches is highly maintained in -20~+20 seconds/day. We tested the watches in more positions than the normal quality checkups do - we tested the watches in 5 positions while the others tested in 3 positions only.",
      "We are all perfectionists, we see the pairing of the best leather strap and BEHRENS watches is an obligation. We provide a high quality fine crafted Italian calf leather strap to give you the most comfortable and pleasant wearing experience. The strap with an interchangeable catch on the lugs side allows you to change your strap without any special tool.",
      "For this project we have selected a manufacturer for producing higher grade straps. Our blue will be a more vivid blue than ever; as well as the durability of our straps. Although the cost has increased by 55%, we hope to bring the best onto your wrist.",
      "- Environmentally friendly mineral tanning according to the \"Blauer Engel\" guidelines.",
      "Case design is one of the significant symbols of our watches which is also widely loved by 150+ BEHRENS ORIGINAL customers. Our dedication for watch making is clear: The case is made of 316L stainless steel which is widely used in high-end watches. We applied many different production processes to make a remarkable watch case. Multi-polishing methods are applied: including mirror polished on the bezel and the edges of the lugs, horizontal brushed on the sides, vertical brushed on the lugs and circular brush on the back. Although these production methods are long and costly, we aim to give you the best looking, durable, and elegant watch cases. Besides, the four lugs of the case are separately produced; the angle of the watch will be sharp and absolute. Such costly production method could only be found in luxury watches production.",
      "We innovated a new method of index making - the Diamond Cutting Index. It is also used in THE MOONPHASE model(our previous Kickstarter project). The index is cut by a diamond cutter 20 times in two directions; thus the surface of the index is a complex obliques. To give the dial a luxurious touch, light is our major resource. With light reflects on the index\u2019s glossy surface from different angles, a rainbow(chrome) color is created. We believe such natural phenomenon will attract many of you.",
      "We are confident about the quality of our watches - BEHRENS ORIGINAL watches. Each watch is backed by a 2-year warranty. We have our own factory and watch masters performing quality checks and maintenance everyday before shipping. So rest assured, your precious watches are well taken care of and are ready to give you the most comfortable wearing experience!",
      "We pledged to inherit Peter Behrens\u2019 (14 April 1868 - 27 February 1940) design philosophy on watchmaking. He was a German architect and designer; and also one of the important figures to the modernist movement.",
      "\u201c...to continue innovating is always been our life goal. All watches are fixed in form and have the design of all looking alike. If we need to break that pattern, we will have to break it from the root -- the movement.\u201d",
      "We have been modifying our own movement since 2012 and testing it for years before revealing it to the world. In honouring his name and his inspiring achievement, we named after him and thus, BEHRENS ORIGINAL.",

      "Minimalist outside. Over-engineered inside. Built to brew clean, balanced, and consistent coffee.",
      "The dripper project began three years ago with an ambitious goal: to design the world\u2019s first flat-bottom dripper that merges fluid dynamics, design principles, and mechanical engineering.",
      "The end result \u2014 aesthetically simple, mechanically over-engineered, and experientially optimized to bring out unrealized flavour notes from coffee.",
      "We are a research studio focused on documenting ordinary moments.",
      "We believe the intentional act of brewing pour-over coffee is a meaningful daily reminder to make space and savour ordinary moments. From selecting lightly roasted beans, smelling them as you open the bag, making mental connections to the flavour notes on the packaging, imagining how fine or coarse to grind, to taking that first sip, each step invites presence.",
      "Within this process, we noticed that the dripper is the object that ends up being the most visually prominent, the one we look at the longest. This observation led us to a new design philosophy around what a dripper should be, and what it can become.",
      "So, we designed a dripper that remains quietly in the background and unobtrusive instead of trying to be the main character. We want users to focus on the aroma of the coffee, the sound of water pouring over the coffee bed, and the flow of the brewing ritual that leads to that first sip.",
      "Aesthetically simple, mechanically over-engineered, and experientially optimized to bring out unrealized flavor notes \u2014 these qualities are the byproduct of our serendipitous encounter with a product design studio called over_engineered.",
      "Three years ago, during the research phase of this project, we had both qualitative and quantitative data on what makes a good flat-bottom dripper \u2014 yet we struggled to translate that data into a tangible product. After going through our V1 and V2 prototypes, we hit a wall due to conflicting design philosophies and manufacturing complications. Thanks to our new partner, over_engineered, we were finally able to define and visualize what \u201cjust enough\u201d looks like for our dripper \u2014 grounded in research, and made real through design.",
      "Our Yeoyu Dripper is made of 304 stainless steel for sustainability, features an airtight double wall for thermal mass, an optimized diameter for aroma, and a sandblasted finish for a smooth yet matte tactile experience.",
      "We look at innovation in two different ways. One approach is to create something entirely new that has never existed before. The other is to improve an existing product and create a subsegment within a mature category.",
      "We chose the latter. Together with the over_engineered team, we developed a new interchangeable puck system that minimizes clogging and distributes extracted coffee through multiple channels, resulting in a \u2018just right\u2019 flow rate. Our focus on the post-percolation process, pushing extracted coffee through a puck, opened up new possibilities for flavor articulation.",
      "During our usability research phase, we found that we needed three specific components to further improve the user experience of our coffee dripper: a silicone gasket to hold the puck in a snug fit, a silicone bottom pad to protect the carafe from direct contact with stainless steel, and a polycarbonate saucer to ensure a global fit with most carafes on the market.",
      "Throughout our research, we tested different types of flat-bottom paper filters. We designed the dripper to be compatible with the Kalita Wave 185 filter, SIBARIST flat filter, April filter, and Origami Wave filter.",
      "While it was designed in Vancouver, the idea was dreamt in Seoul, encouraged in Berlin, inspired in Kyoto, and confirmed in Copenhagen.",
      "Together with Yeoyu and the over_engineered team, we are Canadians living in a beautiful city called Vancouver, with roots that trace back to South Korea, Japan, and China. It was important for us to acknowledge that and reflect it in our dripper, a reminder that good design is a shared language. For us, it\u2019s more than just a dripper.",
      "It takes a village to bring something from zero to one. I\u2019m sure many folks we came across throughout this product research and development journey might not know how helpful it was to hear a word of encouragement and genuine feedback. Hoping more folks know how much we are grateful for their help, here is the list of people we\u2019re thankful for and their contributions.",

      "Also at the prototype stage, the problem of material selection was solved. We had originally planned to use lightweight plywood, but the complexity of processing and the need to use lacquers, solvents, and grinding added cost and risk that we chose not to take to ensure a more affordable product and fewer potential delays in manufacture.",
      "The wood-fiber material selected for the Jollylook Auto contains less glue than plywood and does not contain formaldehyde at all, features a surface that does not require additional processing, looks magnificent, and is easily able to be manufactured on our in-house laser cutter. The final finish has been further improved by laser cutting techniques used by Artyom which create a very attractive look to the cuts and enhances the overall appearance of the camera.",
      "The development unit was developed by us for the original cardboard Jollylook camera and has been proven to be a sturdy and reliable unit.",

      "Our vision is to create exciting, fun to use cameras that feature striking design and offer creative photographic features not included in other affordable instant cameras.",
      "Our first camera, the cardboard constructed Jollylook Instant Camera did exactly that. However, over the course of its development and production, we experienced many issues, from problems with parts delivery from suppliers, material choice and reliability and critically, poor manufacturing quality control by our selected Chinese manufacturing partner.",
      "These issues resulted in us having to invest our personal savings and borrow further funds to continue to meet our obligations to backers. Production was moved from China to Ukraine, and a new manufacturing and assembly facility was created. The design of the Jollylook was improved to enhance reliability and employees were sourced and trained to assemble the new, improved Jollylook. Production of the new Ukrainian made cardboard Jollylook commenced in late January 2019.",
      "We learned significant lessons from the development of the first Jollylook, and have taken all of those lessons and incorporated them into the way we designed the Jollylook Auto. We have identified the best materials, suppliers of key parts, glues, assembly techniques and more, and have extensive experience with all of these materials and suppliers from making the original Jollylook. We are better placed today than at any previous time to bring the Jollylook Auto to fruition successfully, ensuring that these lessons learned at significant cost will assist us to fulfill all our obligations to backers of the Jollylook Auto in a timely manner.",

No twists, no clicks\u2014simply push and pull to use. It's that effortless. Whether you\u2019re jotting down a phone number or slicing open a package, the cap flies off like it\u2019s reading your mind.",
      "Engineered with rock-solid stability, we've made sure that this structure is the most secure ever. No need to worry about accidental opening. It's easy to use and always ready.",
      "Inside? Two tools in one sleek body: an eternal pen and a razor-thin precision blade. Both snap into place with a satisfying clink. Because inspiration\u2014or a stray loose thread\u2014won\u2019t wait for you to fiddle with screws.",
      "Now, let's dig a little deeper about DartInk:",
      "Because tools shouldn\u2019t slow you down. Because \"ready for anything\" should fit in your pocket. And because we\u2019re done compromising between \"useful\" and \"elegant.\"",
      "DartInk isn\u2019t a gadget. It\u2019s the quiet confidence of knowing you\u2019re prepared\u2014for scribbles, surprises, and everything in between.",
      "DartInk wasn't just thrown together; it was meticulously crafted with purpose. The choice of Gr5 titanium for its construction is no accident. This material is known for its exceptional strength, ensuring DartInk can withstand the rigors of daily use. Its corrosion-resistant properties mean it will look as good as new, even after years of exposure to different elements.",
      "Measuring 2.74in(only 2 coins long) and weighing a 0.62oz (the weight of 1.5 coins), DartInk disappears into your life. You won't even remember it\u2019s there\u2014until you need it.",
      "Attach it to your necklace or keychain; DartInk's design ensures it's always within reach, ready to jot down thoughts. Just imagine slicing open a package at the post office, then signing for it, with the same device. How cool is that!",
      "Have you ever been in a situation where a brilliant idea popped into your head, only to be lost because you couldn't quickly access a pen?",
      "DartInk eliminates that frustration. No ink refills, no pen-hunting. Always ready for inspiration or signatures. This eternal pen defies traditional limits, writing smoothly on any surface like paper, wood, or walls. Its special nib and ink ensure legible lines, making it a reliable writing companion.",
      "Hidden within DartInk is a multi-purpose mini knife with a quick-release blade. Imagine all the everyday items you could effortlessly slice through with it: crisp sheets of paper for your next project, sturdy leather for crafting or repairs, tough ropes for tying down gear, twigs for kindling a fire, those pesky plastic straps on delivery packages, pills that need to be divided for precise dosing, and even sturdy cardboard boxes.",
      "But this mini knife doesn't stop at cutting. It also features a ceramic bead at the tail end, specifically designed for breaking windows in emergency situations. Whether you're stuck in a car after an accident or need to escape from a building, this bead can be a literal lifesaver, providing you with a quick and reliable way to shatter glass and gain access to safety.",
      "You'd think this knife was versatile enough, but it's more so. It has three 1.5mm x 6mm tritium tube slots for glow-in-the-dark inserts. These make the pen visible in the dark, so you can find it instantly in your backpack or car at night, making it a reliable companion anytime.",
      "We've designed exclusive discount tiers just for our Kickstarter backers. Each tiered package comes with an array of essentials: the DartInk pen body, a graphite nib, all packed in a sleek and secure packaging.",
      "Make DartInk uniquely yours with optional add-ons:",
      "Join us on our exciting journey from the inception of the DartInk idea to its mass production and eventual delivery. We're committed to keeping you updated every step of the way. Our estimated timeline indicates that production will be completed around June, followed by the commencement of shipments.",

In the feudal era, samurai stood as a revered class, dedicated to their daimyo, thriving on the lands and salaries bestowed upon them. Yet, amid wars and political upheaval, some samurai lost their masters and transformed into ronin, embodying resilience and honor.",

Timascus, also known as titanium Damascus or Moku-Ti, embodies the spirit of innovation in metallurgy and the craftsmanship of metal products. Composed of two or more titanium alloys, this remarkable material is not only corrosion-resistant and non-magnetic but also remarkably lightweight. Its distinctive pattern imparts an exceptional uniqueness to the Ronin watch, elevating it to a symbol of artistry and masterful craftsmanship.",

The box's aged finish captures the essence of timeless Japanese aesthetics, evoking a sense of history and artistry that celebrates the dedication to fine craftsmanship and cultural heritage.

      "In 2022, OVD embarked on an inspiring and transformative journey by relocating its design operations to Japan. Our chief designer, Ricky, found himself captivated by the enchanting essence of Japanese culture, an endless source of inspiration that influenced his creative vision. The design for the Ronin watch took shape during a remarkable trip to the majestic Himeji Castle in Hyogo Prefecture. There, Ricky delved deep into the castle\u2019s rich history, exploring its intricate architectural details, the haunting echoes of its wartime artifacts, and the impressive weapons depot that speaks to its storied past. This immersive experience not only enriched Ricky's understanding of Japan's heritage but also sparked a profound creative transformation, resulting in the creation of an exceptional timepiece that embodies the spirit of resilience and craftsmanship.",

      "This cheeky ladle has a Soft Top that will mold to pan or bowl to scoop up all the yummy food.",
      "Hi, I'm Gavin - I am obsessed with food (cooking and most importantly, eating it!) and I'm constantly dreaming up inventions or techniques to make my life easier, especially in the kitchen where I spend most of my time.",
      "The kitchen is where the design for SCOUPS was born. I wanted a tough ladle with a soft silicone top that could mold and softly scrape the bottom and sides of pots and pans to 'SCOUP' up every last drop.",
      "Whether you're a chef, cook, baker or a foodie, you know how sad it is to leave food behind because your plastic or metal ladle just can't get to the bottom and sides of your pots and pans. We are so excited to finally launch SCOUPS with its specially designed soft-top. No soup left behind!",
      "SCOUPS is the ladle of your dreams. Not only is it a strong and colourful ladle but it's also a spatula and a measuring cup. SCOUPS is going to be your new BFF in the kitchen.",
      "You will always have the right tool in your hand with SCOUPS.",
      "The patented design of SCOUPS is simple but effective. The sturdy soft-top head holds just over 3/4 cup. But then by applying a small amount of pressure, the soft half of the head molds against the inside of your pot, so you can easily SCOUP up every last drop. Once the pressure is released, the soft-top head will snap back into shape.",
      "I also noticed that metal and hard plastic ladles would damage my nonstick pots and pans by scraping the bottom. So I created SCOUPS to have a silicone outer layer to softly scrape without damaging your pots and pans.",
      "We didn't want to design another boring monochrome ladle so we created SCOUPS in 3 delightful color combinations to bring a little happiness to your kitchen.",
      "We added useful ML and Cup measurements on the inside of the soft-top head to help make your cooking and baking easy peasy.",
      "There's no need to rummage around for measuring cups or constantly changing utensils when you're making pancakes, chilli or soup. SCOUPS can measure, softly scrape and scoop.",
      "SCOUPS is BPA Free and dishwasher safe. While we don't recommend accidentally putting SCOUPS in your oven, SCOUPS has a very high heat resistance (392 \u00b0F / 200 \u00b0C). For reference, you should not serve soup hotter than 210\u00b0F (99\u00b0C).",
      "As production has just been completed and the shipment is on its way to us, you (the backer) will not have to wait long to receive the SCOUPS Spoon. Shipment should arrive in Toronto at the end of sept and we can start shipping out the SCOUPS Ladle to you in October.",
      "Production Completed!!",
      "While developing this product, we took our time to make sure we designed the best possible product for you. We wanted to make sure the ladle did what it was supposed to while being able to withstand the rough and tumble of a kitchen utensils' daily life. We had to rigorously test, redesign and change materials numerous times to make sure the spoon is exactly how we wanted. And now we have the spoon in our hands, we think this has been completely worth it.",
      "We partnered with an experienced kitchen utensil manufacturer and they have been involved in the design process from the beginning offering advice and modifications to make the product better, stronger and more useful. We\u2019ve already invested in tooling and production has already been completed. As with any production, there are always variables that are not entirely under our control, but we are confident that by having a robust design and by working with trustworthy suppliers and manufacturers, we are reducing as many risks as possible to have a smooth production process and deliver on time.",

      "Safety is a priority with b-box. Keeping bees at home means your hive is constantly surrounded by people - including children! That's why b-box has exclusive features that allow you to care for your bees without disturbing or agitating them.",
      "Our patent-pending honey harvesting system is easy to use and requires no protective clothing. Even better, no bees get squished in the harvesting process. Plus, you only have to take a small portion of honey each time \u2013 leaving enough for your bees to have some too!",
      "Tiny apartment? No garden in sight? Backyard beekeeping is no longer just for people with backyards! b-box requires less than 1 meter square of space so even those without large outdoor areas can enjoy b-box and join the home beekeeping movement.",

It\u2019s time that home beekeeping caught up with modern technology! That\u2019s why we\u2019ve re-engineered the traditional beehive to be more people and bee friendly \u2013 not to mention better adapted for domestic use.",
      "Bee Chimney: Did you know that in nature honey bees even build their hives in rock crevices high above the ground? That was our inspiration for the bee chimney \u2013 if we could move the entrance and exit point of bees away from human level we could reduce negative interactions between keepers and their bees.",
      "Bee Viewer: In traditional hives you have to disrupt your bees to check on their health. Imagine if a giant suddenly took the roof off your house! With b-box, regularly agitating (and sometimes squishing) your bees is no longer necessary. Polycarbonate walls (the same material as shatterproof windows and eyeglass lenses) are hidden below the warm and cozy wood exterior panels of b-box, allowing you to observe your hive anytime you like! See them at work, storing honey and building honeycomb as you please. This also means you can monitor your bees\u2019 health without disturbing the hive.",
      "Patent Pending Honey Harvesting System: This may be the most revolutionary part of b-box. With the pull of a lever you can separate the honeycomb chamber from the rest of the hive. Bees will be able to exit the honeycomb chamber but not enter and the chamber empties out within a few hours. Then you can harvest your honey in a bee free environment! No protective clothing required. And, even more importantly, no bees die in the process!",
      "Modular Honeycomb: Sometimes we forget that honey is our bees' food too! That\u2019s why we developed our modular honeycomb \u2013 by taking only one of our 16 mini honeycomb frames instead of a large sheet you can control exactly what impact your honey consumption has on your hive\u2019s health.",
      "Customizable Hive: The body of b-box is a customizable hive space that allows you to organize your bees\u2019 home however you see fit. Whether you\u2019d prefer to fill it with traditional frames or give your bees some room to create their own structure just like in nature, b-box let\u2019s you do it!",

Volvo named beeing as one of the most environmentally conscious startups in Italy through their Taste of Volvo program. National Geographic wrote about their past projects in measuring air quality through the analysis of honey. And the Climate-KIC program supported by the European Union, invested in the development of b-box.",
      "The story of beeing started two generations ago, with Roberto's (left) grandparents. They kept bees in the Italian countryside and those traditions have been handed down. Combining that traditional knowledge with Gabriele's (right) passion for technology and innovation  \u2013 beeing was born!",
      "We are already a fixture in the beekeeping community in Italy \u2013 offering anti-theft technology for traditional hives and providing regular education opportunities and community initiatives. We even created and ran an innovative program that looked at air quality and environmental pollution in 20 different cities through the analysis of honey. We\u2019ve learned a lot from working so closely with professional beekeepers across the country and have brought this expertise to the creation of b-box.",

Bring to your kitchen an innovation that will change your attitude and relationship to cooking.",
      "It all starts with an ultrasonic generator. It receives energy from the battery and converts it into a high-voltage and high-frequency signal. This means, for example, that 12 V makes 900 V and at a certain frequency it passes this voltage on. In order for it to be an ultrasonic generator, the signal must run at a frequency of 20,000 Hz or more.",
      "This signal goes on to the ultrasonic transducer, which is one of the most important parts of ultrasonic cutting. The ultrasonic transducer acts as a kind of converter. Its purpose is to receive a high-frequency electrical signal and convert it into a high-frequency mechanical motion.",
      "And at the end of this process is a booster that acts as an acoustic resonance enhancer. This is traditionally attached to the tip or the blade. In our case, however, we wanted to preserve the design of a traditional knife, so we went without a booster and fixed the blade directly to the transducer.",
      "The knife is equipped with a battery and wireless charging, including a wireless charging stand. You are not hindered by the length of a power cord. Simply take the knife with you wherever you need it and place it back into the wireless charger after you finish cutting.",
      "Get your first complete ultrasonic kitchen knife package for $348 (Estimated delivery June 2024) or $296 (Estimated delivery Sep 2024). This discounted price is 10% or 24% lower than the suggested retail selling price of $390.",

The ultrasonic knives are just the beginning of our journey.",
      "Notes:",
      "* In the video and text we state that the knife is 36 times sharper that a standard kitchen knife. This was based on our test where we used a standard / common kitchen knife and compared it in a cutting test to our ultrasonic knife. We used a pt50a sharp electronic tester, which measures the weight / strength exerted to cut a synthetic wire. * In the video and text we state that it is patented technology.

      "If you\u2019re the kind of person who likes to stay cool both literally and figuratively, then you are going to love Airable. (Airable's design is patented and has received an award for its design.)",
      "Airable is the only wearable fan in the world that has a magnetic fastener for your clothes. This allows Airable to remain securely attached even with rough movements. (E.g.: Running, boxing, doing front/backflips, and more)",
      "Airable was designed ergonomically so it rests comfortably around your neck and shoulder.  It was also designed and tested to be aerodynamically effective. The air passes by the neck and cools down faster.",
      "Airable fans turn 180 degrees, making it easier for you to customize the airflow.",
      "Our propeller was not built in a day. We've built and tested over 500 propellers. Instead of simply changing the angles, we modified the pressure applied to each wing, used different materials, calibrated the noise according to the shape of the wing, and developed the optimal propeller to apply to Airable.",

      "Everybody complains about the scorching weather but nobody does anything about it. Now, VOILA!",
      "We developed and tested over 500 different propellers, and it is 1/10th the size of our competitor's propeller. We have visited our manufacturers and worked hard to get the best material and components.",
      "We're a small team (South Korean) of dedicated individuals who've been on a rollercoaster.",
      "We researched, developed, and applied a technology that minimizes loss of airflow to the back of the neck based on the Coand\u0103 effect. The Coand\u0103 effect is the tendency of a fluid jet to stay attached to a convex surface.",
      "We researched, developed, and applied technology that can minimize the loss of airflow towards the back of the neck. This loss of airflow is caused by the Coanda effect, which is when a jet flow attaches itself to a surface and remains attached even when the surface curves away towards another direction.",
      "It needs to be wearable, so the design was VERY important.",
      "Making a small and beautiful product that fully contains a fan's function was a lot more complex than I thought.",
      "If I made it bigger and not worry about the design, I could have made it without any trouble. But would I be proud of my product? The answer would be NO.",
      "So I had to dig deep.",
      "The big reason why companies have not been able to successfully make small-sized wearable fans is most likely because of the noise. The noise generated can be loud and unpleasant because the fan needs to rotate at a high speed in order to create airflow within a small area.",
      "We tried various methods such as applying a vibration pad to the mount that holds the motor, changing the mount's material to hard and soft, and creating a vibration dispersion shape.",
      "Just as a small car engine has less power than the engine of a tank, it is difficult to make a strong airflow if the propeller is small.",
      "In order to create a design that is both small and efficient, we have tested a wide variety of fans and propellers such as a wingless method, a blower fan, an axial fan, and a reverse dual fan. Airable's propeller is about 1/10th the size of our competitor's propeller.",
      "Rather than just changing the angle, we designed it by changing variables such as Camber, Skew, Chord, Lake, Pitch, and NACA airfoil, which are complex variables of the propeller. We developed it by conducting CFD and wind tunnel experiments.",
      "In addition, the battery's compatibility (voltage, electric power), the motor, and the wind intake are all more important than the propeller alone. We tailored the exclusive motor and the whole battery to balance the product, and tested it after making numerous changes to the mechanical parts.",
      "The three men above have contributed greatly to our campaign. They have contacted us first through our advertisement and since then have shown great love and helped in many ways like strengthening our content, writing skills, and giving us honest feedback.

      "We've Combined Art with Functionality to Create your Next Chef Knife.",
      "Myoshi knives is created by Eyal Azerad, a world renown sword-maker and founder of Darksword Armory inc. For the past 23 years, Eyal Azerad has been manufacturing high end European swords and armors for private collectors and important movie and gaming productions. Most notably, Eyal Azerad has worked closely with Ubisoft during the making of Assassin's Creed II and the weapons for the Lord of the Rings theater adaptation. Both of which have been brought to fruition in Darksword Armory\u2019s forge in Montreal, Canada. By travelling to museums and private collections in Europe and  Japan, Eyal was able to carefully examine blades from all over the world from a standpoint of design, functionality and metallurgical composition. This affords him with a unique perspective on what makes a blade effective and elegant in both form and function.",
      "After years of development, the Myoshi lines stem from a deep desire to create unique, high end professional chef knives combined with clean designs. To this end, we sourced the highest quality materials to produce a beautiful work of art. It would not only be a stunning piece in any kitchen, but prove to be an exceptional knife for both cooking enthusiasts and professionals alike. We extensively examined various types of wood to compare the different grains, weights and hardness. We  crafted an ergonomic grip that has long lasting performance without compromising aesthetic beauty.This enabled us to mesh Japanese blade designs with modern European styling, resulting into a luxurious work of art, surpassing the mere classification of \"kitchen knives\".",
      "We decided to create two distinct premium knife sets, one fitted with VG10 Titanium coated Premium Japanese steel (The Hisashi Collection) and the other set with AUS10,  67 layer folded Japanese steel (The Shogun Collection). While natural elegance is at the core of our project, we made sure to produce both knife sets with unrivaled quality and edge sharpness and retention. We honored  the traditional Japanese 16 degree sharpened edge, making the blades extremely sharp for the most delicate cuts.",

    "description": "Protect virtually every drain in your home with the most advanced strainers ever created.",
    "company_name": "Serge Karnegie",
    "allParagraphs": [
      "Protect virtually every drain in your home with the most advanced strainers ever created.",
      "Our story began in late 2015 with the launch of our original award-winning TubShroom\u00ae Drain Protector right here on Indiegogo.  We're proud to be protecting nearly 3 million homes from clogged drains, costly plumber visits and--most importantly--toxic liquid chemicals. Now we're back with our fourth Indiegogo campaign to bring you the most-advanced drain protection solutions ever created: The all-new Kitchen SinkShroom\u00ae, the all-new Ultra TubShroom\u00ae, and the all-new StopShroom\u00ae Plug. Let's begin...",
      "The patent-pending Kitchen SinkShroom\u00ae borrows from much of the same technology found in our original TubShroom\u00ae. To provide superior protection to every drain in the home, we knew we had to tackle the kitchen sink next. Ask yourself the following questions: How many strainers have I gone through in the past couple of years? How easy is it to clean my current strainer? Is my current strainer an eye sore? Does the water continue to back up every time I wash my dishes? How much do I dislike sticking my hand in dirty dish water where sharp knives can be lurking? We addressed all these concerns.",
      "We started with the best materials out there to prevent rusting and to preserve durability. Our stainless steel is made to last the test of time and it looks fabulous in any kitchen. The days of ugly strainers are gone. We've tested compatibility with a vast number of kitchen sink drains out there and the fit was perfect every single time.",
      "We have filled the basket with rice, vegetables, crumbs, garbage, meats--you name it. You could say we threw the kitchen sink at it. No mater how full the basket was, the water continued to flow through the center cylinder holes and the sink remained clog-free. Mission accomplished.",
      "Did we mention how easy it is to clean, even with one hand? Simply grab the center \"Shroom\" cylinder to pull the Kitchen SinkShroom\u00ae out of the drain, then rotate your fingers to the edge before tapping the debris away into the garbage. Many strainers make it unnecessarily difficult to get a hold of the sharp edges when it's time to remove it from the sink. Other strainers are a chore to clean out properly. You know what I'm talking about.",
      "Just look at that beautiful piece of craftsmanship and then visualize the dinky plastic colored strainers we often find littered on store shelves. The soft brushed lines and jet black center cylinder really make our unit pop.",
      "Just keep flowing, just keep flow...ing. Water gets through--food particles don't. When debris gathers in your drain, the result is slowed or clogged drains, smelly sinks, and our favorite little buggers: the infamous fruit flies. All they want is somewhere sweet and damp to lay their eggs in. Won't you be my neighbor? It's time to take back your kitchen.",
      "We've engineered the Kitchen SinkShroom\u00ae to sit perfectly flat in your drain, covering one edge to the other uniformly so that water and food particles face no resistance in making their way into the basket. What's the use of a strainer if garbage and debris remain hanging around around the rim? We've instituted a strict no loitering policy. Kitchen sinks have an indiscernible taper towards the drain opening so that gravity pulls water and food where they need to go. Don't let your strainer be a hindrance to science.",
      "Here's a sneak peak (above) of our work-in-progress retail packaging for the Kitchen SinkShroom\u00ae. The best way to get your product in front of as many people as possible is through traditional retail. If we can make you early-adopters happy with the product this holiday season, we're confident we can do the same for the rest of the market later.",
      "Awwww yis, it's finally here. The latest evolution of our award-winning TubShroom\u00ae drain protector has arrived. We can't begin to tell you how many random TubShroom owners have emailed us, visited us at shows, or just talked to us in person about how much they love their TubShrooms. Sure, we have also released the popular SinkShroom for bathroom sinks, the ShowerShroom for stand-up shower stall drains, and the StopShroom version 1.0 drain cover, but the product we get the most positive feedback for is definitely TubShroom. We want to take this moment to thank each and every one of you who have trusted us with your drains by bringing a 'Shroom product home with you.",
      "We'd like to take a moment to apologize in advance for showing all that hair, but there's no better way than showing exactly how well our patented TubShroom technology works than with a 5-second animated gif. In short, there's a bottom flange that sits inside your drain where all the hair is neatly caught out of sight while the water continues to flow, as it should, through the dozens of strategically placed holes throughout the perfectly-sized cylinder and mushroom head.",
      "So what's so much better about this new version of TubShroom that we're so brazenly calling Ultra TubShroom\u00ae? Our original TubShroom still works fabulously well, as evidenced by the over 15,000+ glowing reviews you can find for it across the internet.  We don't believe one should leave well enough alone. We live, breathe and--sometimes even--dream drain products, you see. We have improved upon nearly every aspect of our original TubShroom.",
      "Our research shows that the vast majority of clogs occur in bathtub drains. Virtually every home in the world has a bathtub drain because that's where people give their kids and pets baths and where they take their showers. The number one cause of clogged drains is long hair. The longer the hair and the more people or pets in the home, the higher the likelihood of clogs. Given all this, we knew we had to optimize our Ultra TubShroom for bathtub drains, first and foremost. From the precise sizing of the cylinder to the placement of each and every hole, we put literally years of testing into this upgrade.",
      "Our original TubShroom requires a crossbar in the drain to sit up properly. While the majority of drains do come with a crossbar, there are some drains out there that lack this feature. The Ultra TubShroom rectifies this with a curved head containing elegant protrusions that prevent the unit from going lower than it should. This means all that hair and water always has a place to go.",
      "Next up, our customers asked for improved durability and longevity. While our original TubShroom could last years with regular cleanings and maintenance, we sometimes heard complaints about soap and mildew buildup. Drains are a dark, damp and nasty place. Mildew buildup is only natural. The Ultra TubShroom has solid stainless steel parts to help address this issue. Cleaning and maintenance has never been easier.",
      "We went back to the drawing board and figured out ways to further improve water flow. No one wants to stand in ankle-high soapy water while showering. We have not only achieved our best flow rate testing to date, we have also ensured that even abnormally shorter or wider drains get great drainage results with the Ultra TubShroom.",
      "As always, hair is caught out of sight and clean-up is a breeze. Now, with Ultra TubShroom, you can go longer (sometimes months instead of weeks) between cleanings. When the cylinder is full of hair, just grab a paper towel or tissue paper and swipe that bundle of hair right off into the trash.",
      "Although our data shows that the vast majority of bathtub drains out there fall in the 1.5\" to 1.75\" range, there is a small percentage of you out there with abnormally-sized drains. That's OK. People come in different shapes and sizes too. So we went the extra mile to include interchangeable adapters that support the most typical 1.5\"-1.75\" drains as well as extra adapters to fit most larger 2\" drains and smaller 1.25\" drains. Optimizing Ultra TubShroom to fit every imaginable bathroom drain out there would mean having to sacrifice on it's superb tub drain performance, so we decided to make the perfect tub drain strainer-- first and foremost--and provide support for most other drains as a secondary bonus.",
      "Last but not least, many of our customers have wanted to be able to take baths by plugging up their drain.  In the past, we recommended using their old stoppers in tandem with TubShroom by swapping them out depending on the need. Now, we've decided to include our all-new patent-pending StopShroom\u00ae Plug with every Ultra TubShroom. Check it out below...",
      "We looked at all the stopper solutions out there and we knew there had to be a better way. Current options include drain covers (we even made one ourselves!), ivory rubber plugs that are not universal, and the removable metal or plastic stoppers that often come with the drains when you move in. They each have their flaws. For example, the built-in ones inevitably start to leak so bath time is a race against the clock. Our StopShroom\u00ae Plug solution is simple yet effective.",
      "The StopShroom Plug is made out of 100% durable, BPA-free silicone, so it can take a beating from those harsh drain conditions and keep on ticking. Our design was inspired by the cork concept you find in various bottles. The precise sizing, the angularity, and the graduated rings all combine to form a product that works really, really well. It's may not be as sexy as the other new releases, but it truly gets the job done like a boss.",
      "The StopShroom Plug is compatible with virtually all bathtub drains (the typical size ranging from 1.5\" to 1.75\") and bathroom sink drains (the typical size ranges from 1\" to 1.25\") and everything in between. We even made it is so it can work with slightly larger and smaller drains.",
      "It's easy to use. Just push down with a bit of force until the StopShroom Plug comes to rest. The ring just inside the drain forms a tight inner seal while the ring that's just outside the drain opening repels water from the outside. It's tag-team, baby.",
      "Whenever it's time to take a bath or shave, place your StopShroom Plug in the drain before filling things  up. Once you're done and ready to drain the tub or sink, pull the StopShroom Plug out and quickly replace it with your Ultra TubShroom (or other relevant 'Shroom product) and voil\u00e0, you're protected. Virtually all built-in stoppers can be popped out or unscrewed and removed.",
      "In late 2015, Juka Innovations Corporation was started in Glen Cove, NY by Serge Karnegie and Solyman Najimi--two long-time friends. Serge and his wife, Elena, were fed up with their ever-clogging bath tub drains. You see, the couple have two young daughters and multiple pets in their apartment, so it was no surprise that their drains clogged so often. Serge perfected his original TubShroom design and, along with the help of Solyman, the duo brought it to the masses via a Indiegogo campaign, which turned out to be the launchpad the fledgling company needed to go on to become the leader in drain protection that it is today. Here's some words from Serge:",
      "Dear backers,",
      "Some of you have been with us since our very first project launched in 2015, and some of you will join the \"Shroom\" family for the first time. Regardless, we are very thankful for your support and trust in the quality of our products. Thank to our early adapters, our original TubShroom was born, eventually becoming the #1 best-seller on Amazon and at many major big box retail stores. We're proud to say that since the launch in 2016, we have helped to protect close to 3 million drains worldwide.",
      "We must say that there were a few bumps on the road. Inventory shortages, shipping delays, intellectual property battles, and more. We have had to learn the ins and outs of plumbing, drainage, and design. Furthermore, we have visited many countries around the world to compare and analyze drain types. Our goal is to protect every drain in your home and with the launch of this Indiegogo campaign, we feel we have gotten that much closer. Our team's focus is on producing innovative products that are save people money, that solve real-world problems, and that look great.",
      "Thank you for taking this journey with us. We promise to do our utmost to continue to provide amazing products and terrific support. Please reach out to us at support@tubshroom.com with any questions you have on our previous products or for any topic you have not seen covered in this campaign.",

      "The Kitchen SinkShroom works in virtually all kitchen sink drains, which are typically about 3.25\" wide. The Ultra TubShroom works in virtually all bathtub drains (typical tub drain sizes range from 1.5\" to 1.75\" wide). Adapters are included with Ultra TubShroom to allow it to also fit most 1.25\" and 2\" wide drains. StopShroom Plug fits in virtually all bathtub and bathroom sink drains. It is not meant for Kitchen sink drains. If you grab the complete bundle, you may never have to worry about clogged drains again throughout your home.",
      "Where can I go to learn more about your past products?",
      "You can find more information about us and our products at our official page at www.TubShroom.com. You can also check out some of our past Indiegogo campaigns here and here. Here's a piece done by Allure. You might be interested in this recent Forbes article that we were featured in. Lastly, feel free to follow us on Facebook for all our latest updates.",
      "Will these products work in international drains?",
      "The short answer is yes. We have tested our products in many countries such as Canada, Mexico, UK, France, Japan, and more. That's not to say that we can account for every type of drain variation and every country's specific plumbing codes and drain types. We can safely say we have 99.9% compatibility in the USA and Canada and a bit less than that in most developed foreign countries, at least according to our testing, feedback, and data.",
      "Do you ship internationally (outside of the USA)?",
      "We do ship internationally to all countries. Travel time will vary, naturally. Please note that you may be responsible for duties, fees and taxes applicable to your region.",
      "What is your warranty and return policy?",
      "We provide a full 3 months no-questions-asked money-back guarantee from the day you receive your package. If you don't love your product(s) and want to return it, all you have to do is reach out. If any defects or issues arise during that period, we will make it right. If you're happy with the products or service you receive from us, we're confident you will help spread the word as our customers have been doing since day one.",
      "Do you have plans for any other types of products?",
      "We always have multiple new projects in the works at any given time. That's what makes this fun. Some will be hits and some may be misses. Millions of gallons of acid-based liquid cleaners have been pours down the world's drains, releasing toxic fumes into homes and stripping piping integrity in the process. Sure, it can help clear out a clog, but the cost to our environment and our collective health is simply not worth it. There are greener ways to clear clogged drains (boiling hot water helps, baking soda helps, and there are reusable snakes out there). And there are more sustainable ways to keep drains clear. That's where we come in.",
      "Kitchen SinkShroom and Ultra StopShroom are nearing completion. All products pictured and demonstrated here were built on our production line. We\u2019re currently ramping up at our factory and are ready to meet the estimated delivery times. We\u2019ve done our very best to forecast demand and create a solid production plan. We\u2019ve learned a lot from the past three years, but sometimes forecasts don\u2019t always hit the mark. Should we miss projections, we\u2019ll let you know why and make it right as quickly as possible.",
      "We\u2019ve built a very capable team who has worked for the past 3 years on all our products. However, material delays and unexpected shortages can occur. If this happens, we\u2019ll be sure to keep you informed and work to quickly solve the problem. Our warehouses have successfully shipped thousands of orders already, including past Indiegogo awards. We're confident in our abilities and we will do our best to deliver great products in a timely manner.",

Import duties and taxes are not covered by this Clover campaign. Customs: Some countries are known for being very slow with customs, and you probably know if you live in one.

We worked tirelessly to be able to solve all the issues of traditional swimwear. Finally we launched through Kickstarter and raised $35k to bring our brand to life. The feedback we received was off the charts! We were convinced we created the perfect trunks. But hen we had a few backers who asked us if we could also add a pocket to protect their valuables. That's when we realized we were indeed missing an important feature. We right away jumped back to the drawing board and brought HARMONQLO 2.0 to life. Hopefully now our shorts will be the perfect solution we've all been waiting for.",

Still, if you wish to exchange your shorts for any reason, we will allow you to do that as long as they have not been used and still have the original tags attached. However, you will just need to cover the 2 way shipping. As we are offering our trunks at an extremely high discounted price exclusively on Kickstarter we won't be able to accept any returns.",

These largely ordinary materials are not often found on espresso machines. But their application shows you don\u2019t need to look far to find design elements that create a dramatically new experience\u2014emotional, practical, or otherwise. The result is a spectacular espresso machine, and an unparalleled conversation piece.",

Anza\u2019s added value comes from its material choices and accessible functionality. AnZa delivers a cafe-quality experience in a fashion unlike any other appliance\u2014truly earning its bit of valuable real estate on your kitchen countertop. The AnZa might not be technically unique, but the design and material choices of the AnZa make it something completely new, a conversation piece that aims to refashion the industry of home espresso machines.",
      "A few years ago, designers at Montaag set out on a creative experiment. What could it look like to treat an appliance like a work of art\u2014without sacrificing quality? Based on the design team\u2019s love of coffee, and our shared office space with an espresso repair shop, the AnZa design process kicked off.",
      "Our team sought inspiration from the many workshops and salvage yards surrounding us in the San Francisco Bay Area. We played endlessly with material, color, and tactility. Ultimately, we landed on product design principles that emphasize honest materials and intuitive functionality.",

      "That is where you, the amazing coffee community comes in. With your support, we can cover our manufacturer payment and bring the AnZa espresso machine to kitchens all over the world. Yes, yours too.",
      "We are ready to hit \u201cgo!\u201d and are now at the final step: securing funds to cover the manufacturing costs.",
      "The AnZa team is comprised of designers from Montaag, a multidisciplinary design consultancy with offices in Berkeley, California and Oslo and Stavanger, Norway. Collectively, we have brought dozens of products to market for both Fortune 500 clients and early stage start-ups. Our consultancy shares space with Kanen Coffee: a full-service espresso repair shop that lent their technical expertise and guidance for the AnZa coffee machine collaboration.",

      "Sleep plays a vital role in good health and well-being throughout your life. The benefits of a good night\u2019s sleep are countless: it\u2019s just as important as eating healthy and exercising. Being well rested allows us to perform at our maximum potential, both physically and mentally. And that's why a pillow choice is really important.",
      "Everyone is built differently. We all have different habits and body types, which means we all have different sleeping needs. Most pillows you find on Amazon will hardly fit your sleeping needs and that's why we created Mio Pillow: the first customizable bed pillow.",
      "We sleep in these 3 positions and each requires a different height to correctly align your back. MIO PILLOW can be adapted to maintain a correct body position all night long. Keep 4 layers if you sleep on a side, remove 1 layer if you sleep on your back or use only 2 layers if you sleep on your stomach.",
      "You have 2 toppers to use. The first topper is made of Thermofresh, a highly transpirant material that transmits moisture away and keeps your head fresh during a hot summer night. The second is made of Vesna, a low porosity foam that provides a warming action for  cold  winter nights .",

      "MIO PILLOW is made with the best quality of memory foam available on the market and produced by a leading Italian manufacturer.",
      "The material of the pillow is just as resistant as it is soft.  Gently squeeze it to test its qualities.",

      "During tests and focus groups, we found out that many customers complained about the bad odor of the pillow after unpackaging, claiming that this defect often prevents  the use of the pillow itself. When the pillow smells bad,  most often it is because of  the poor quality of memory foam used. Going premium is the solution!",

      "But, in truth, you can hand-make a high-performing mechanical watch for a fraction of the price. Top watch brands keep their master watchmakers and designers from consulting with new brands that dare to break the mold.",
      "But that didn\u2019t stop us.",
      "With the help of a master watchmaker and a team of designers, we created Salut Monde Mechanical Skeleton Watch, the most Affordable Handmade Mechanical Watch on the market.",
      "To ensure you get the product before Christmas, we have pre-assembled 300 Salut Monde Mechanical Skeleton Watch and have them ready for you. Some people have received their Salut Monde! Are you still waiting?",
      "The design and development cycle of each Salut Monde Mechanical Skeleton Watch takes more than 200 days. Each watch has been into more than 4000 production processes before it is ready to be shipped to you. We make sure our products have the less than 0.1% error rate, so your Salut Monde Mechanical Skeleton Watch can be dependable for decades.",
      "With the idea of Globe in mind, Salut Monde Mechanical Skeleton Watch displays all the time zone in the world, The 2 crowns represents the axis of the Earth rotation, The Earth rotates once in 24 hours, the watch can show you the time of 24 hours.  The skeleton design allows you easily see the process of self-winding",
      "Salut Monde Mechanical Skeleton Watch was one of Winners of the Hongkong Watch & Clock Design Competition, and also was one of the Invitees to the 2017 Swiss Basel World Show.",
      "Watch owners expect their watches to work flawlessly without servicing or interfering with them for many years. This is why we hand assemble each of Salut Monde Mechanical Skeleton Watch.",
      "We have created a revolutionary production system that has allowed the techniques of our top Swiss watchmaker to be passed to multiple skilled workers. This allows more workers to help creating top-quality watches at a faster rate, in turn, lowers the price.",
      "Solid watch deserves solid case. Each watch comes with a solid wood watch case, which makes it the great gift in this special holiday season.",
      "If you know someone who needs a well-designed affordable mechanical watch, it is time to have them check Salut Monde right now! For every contribution you referred, you get 5% OFF CASH BACK!",

It made me realise how convenient a wrist torch would be for so many activities. I put pen to paper and started developing ALVA, a micro-LED rechargeable torch for your wrist or ankle that can be used for cycling, running, outdoor activities, and even DIY projects!",

This leads to countless injuries and fatalities.\n\n And in the case of hard braking\u2014which happens much more often than accidents\u2014slowing down from 45 to 20mph in two seconds throws an unprotected dog forward with a force equal to its own weight, causing trauma and injury especially in small dogs.\n\nIn either case, most existing devices couldn\u2019t prevent injuries and fatalities\u2014but Wuffguard can.",
      "The majority of available car seats for dogs fall into two categories: flimsy baskets requiring a harness (can\u2019t accommodate medium dogs) and harness-based devices for the back seat (can\u2019t accommodate smaller dogs).\n\n Wuffguard is the safe, comfortable option that works better than both the harness or the flimsy basket.",
      "Wuffguard has a unique, patent-pending design with a range of science-based features that work in perfect harmony to save lives.",
      "With Wuffguard, set-up is easy and takes less than a minute every time, so you and your furry best friend can get where you need to go ASAP.",
      "Did pup take a dive in the lake? No pawblem. Wuffguard is water-resistant, and our waterproof Pup-Proof Lining accessory can hold up to a gallon of water!",
      "Stricter laws are starting to be implemented across the world concerning dog car safety, with an increasing number of US states charging drivers hefty fines under distracted driving laws. Some states have banned unrestrained dogs in the front seat or altogether, and so has the UK. Countries including Germany and Canada are following suit.\n \nAs this trend continues, keeping your dog safe during car rides will no longer be a question of morality and choice, but also of legal and financial consequences.",
      "The unexpected strikes fast, and it can get really expensive even faster. You might find that your pet insurance is less than helpful\u2014in fact, they\u2019ll deny your claim if your pup was unrestrained\u2014or that you have to pay large sums out of pocket.",
      "This could be financially devastating. The average cost of an emergency vet bill is $800-$1500, and surgery after a car accident can rack up $10,000 in medical bills with the vet\u2014easily.\n\n And that\u2019s if you\u2019re lucky and your dog stands a chance\u201412.5% of car accidents are fatal to the dog involved.",
      "There\u2019s no comparison to Wuffguard when it comes to safety, comfort, and freedom. Your furry friend will be safe and cozy, and you can chat and enjoy the scenery together, next to each other.",
      "The Wuffguard team is business experience, creativity, and a deep love of animals\u2014all wrapped up in one pup-approved package.",
      "Wuffguard\u2019s inventor, Kurban, was on a 4-year work assignment in Kenya and his youngest daughter Sabrina was having a hard time adjusting to their new life there\u2014a world away from their home in Canada.\n\n In a stroke of luck, Kurban\u2019s coworker\u2019s American Eskimo had a litter of puppies, and Kurban decided that a new furry family member would brighten up the family\u2019s African adventure.",
      "When Kurban arrived at his coworker\u2019s farm one day, a wet, dirty lump came wobbling towards him. It was Momo, looking for her forever home\u2014and love at first sight for Kurban.",
      "What a surprise Sabrina got when she opened the car door after school that day to find a tiny, dirty farm puppy looking up at her with big eyes! After a thorough, loving bath, Momo went from brown to white, transforming into a gorgeous dog who would become an important member of the family\u2014which she\u2019s been for nine great years now.",
      "The family eventually moved back to Canada and Momo\u2019s truly loving life there\u2014as playful as that wet, dirty puppy, but dry and warm in cozy sweaters in Spring, Autumn, and Winter (she has yet to acclimate to the cold weather!)",
      "Kurban and his family took Momo everywhere with them, and when it was just her and Kurban, Momo preferred being in the front seat of the car, next to him. But after a major car accident that left Kurban on a walker and crutches for three months, he realized that, had Momo been with him, she would have been killed.\n\n Kurban immediately began researching car seats for dogs but wasn\u2019t able to find one that accommodated small to medium-sized dogs in the front seat. Thus, Wuffguard was born\u2014out of a desire to keep Momo, and other dogs like her, safe and happy.",
      "We\u2019ve gone through many technical enhancements and various prototypes before reaching the current version of Wuffguard. Here are some of the steps we've taken to ensure that Wuffguard is the safest solution on the market:\n\n 1) Our first prototype had no padding, no crumple zone, aluminum front posts, and an aluminum bar. From the aluminum bar, the idea of a crumple zone came up.",
      "2) Next, we included a plastic bar that would bend or break after 240 pounds of force shock absorption.",
      "3) We decreased the gaps in Wuffguard\u2019s webbing to accommodate smaller dogs.",
      "4) We made Wuffguard more secure by extending the back and side height and angling the sides to make it harder for a dog to jump out.",
      "5) We improved shock absorption by adding padding to the front of Wuffguard and by adding elasticity to the webbing.",
      "6) We created the Pup-Proof lining, which protects car seats from muddy paws and accidental spills.",
      "7) We created the Wooftastic Netting that keeps hard-to-restrain dogs safely secure in Wuffguard.",
      "8) For our latest version, we created a restraint system: the Safety Clip Cord, which is long enough to allow a dog to reach the front of Wuffguard but no further.",
      "We\u2019re confident that our Wuffguard manufacturing and shipping timeline takes into account all foreseeable factors. However, in any manufacturing process, unforeseen delays can be a factor. Political instability, natural disasters, or a pandemic resurgence could all cause supply chain issues. Should any risks or challenges arise, our number one priority will be to communicate with you and do everything we can to mitigate the delay. We\u2019re so grateful for your support in this project, and we appreciate you being a part of our mission to save dogs\u2019 lives via safer car travel.",

      "Earn cash with fun product trivia",
      "Introducing Quizziu - a revolutionary mobile app poised to redefine how brands connect with consumers, and how individuals discover new products and services.",
      "In today's noisy digital landscape, traditional ads are boring for consumers, and for brands, cutting through the monotony to achieve meaningful engagement is an ongoing challenge.",
      "Quizziu offers a fresh, dynamic solution: we're transforming boring ads into engaging trivia that pays users to learn about brands.",
      "\"At its core, Quizziu is a mobile app that incentivizes users to learn about products and services through engaging trivia questions. It's a win-win ecosystem designed to benefit both brands and consumers in a powerful new way.\"",
      "\"For users, Quizziu is simple and fun. They open the app and see a variety of trivia questions, each clearly linked to a specific product or service and offering a tangible cash incentive for a correct answer \u2013 ranging from a dime to a dollar.",
      "The interface is intuitive, and categorized by industry for easy navigation. When a user taps a question, they get one shot to answer correctly. This single attempt, coupled with an optional 'Learn More' link that directs them to the brand's website or a concise product summary, encourages focused engagement and genuine learning. Correct answers are instantly congratulated and the user is prompted to submit a brief feedback comment to get rewarded with credits to their in-app wallet, which can be cashed out via popular platforms like PayPal and Venmo once a small threshold is reached. We've also built in robust anti-cheat measures to ensure the integrity of the system.\"",
      "\"For brands, Quizziu offers a cost-effective and highly engaging marketing solution that goes far beyond traditional advertising. Instead of hoping users passively absorb information, brands actively incentivize them to learn key product features and benefits. They set their campaign parameters \u2013 budget, target audience, and incentive per question \u2013 and our platform handles the rest. Our team crafts compelling trivia questions designed to highlight crucial selling points. Brands only pay when a user answers correctly, ensuring that every dollar spent translates to active engagement with their message.",
      "Furthermore, Quizziu provides valuable analytics, including response rates, demographic breakdowns, and click-through rates to 'Learn More' links, offering actionable insights into campaign performance and consumer understanding.\"",
      "\"Quizziu stands out for several key reasons",
      "* Engagement Over Boredom: We replace the drudgery of ads with the fun and reward of trivia, significantly boosting user participation.",
      "* Learning Through Incentives: The one-chance rule and the 'Learn More' option actively encourage users to learn about products, leading to better brand recall and understanding.",
      "* Cost-Effective Marketing: Brands achieve high engagement at a low cost per impression, paying only for users who actively interact with their information.",
      "* Measurable Impact: Our platform provides detailed analytics, allowing brands to track their ROI and gain valuable consumer insights.",
      "* Scalability and Flexibility: Quizziu can accommodate campaigns of all sizes, targeting niche or broad audiences with adjustable budgets and incentives.\"",
      "\"Our revenue model is multi-faceted and designed for sustainable growth. We primarily charge brands a platform fee \u2013 a percentage of their total campaign budget \u2013 to cover question creation, distribution, and analytics. We also envision opportunities for premium brand services, such as advanced targeting and custom question formats.",
      "\"While we are in the pre-launch phase, the initial concept has generated significant interest in market validation.",
      "Looking ahead, we see immense potential for Quizziu to evolve. We plan to incorporate features like social sharing for viral growth, augmented reality integrations for in-store engagement, and loyalty programs to reward consistent participation.",
      "Ultimately, Quizziu aims to become the go-to platform for product discovery in the digital age, bridging the gap between effective marketing and genuinely informed consumers.\"",
      "\"Quizziu isn't just another game app; it's a dynamic marketing and learning platform with a unique value proposition for both users and brands. We believe it has the potential to disrupt traditional advertising and create a powerful new channel for product discovery.",

      "Watch the video to check out the 9to5mac hands-on review of the Infinity Cable.",
      "This is the Chargeasap Infinity Cable. The world's first cable to support 100W USB-C PD and be cross-device compatible with all 3 major USB types making it the world's first truly universal USB cable compatible with all phones, tablets and USB-C PD devices including laptops.",
      "Tripping over and breaking your laptop is a thing of the past, with our Mag-safe connector bringing back the snag-free feature giving you peace of mind.",
      "Start your day with ease and peace of mind with our Yank-Safe connection.",
      "We've spent the last 4 years redesigning the USB cable to finally create one powerful enough to work with all USB devices supporting micro USB, Apple, USB-C as well as the biggest device in your arsenal, USB-C laptops. Not only can the Infinity Cable support QC 3.0 & 4.0, but for the first time ever, it can support Power Delivery charging up to 100W. No kidding, we really have been working on this for 4 years, you can see all the previous iterations down below in the story section. We're really stoked to finally bring this vision to life with your help!",
      "Connecting to your phone during difficult situations without pausing what you're doing has never been easier, such as driving on-the-go.",
      "Busy getting things done? Connect hassle free with just one hand. Our cables feature a reversible magnetic connection which means instant connection every single time. No more fumbling around to connect your devices, even in the dark.",
      "Have you ever left your phone to charge overnight but wake up to find the battery dead? We've listened to customer feedback and brought back our original LED light function for the Infinity Cable which only turns on when your device has been connected and is successfully charging. The UNO cable LED light would always be on when connected to a power source, regardless if the device was successfully connected. This indicator will eliminate incidents where you've left your device to charge but it hasn't even been connected properly.",
      "Please note: When you plug the Infinity cable into the Type A adapter and into a Type A power source, the light will turn on already before connecting to the device due to USB cable configurations,. Without the adapter the light will only turn on once the device is connected to the power source and the device.",
      "Each Infinity cable set features 2x N54 grade neodymium magnets which are the world's strongest commercial grade magnets. We really mean it when we say we're using the world's strongest magnets. They're even strong enough to hold an iPad Air which is 437g (0.96lb)! These are the same magnets that have been sold to over 100,000 customers since 2016 so the unparalleled quality and durability of them sets us apart from other brands.",
      "Since the inception of our UNO cable, we have upgraded the magnetic strength of our new cables which includes Infinity cable. This is through incorporating an innovative locking mechanism, giving your cable a stronger connection and longer lifespan. This stronger magnetic strength means it can support a longer cable. Each cable set comes with a 1.2m (3.9ft) cable with an optional 2m (6.5ft) and 40cm (1.3ft) cable sold separately. We've also improved the connectivity lifespan of the older cables from 30,000 to 40,000 connections. Means a longer lasting cable that will outlast all your devices.",
      "With the invention of USB, you\u2019ve been forced to carry at least 3 different cables for all your devices. But with that comes, tangled cables, compatibility issues and just a whole heap of mess our fast paced lives just don't have time for. USB Stands for Universal Serial Bus. So we thought, why not make a USB cable the way it should be- truly universal.",
      "We're serious when we say 1 cable for your phones, tablets and USB devices. Our 3 connectors (Lightning, Micro USB & USB-C) are designed to be compatible with all your modern devices from headphones to Nintendo Switch, E-Cigs, GoPro the list is endless. What sets Infinity on a league on it's own is that is also works with USB-C laptops, and we mean ALL laptops including Macbook Air and Macbook Pro.",
      "The Infinity Cable is capable of 2-way full speed USB 2.0 data transfer at 480 Mbps between any USB devices. It's also capable of 100W PD charge, something very few magnetic cables can achieve and certainly the first in the world that's also compatible with lightning and micro USB tips. You can see below that the Infinity cable is matching the same max charge speed of the original Apple cable.",
      "Each cable comes with a complimentary cord wrap, convenient for adjusting the length of the cable or quickly wrapping the cable away for neat and tidy storage or transportation. Say goodbye to messy and tangled cables forever.",
      "We've also reduced the brightness of the LED light at the request of previous backers. This is done through 2 changes, firstly an ideal hole size of 0.8mm and secondly a darker plastic material to dim the light. This means you can still easily find your cable in the dark with minimal ambient light keeping you up at night.",
      "Regular cables don't even last a few years (and if you're an iPhone owner you'll know it doesn't even last 6 months!) Infinity cables replace all your USB charging cables and are backed with a 15 year warranty saving you a ton of money.  For the first time we're increasing the warranty period for our Infinity Cable from the standard 1 year you find with most cable brands to our premium 15 year warranty. With our improved materials and machinery process, we believe we've designed a cable to last longer than the next 15 years! This is an international warranty that we will honor on any Infinity cables sold worldwide.",
      "The Infinity Cable is made out of 9T which is a more temperature resistant material compared to the LCP plastic which is found on most other cables including our older asap Connect and asap X-Connect cable ranges. The end result is a cooler to touch cable, particularly during use with QC3.0, QC4.0 and PD charging. This means the cables are less likely to be worn out by heat over time.",
      "The Infinity cable is made from quality material including military grade tangle free nylon. Thicker cables allow for extra currents, which means a faster charge. That's why we've improved the wire thickness from 22AWG (for UNO) to 18AWG for Infinity which means increasing the diameter of the cable from 3.3mm to 4mm to be able to support functionality of QC3.0 , QC4.0 as well as Power Delivery up to 100W.",
      "Infinity cables will also incorporate 4x 3000D nylon braids to reinforce the strength of the cable. We've put the Infinity Cables through a bend test machine, being the cable at least 15,000 times, 180 degrees to ensure it can last through all your rigorous daily usage.",
      "The Infinity Cable features an anti-fray neck, meaning your cables have increased durability and less chance of fraying or snapping at the most common weak point. This anti-fray neck design significantly increases the lifespan of the cable handling everyday wear and tear.  Since UNO, we've increased the anti-fray neck to a slightly larger and more durable size without compromising the magnetic strength.",
      "Each Infinity cable set comes with a bonus tip removal tool in a new sleek black colour which allow you to remove the tip from all your devices with ease. Please note that this tool isn't required as the tip can be easily removed with your fingers, though some people prefer using it for phones with cases or devices with depressed USB holes such as a GoPro.",
      "An often overlooked feature of magnetic cables is that it will protect your phone port from dust and dirt entering. By leaving the tip in there, it will also extend the life of your phone port from the normal wear and tear of cables being inserted and pulled out on a daily basis.",
      "Over the years we've received suggestions from our customers that we should offer a cable case to store their tips. We always thought this was a great idea so we've designed a case where you can conveniently store all your cables, tips and other accessories. Add it to your order for an exclusive Indiegogo price of $10 and never misplace a tip again! Better yet, we're throwing in a complimentary case with every cable set when you support the triple pack reward tier or greater.",
      "Introducing for the first time our new magnetic stays. This is our version of a cord holder which is designed specifically for magnetic cables, keeping your cables in place even when you unplug and go. These magnetic stays hold your cords securely and allow you to keep cords organized and your work space clear. With a reusable 3M backing, stick it on any surface such as your office desk or car dashboard and move it when you want to re-arrange your working/living area. Available as an add-on for an exclusive Indiegogo price of 4 for $12.",
      "As power delivery technology requires USB-C, all Infinity cables have a USB-C end that plugs into your power source. This is different from the typical USB Type-A end that many standard cables usually come with. We understand that some of your devices still use a USB Type-A port so to ensure we don't exclude any of them we're offering a Indiegogo exclusive Type A USB adapter as an optional add-on for only $5. This adapter is compatible with our Infinity cable, previous cable ranges UNO & MAGX as well as all USB-C cables. This adapter will also convert your existing Type A ports into one that can support USB-C headphones which can now plug directly into your laptop.",
      "Also for the first time we're releasing our own line of USB-C wall charger and car chargers that can charge high powered devices simultaneously and support the max power of the Infinity Cable. We want you all to be able to incorporate the Infinity Cable seamlessly into your daily lives and future proof your home.",
      "120W USB-C Laptop & QC 3.0 Charger: Exclusive Indiegogo price of $75 (RRP $128) saving 41%",
      "48W USB-C Car Charger: Exclusive Indiegogo price of $19 (RRP $44) saving 57%",
      "As phones begin to become more advanced and are an essential to daily life, one of the most important features we consider is how long it will take for your phone to charge up. We're always on the move, so who has the time to stand around waiting for their device to charge up?",
      "Power delivery (PD) phones such as the Pixel 4, S10+ 5G or the Note 11+ which can charge up to 45W is more than 3x faster than non-PD phones. This is much faster than wireless charging which is limited to only 5-15W max currently. E.g. the iPhone X only wireless charges at 7.5W, which is 6x slower than the Note 11+. Wireless charge speeds have a long way to catch-up to PD, something we just don't have time for today in our busy lives. All future phones will incorporate PD technology. So if you want to utilize the fast charging feature of your phone, this can only be achieved through charging with a cable that is PD compatible.",
      "Please note: Infinity Cable is a huge technological feat in being the world's first cable to support PD 100W and be cross-device compatible with all 3 tip types. Due to the upgraded 10 pin design, the cables are unfortunately not backwards compatible with the older 5 pin ranges (asap Connect, asap X-Connect, UNO, MAGX).",
      "We've been around since 2016, launched 5 campaigns and shipped to thousands of happy customers, who have become loyal supporters.",
      "Many phone companies have started to release their own proprietary \"fast charge technology\" with many of their newer flagship devices. Please refer to the table above to see if your device can use third party cables to access it's special charging technology. Devices with their own proprietary charging technology are only compatible with their proprietary and official cables and not third party cables to achieve their full charge speeds. Using Infinity, the cable will still charge at the max speed possible without integrating in their proprietary charge technology.",
      "You can add additional cable sets, cables, tips and other items we have on offer to your order by adding in the extra value of the items. Don't fret if you make a mistake or want to add more to your order later as you will be emailed a survey from BackerKit 14 days after your purchase, asking you to choose your options. Any new purchases from the BackerKit survey will no extra shipping charge and you will be offered the discounted rate per add on if you purchased a special or volume perk (for example if you purchased a reward where cables sets were $28, then all additional cable sets are $28). You will have 14 business days to complete your survey from the day you receive it. If you have any questions after the survey has arrived please email help@chargeasap.com and the Customer Happiness Team will respond within 48 business hours.",
      "All previous Chargeasap products have been granted the following international certifications to meet quality manufacturing standards and sound environmental practices. Infinity Cable will also be applying to receive these certifications before shipping.",
      "Chargeasap is a consumer electronics startup originating from Sydney with a global team who believe users should be the creators and innovators of products.

      "Whether you're at home, at the office, or out in the great outdoors, Sitpack ZEN is designed to help you maintain perfect posture wherever life takes you. This truly ergonomic, height-adjustable chair allows you to relax in comfort while staying aligned, supporting your body\u2019s natural posture.",
      "We've taken our signature design and your valuable feedback to heart to create a chair that's not only ultra-portable but also incredibly functional. With key upgrades in comfort, durability, and usability, the new Sitpack Zen is the chair you've been waiting for!\nDesigned to meet the needs of adventurers, outdoor enthusiasts, and anyone on the go, the new Sitpack Zen is perfect for those who value both convenience and functionality.",
      "We\u2019ve listened closely to your feedback from our previous Zen campaign, and we\u2019re excited to share how we\u2019ve turned your input into meaningful improvements.",
      "\"The Y-Shape of the ZEN is the perfect angle to suspend a seat that is ergonomically designed to adopt each user. The \"hammock\" shaped seat provides both optimal comfort and flexibility\"",
      "We used materials made of recycled plastic to increase the seat size for greater comfort. We added a luxurious memory foam quilted seat.",

      "These details not only highlight your products' functionality but also demonstrate the thought and expertise that have gone into their development.",

      "The Original Zen's foot mount had some challenges, but we've addressed this by reinforcing it with an aluminum insert, providing unparalleled stability in any situation. This enhanced design ensures it\u2019s stronger than ever.",
      "Previous backers will be able to purchase the new and improved foot, how ever it does require some installation skill. Guide will follow.",
      "A lot of our Zen backers pointed out that  was the lack of storage options for Zen. There were no carry case and no pocket, so Zen users have been using socks for easier storage. Finally with this new integrated pocket Zen socks are now completly redundant.",
      "With our brand-new \"button\" addition to the seat, packing up has never been easier. Simply use the button as leverage to lift the seat off the aluminum wings after loosening the seat straps and pushing down the ring.

      "We\u2019ve thoroughly reviewed the adjustable chairs available today, and there\u2019s still nothing quite like the Sitpack Zen. Since our launch in 2015, there have been virtually no options for high-seated, portable seating. However, after introducing Sitpack and achieving global sales, the market saw an explosion of seating solutions. Yet, even now, nothing matches the design of the Sitpack Zen X\u2014it's never even been copied. Why? Because it\u2019s an incredibly challenging product to make, arguably one of the most demanding seating constructions ever created.",
      "In our view, only one other chair on the market embodies the innovation and functionality that portable seating should deliver.",
      "You can use the Sitpack ZEN for commuting, going to the kids' football match, hiking, trekking, and more!",
      "If you backed our initial Zen campaing or go back and read about it you will find that we did have a ton of issues with our first partner B2B Link China. I will not go into detail, but the company was not mature to take on a project like Zen that requires so much detail. After things went south, we moved our molds to 3 other factories for testing, non of the factories where able to make a a fully automated production, as the molds was in such a bad state, that each part needed manual processing.",
      "To bring these improvements to life, we\u2019ve partnered with the reputable company Shinning Way Sourcing, renowned for their commitment to quality and innovation.",
      "This collaboration has enabled us to address every issue from the previous model with precision and care. From the enhanced locking mechanism to the reinforced foot mount, every component has been rigorously tested to meet the highest standards.",
      "With this partnership, we\u2019re confident that the new Sitpack Zen not only exceeds expectations but also sets a new benchmark for portable seating.",

Most of us like to carry extra SD cards to increase the memory. For travelers, we also carry an extra or two SIM cards to the countries that we like to go. The problem is we just don't have a right place to store these tiny cards. If we throw them into a wallet, we will run into the risk of losing them whenever we open the wallet. If we put them in a bag, they become so bulky. This is why we invented CardGear Slim. It is the minimalist way to carry and organize extra SD and sim cards.

      "The RIMIT Kit allows you to rim up your favourite cocktails anywhere, anytime in seconds!",
      "We want to thank you so much for taking the time to check out our kickstarter.",
      "My name is Rob Cox , I am the Founder and President of RIMIT. People ask me all the time, \"How did you come up with this idea?\" The honest truth is, one day in August 2018, I woke up at 3am and the exact vision of what RIMIT is today was in my head. My guess would be after years of suffering from drinking Caesars from a can without rimmer, the universe worked its magic and gave me the solution to my problem.",
      "Although my background had been in the Landscaping industry for the previous 15 years, I had always been an entrepreneur, owning  businesses in different categories such as a Real estate Investing in Canada and Nicaragua, Granite Counter Tops and few others so I knew extensive research was needed to determine if we should pursue the idea of RIMIT. We quickly realized there may just be a high demand for RIMIT. The problem that we solved with RIIMIT wasn\u2019t just so that consumers could now add rimmer to there canned cocktails but they could now enjoy a fully rimmed cocktails anywhere, anytime in just seconds. And they can do this without their lips having to come in contact with germ covered cans.",
      "But RIMIT was just the beginning. We quickly discovered that there was another problem that we needed to solve. In order to be able to enjoy a fully rimmed cocktail anywhere, anytime in just seconds, the lime juice and rimmer needs to be readily available. It just takes too much time and makes too much mess to have to get out the bowls, rimmer, lime juice and pour them into the bowls just to rim up a couple of cocktails. Then once your done, you now have rimmer and lime juice that both go to waste and you have dishes to do.",
      "The Solution was The RIMIT Kit. Our patent pending 2 in 1 compact, leak-proof rimmer kit allows you to rim up your cocktails anywhere, anytime in just seconds.",
      "The idea of The RIMIT Kit was born just a couple months after RIMIT but The RIMIT Kit needed about 18 months of R&D to get it just perfect. The original thought of The RIMIT Kit would be a small compact 2 in 1 rimmer kit that could fit in your pocket and would only be compatible with the RIMIT. After 18 months of R&D, it was clear that we had to make it just big enough to be compatible with any standard household drinking glass and of course, RIMIT. But it still had to be compact, leak-proof and easily transportable. Not like the standard bar top rimmer trays. So we ended up with this!",
      "Our patent and Trade Mark pending products both RIMIT and The RIMIT Kit were invented to provide more convenience and a quicker solution for preparing fully rimmed cocktails anywhere, anytime in just seconds. All of our products are Made with FDA approved polypropylene, they are BPA Free, Dish Washer Friendly, Recyclable but more importantly they are Reusable. We encourage our customers to wash and reuse our products to minimize waste.",
      "The RIMIT Kit comes with 130 Grams of co-branded Lucky\u2019s Rim Job Rimmer. All you have to do is add 1 ounce of lime juice to the lime juice compartment. The RIMIT Kit can be easily transported via cooler bags, back packs, purses ect. It loves to be stored in the fridge to keep the lime juice fresh.",
      "In todays busy world, there never seems to be enough time in a day. To us, it makes more sense to spend less time preparing cocktails and creating dishes and spend more time enjoying your favorite cocktails with friends and family.",
      "So whether your looking to enjoy a Caesar, Michelada, Margarita, Bloody Mary at home, at the cottage, the beach, camping, golfing or backyard get togethers, RIMIT and The RIMIT Kit allows you to conveniently enjoy fully rimmed cocktails in just seconds.",
      "We officially launched RIMIT in August 2019 and sales plus co-branded partnerships have taken off for us including a collaboration with Mott\u2019s Clamato Caesar\u2019s. Now it is time to introduce The RIMIT Kit. We have already selected our Manufacturer and our moulds are currently being fabricated. We are on schedule to be in full production by the middle of August this year and now we need your help to get our first manufacturing run off the ground so please back this campaign so we can launch The RIMIT Kit and Elevate your cocktail experience.",

      "While we are extremely proud of the original EverRatchet, we know how important it is to our community to continuously innovate and improve.  You asked. We Listened. Based on your feedback we have added new features to EverRatchet that we think you will really enjoy.",
      "Our First EverRatchet Campaign",
      "I am Brian Filko, a mechanical engineer/entrepreneur from Pennsylvania back for my 6th crowdfunding campaign. I have carried many different types of multitools on my keys over the years and have always been frustrated with their ability to tighten and loosen screws.  The constant lifting and repositioning of these tools/bits to only get a quarter turn makes these multitools generally impractical for most common fixes. I decided to channel my frustrations by designing a dynamic ratchet so you don't need to lift and reposition the tool between each turn on your small and large fixes.",
      "We created a one-of-a-kind dynamic ratchet beam that holds the bit in place while turning but flexes to allow the tool to rotate back to its starting position. To tighten a screw, put the bit into the ratchet and turn it back and forth like a normal ratchet.  To loosen a screw, just flip the tool over and rotate in the other direction.",
      ".",
      "Left Image: Tighten, Right Image: Loosen",
      "On EverRatchet Clip we have made upgrades in the following areas:",
      "We really wanted to make EverRatchet Clip as minimalistic as possible. We accomplished this by removing the two bands which held the bit in place on the first tool. The side catches paired with the flexible dynamic beam are engineered to apply just the right amount of force to keep the bit in place but allow easy removal when needed.",
      "The bit being removed and replaced. The dynamic ratchet beam pushes down on the bit while the side catches ensure it is cradled and securely held in place.",
      "We are upping our game and moving from grade 2 to the highly desired grade 5 titanium.",
      "The addition of a pocket clip allows you to easily hook the tool on to your pants, bag or add to your keychain. The no pass channel on the pocket clip was designed to ensure the keyrings do not pass through it to give you an alternative way to carry,",
      "We have made it easier to seat the tool on a variety of corner case bottle caps by increasing the radii on the leading and increasing the angle of the attack allow a better grip and additional leverage.",
      "With the upgrade to grade 5 titanium, we have increased the rated torque for the ratchet feature by 25% up to 25 in-lbs. Need additional torque? Use the static 1/4\" wrench feature to loosen a stubborn screw and then swap over to the ratchet to complete the task.",
      "Based on customer feedback, we have improved the design to make sure the bit does not slip out of the tool when reaching into a hard to access area.",

      "Below we detail out all the steps the tool goes through to be transformed from raw titanium into the EverRatchet Clip:",
      "Wire Electrical Discharge Manufacturing (EDM) - A high-precision robot moves an electrified wire electrode about the diameter of a human hair through several sheets of titanium which causes the surrounding metal to vaporize leaving a cut in the metal. The path is takes is specified by the engineering models and drawings. This process is used to cut the outline of the tool body, to cut the interior static \u00bc\u201d driver and dynamic driver areas.  Then the tool is repositioned on its side to cut the box opener/score tool.",
      "Sinker EDM -  To create the side catches we added second EDM process. A high-precision robot pulses an electrified pad into inner wall of the tool. This vaporizes the metal under the cut-out for the side catches to create the space for the bit to be secured under the catch. The position and depth of the feature is specified by the engineering models and drawings.",
      "Tumbling -  The tools are then placed in a vibrating bowl filled with deburring media to remove the sharp edges on metal parts.",
      "Blasting - Next, a machine applies our special glass blast finish. This process is used to apply the surface finish to the tool. EverRatchet Clip will be featuring our latest glass applied finish to keep it nice and new every time you reach for it.",
      "Lasering -  Finally, a CNC gantry laser etches graphics on to the tool. This process is used to apply the EverRatchet Clip name and functional markings to the tool",
      "Assembly/Packaging - We do a final inspection prior to packaging the unit with a blister-packaging machine.",

      "Say GOODBYE to feeling sweaty & smelly with world's most breathable outdoor gear - MADE IN EU boots!",
      "While delivering life-saving medicines to remote communities around the world, Kapil Dev Singh realized that his \"high-end\", waterproof gear was making him sweaty & uncomfortable in the hot & humid conditions. Challenged by the discomfort, and inspired by the zest for life he saw in these communities, Kapil started Mishmi Takin to make gear so breathable that it could work even in high humidity conditions. Since our products BREATHE better even in challenging, rainy and humid environments (like Seattle, London and Tampa), they OUT-PERFORM in other more colder or drier environments also - like in New Hampshire, Utah or Southern California!",
      "Mishmi Takin boots and jackets focus on enhanced user comfort by maximizing air exchange between the inside of the gear and the outside. Ventilation-focused product design, highly breathable, air permeable eVent fabrics, and Vibram Megagrip rubber, give our Footwear and Jackets the power to keep you comfortable in hot, cold, humid, soggy, or any WET conditions \u2026 yes, even SWEATY conditions.",
      "Our products are ideal for:",
      "As you may have noticed by now, we have many ways to customize our products to be perfect for each user. Do not feel pressured to choose your specifics right now. Simply claim the shoe or jacket style you want from the perks listed in the sidebar, and after our campaign we will contact you with a survey to determine your exact size and preferences.",
      "Read the entire Outdoor Journal Review",
      "Click here for the Full Review >>",
      "Almost all hiking boots (and most shells) on the market today feature a 'Wet System\u2019 solid Polyurethane (PU) membrane. For a 'Wet System\u2019 membrane to start working, the temperature and humidity inside the gear must increase first. The increased humidity inside triggers condensation on PU membrane, which is followed by a 3-step process of absorption, diffusion, and then evaporation to pass through the membrane.",
      "This process is painfully SLOW and makes you feel sweaty before beginning to work. So, even in colder and drier climates there is a period of discomfort before the gear starts to breathe. In rain or high humidity, this process shuts down completely because the humidity inside and outside is the same.",
      "Mishmi Takin uses DRY-SYSTEM membranes and fabrics that are micro-porous and air permeable, resulting in expulsion of water vapor in a single-step. This is supplemented by use of multiple, additional physical ventilation features that enhance air exchange and keep you comfortable. No other hiking footwear or jacket offers this level of breath-ability.",
      "In other words: We breathe even in conditions where others don't!",
      "The critical difference between our technology and traditional waterproof and/or breathable fabrics lies in the millions of microscopic pores built into the eVent proprietary membrane that works instantly to vent water vapor that builds up inside your gear. Because of this Direct Venting\u2122 Technology, and unlike others, you don't need to get sweaty for it to start to work. It\u2019s a 'Dry System' that allows eVent fabrics to be fully waterproof and fully breathable \u2013 keeping you dry and comfortable in the widest range of temperatures and conditions.",
      "Developed for the user who frequently encounters slippery surfaces, VIBRAM\u00ae Megagrip is suitable for trekking, multisport, fly fishing, as well as all season hiking and travel. It offers an incomparable combination of grip and durability which helps define VIBRAM\u00ae Megagrip as the ideal high performance rubber compound for extremely demanding activities such as backpacking, canyoneering, enduro-mountain biking and skate boarding.",
      "Our idea for an outdoor brand grew from our Founder Kapil Dev Singh\u2019s experiences delivering medicines and hiking in his native India as well as Liberia, West Africa. While in the tropical forests of Eastern Himalayas and West Africa, he realized that he couldn\u2019t find boots or outerwear that worked properly in high humidity conditions. After multiple soggy and slippery experiences, he saw an opportunity to create ultra-breathable performance hiking boots designed to perform in tropical conditions. It helps that he\u2019s also an MIT grad.",
      "Kapil was also motivated by a desire to highlight the passion for life and resilience that is often found amidst adversity in the poor parts of the world by promoting health and wellbeing in regions that are not always comfortable and hard to enjoy.",
      "Kapil searched the globe for the best designers and factories, then engineered a product to perform equally well across all wet climates. He knew that no corner could be cut, and every detail had to be perfect. The result is a footwear line Made in Europe from best materials designed to solve the simple problem of staying comfortable when the conditions are at their worst.",
      "We chose our name after a rare goat-antelope found in Eastern Himalayas at the junction of India, China, and Myanmar. Mishmi Takin lives far away from mankind on remote, forested slopes, and many of our original concepts were born in their hometown.",
      "Mishmi Takin inherently have the great traction needed to go up and down the steep slopes, as well as an oily coating on its fur to ward off the rain.",
      "We wanted to bring these little known champions into the spotlight, and also learn from their strengths as we designed our products. In total we have 12 different styles of boots and jackets, which you can view on our website ... WWW.MISHMITAKIN.COM.",
      "We are constantly dreaming about the range of products we would like to bring to you. We are already working on future purpose-built products to target other specific climates. Future shoes could include a \u201cdesert runner\u201d designed for speed on sandy surfaces.",
      "We will be posting the size chart for boots and apparel shortly. In case, there are issues with fit after delivery, we will exchange the products to get you the right fitting product.",
      "The products come with a 3 year warranty. If you are unsatisfied for any reason or there are any performance issues, we will do an exchange or refund as needed.",
      "We are raising funds to launch the production and distribution of our outdoor gear, so any donation you can make helps a lot! However, sharing our message online, and encouraging your friends & colleagues to view our products can also make a world of difference!",
      "Mishmi Takin is dedicated to making our world a better and healthier place. Mishmi Takin is more than just a brand. It is about finding passion for life in completely unexpected places.",

      "One solution is to get frequent checkups at the vet. But vet trips can cause lots of stress to you AND your pet.",
      "Vet trips are also quite expensive, and have only gotten more so in recent years.",
      "Why not check on your pet at home and save on those expensive vet visits? Introducing: Cym702 Pet!",
      "Cym702 Pet is a test kit that uses a machine learning algorithm to analyze your pet\u2019s urine in just 60 seconds, providing accurate numerical results on 10 test parameters for a rough overview of your pet's health.",

      "Before you start taking a sample, install the Cym702 Pet app.",
      "After your pet has done their business, acquire a sample with the test kit.",
      "From your smartphone, open the Cym702 Pet app, then take a photo of the test kit attached to the boat. After a short wait, you\u2019ll have your test results!",
      "Once you get your results, you'll receive a short summary of how your pet is doing. Each of the 10 substances measured in the urine test is given a numerical result that reflects your pet's current health status.",
      "For some metrics, a yellow, red or black indicator means that you should conduct another test the next day and take note of any abnormalities. If you continue to see the same results without improvement, that means it\u2019s time to schedule a vet appointment.",
      "Chronic Diseases Related to the 10 Parameters!",
      "It\u2019s important to note that Cym702 Pet is NOT a replacement for vet visits! But, if you want to see if anything is out of the ordinary, then a quick test will let you know if it\u2019s time to seek professional advice.",
      "Thanks to the power of machine learning algorithms, Cym702 Pet test results have over 98% accuracy, 100% precision, and 95% sensitivity.",
      "Our advanced algorithm allows you to receive results on 10 different categories in just 60 seconds. Cym702 Pet measures blood, pH, protein, glucose, ketone, bilirubin, urobilinogen, S.G, WBC, and nitrite in your pet\u2019s urine, then uses in-app graphs and icons so you can tell at a glance how your pet is doing.",
      "Each of the test results can be checked in detail on the results page. You can also save your results so you can understand your pet\u2019s health trends at a glance.",
      "You can save test results in the app for a quick and easy look at past results as a reference. If you\u2019re living with multiple pets, you can also make separate profiles for each pet.",

      "For sanitation purposes, an extension rod is included for free that you can attach to the holder.",
      "This method is quick and easy when you\u2019re going out for a walk.",

      "You can also repurpose the packaging as an instruction manual or pet pad holder, letting you save on potential paper waste.",

      "2) Once you\u2019ve finished entering your pet\u2019s information, press the TEST button at the bottom of the main menu.",
      "3) Before your pet does their business, choose a sampling method and collect a urine sample from your pet.",
      "4) Use the app to set a 60 second timer while you secure the boat onto the holder.",

      "How do \u00a1Yappah! Crisps compare taste-wise vs. other snacks?",
      "Taste comes first! That\u2019s why we sent our chef on a mission to use carefully selected forgotten ingredients & rescue them to create a completely new type of snack. The results: a delicious snack with all the flavor nuance of a meal.",
      "Are there similar products out there?",
      "Some snacks may include chicken, others may include rescued ingredients -- but no others include both.",
      "Where do you source your ingredients?",
      "\u00a1YAPPAH! Protein Crisps help fight food waste by using safe and delicious ingredients that for a variety of reasons are surplus to their original requirements and would have otherwise been left behind if not included in \u00a1Yappah! Crisps.",

      "These are high-quality ingredients from reputable suppliers such as Tyson Foods and Molson Coors.",
      "What is in the Protein Crisps?",
      "What are the Protein Crisp Flavors?",
      "What is your brand / company about?",
      "Up in the Andes, we were introduced to a tradition, on the verge of being forgotten, that made a big impact on us. It was the concept of \u201cyapa,\u201d and it refers to the little something extra a merchant gives to a valued customer, so that nothing gets wasted.",
      "This concept inspired us. Because \u201cLet\u2019s waste food,\u201d said no one. Ever. At Yappah Foods, we aim to Discover Beauty in the Forgotten\u2122. Fighting food waste is just the beginning.",
      "How does Tyson fit in?",

      "What is Upcycled Chicken?",
      "We use Tyson chicken breast tenders in \u00a1YAPPAH! Protein Crisps. At times, the cutting process for the chicken breast tenders leaves a trim. We upcycle this chicken tender trim into \u00a1YAPPAH! Protein Crisps to add value to an otherwise low-value trim. Once incorporated into the Protein Crisps, it adds flavor and protein.",
      "What are rescued veggie purees?",
      "Veggie purees are usually sold to make juice. The ones we are sourcing are close to their expiration date and would have been trashed if not given new life by being incorporated into \u00a1YAPPAH! Protein Crisps. They are perfectly good in terms of quality and provide great flavor.",
      "What is rescued spent grain?",
      "These spent grains (malted barley) are a byproduct of the beer brewing process. They would have been used for non-human consumption or trashed if not provided to us.",
      "Why package it in a can?",
      "Aluminum cans are fully recyclable. In this way the product helps fight food waste on the inside while the can fights packaging waste on the outside.",

      "Stop renting cloud storage, own your data and start earning rewards by sharing your unused storage",
      "Ready to take the internet back from Big Tech? Box by Functionland makes YOU the OWNER of your space in the cloud!",
      "Cloud computing has given us real-time collaboration, backup and sync, sharing, and access to our data from anywhere. It has become a pillar of our life online. But cloud providers don\u2019t run the cloud for free. They demand something in return. That\u2019s why they track our behavior online, sell our info to third parties, and change terms and conditions when it suits them. . . . Some even claim legal ownership of our data!",
      "Most of us find the advantages of cloud services worth the monthly subscription fees. Some of us are even willing to sacrifice privacy or spend time watching ads.",
      "What if there was a better way?",
      "Big Tech charges you to use its cloud hardware. You rent cloud services by paying with cash, personal data and privacy. Box is different. With Box, YOU are the owner. You can reclaim your privacy. Box is powered by our open-source, peer-to-peer protocols. These protocols form the Fula network: a secure, encrypted network that replaces big tech hardware with individual Box owners.",
      "You get photo storage, automatic backups, and other free-to-use services. Your data is always available, always secure.",
      "Box is built from the ground up. It was designed to put the power back into YOUR hands. There is no tracking and no ads. Your data is your property, and yours alone. Your photos, files, and data are fully encrypted. Nobody else has a key. Only you can access your data. Only you can share it.",
      "Box is stationary hardware that sits on your desk, syncs with your devices and provides all the advantages you\u2019ve come to expect from cloud services. Anything you choose to store, from cellphone photos to laptop files, are fully encrypted, synced and kept safe within your Box.",
      "Your Box connects with other Boxes to form the secure, people-owned Fula network. Box stores your encrypted data and also maintains backups on other Box devices connected to the Fula network. And it gives you seamless data access from anywhere. No matter what, your data is as safe and recoverable as it is in the cloud, only for free. Available on all your devices, accessible from anywhere.",
      "Cloud storage services typically offer either too little storage or way, way too much at far too high a cost. Box XL comes with 1 terabyte of storage. If you need more, you can expand your Box by plugging in an existing storage device you already own, purchasing a new storage tower, or adding a framework expansion card which will become available as add-on before shipment.",
      "Box\u2019s photo app, Fotos, will be ready to use at launch. Fotos is a polished, forever-free app that provides swift, seamless, easy access to and sharing of your photos from anywhere, across any device.",
      "With the average American household spending at least $243 per year (2021) on internet subscription services, an investment in Box pays for itself within the first twelve months of ownership. When you start using Box, you start saving as much as $24+ per month, and earning $FULA tokens too.",

      "We founded Functionland because we felt increasingly cheated by cloud providers. It felt bad enough that they track our behavior, claim ownership of our private data, and engage in other questionable business practices. For the people at Functionland, everything changed the day a well-known provider changed terms without notice. This provider had promised the world free-forever photo storage, then used people\u2019s personal photos to train its AI. Suddenly that was no longer enough. The provider decided to charge everyone a monthly fee.",
      "In response, we began developing Fotos\u2014a privacy-focused replacement for photo storage that anyone who has a personal server can run for free.",
      "Our Fotos application gained huge support and is currently ranked in the top 3% of GitHub projects worldwide.",
      "But we soon realized one app wasn\u2019t enough. Not everyone has the knowledge and time required to own and maintain a personal server. They are difficult to set up and hard to keep running. Even when they work, personal servers don\u2019t offer all the functionality you can get from the cloud.",
      "We realized that free open-source cloud service alternatives were being held back by the paying problem. As long as there are cloud hardware landlords, users and developers will be forced to pay rent. We can never be free.",
      "To solve this, we began creating an alternative platform, one that provides the same ease and broad potential people find in the cloud. Our solution is Box: a low-cost, plug-and-play hardware.",
      "As developers and open-source contributors, we also saw how funding issues limited the full potential of open source. We wanted to create a platform that enabled open-source contributors, who provide value to millions of people around the world, with a way to finally be compensated for their work.",
      "We have also onboarded some of the biggest names in Web3 as investors and/or partners in this journey, including Protocol Labs, Dfinity, Cudos, Filecoin, Techstars, DoraHacks, Crust Network, Outlier Ventures and Master Ventures. Many others \u2013 too many to name! \u2013 have provided funding and support for our project.",
      "In the past, there have been other attempts to create a people-powered alternative to cloud storage and services. But they were too restrictive. They were owned by centralized companies. They ran on closed-source hardware. And the technology was still immature, hindered by a lack of smart contracts necessary to enforce agreements in the absence of a central authority.",
      "We wanted to build an open platform that anyone could contribute to and help build. A platform where anyone could access the system using low-cost, energy-efficient hardware. That\u2019s why we created a built-in incentive layer.",
      "The Fula network\u2019s incentive layer turns the paying problem on its head. Open-source developers used to have to pay to host a free alternative to cloud services. With the Fula network, developers, UX designers, and content creators earn for building and creating on the platform. And users get those services for free.",
      "This is the future we are building. Fairer, functional, and free to evolve.",
      "We believe in the power of people, this is why we want to create the People-Owned Network: a network where every user is also an owner. We need your help to make this dream a reality! Please share the campaign with your friends, neighbors, family, and colleagues, so we can make Box the success we all believe in.",
      "Check out the videos on top of the page for more reviews.",
      "Regardless of your contribution and the perk you selected, you are eligible to get 100% refund up to 100 days after the end of the campaign. After this period there will be no refund, as the funds will be spent as part of the manufacturing process.",
      "Hardware:",
      "Our biggest hardware concern is driven by current global chip shortages. Delays are a risk for us, just as they are for other manufacturers. But we have been offsetting that risk by securing and setting aside the necessary hardware, and we have already stockpiled enough to guarantee we meet our launch target. Additionally, with any hardware there is always the risk of encountering bugs during final testing. If we find any issues, a modification or redesign could lead to delivery delays. (Prototyping the Box hub, for example, has a 10- to 14-day turnaround time.) To offset this, we\u2019re building on open-source hardware and with the support of globally-recognized product designers, significantly reducing the risk of hardware bugs.",
      "Software:",
      "We are currently building the protocols that will enable Box to form a decentralized cloud alternative. Two of the three major protocols are well underway, with delivery expected by Q2 2022. The two that are almost complete are sufficient to run the features we have outlined in this campaign. The third major protocol will enable new capabilities and will be announced after the campaign is complete, In order to minimize these risks, we have partnered with Protocol Labs, 4ire Labs and other prominent names in web3 technology.",
      "Funding:",
      "As with any new venture, financial stresses and challenges are always a risk. However, we are fully funded to support our crowdfunding campaign by 1.1M seed funding raised from reputable names in technology, such as Protocol Labs,  and we are not dependent on Box sales to reach our goals. We designed our crowdfunding campaign in order to share the results of our work with innovators and the community first.",
      "Despite potential challenges, we are on schedule to deliver our plug-and-play Boxes. Users will Fotos and our Files and Password Manager apps, with additional apps available in Q4 in order to coincide with the first Box shipments. Box\u2019s application stack will expand by onboarding developers into the ecosystem.\n\nPlease read the Q&A for Terms and Conditions before contributing. By contributing you accept the risks associated with the project as a high-rks project, and accept that the quality of deliverable might not be sufficient due to technical unknowns of any new project. Furthermore, the delivery of perks is to the best efforts and not guaranteed.",

      "1 minute foot care product made through patented glass-etching technology",
      "Your socks and shoes suffocate your feet for the whole day. If you don\u2019t take care of your feet even for a little bit, they often become dry, form dead skin cells, and can even smell.",
      "Many consumers gave us various answers to this question.",
      "In reality, foot care is cumbersome to do at home and was extremely difficult for people who are clumsy in using tools.",
      "The painful experiences of getting a cut on the skin by the sharp foot file or the inconveniences of having to take a foot bath to soak the dead cells in as well as unsatisfying results have led people to less prefer foot care.",
      "Consequently, we prepared \u2018TOOLA\u2019, a total foot care beauty item that can resolve all these problems at once. You can easily take care of your feet by immediately using it on your dry feet for just 1 minute a day.",
      "It\u2019s a product that will help you get rid of all your feet problems such as dryness, smell, fungal infection, etc.",
      "TOOLA is a home-use foot care file that is made of 100% glass.",
      "The embedded glass etching technique is used to protect the skin and effectively remove dry-skin. It is also hygienic and easy to wash.",
      "Caring for your feet can now be done easily at home. In only a minute, you can experience your own salon shop with your feet feeling fresh!",
      "TOOLA is a hypoallergenic foot exfoliator that has been made through the glass-etching patented technology. Thus, people with sensitive skin can also use TOOLA.",
      "TOOLA removes the dead skin cells without damaging your skin. The semiconductor technique has been integrated on glass to create nano patterns with tiny bumps on the contact surface. The \u2018irritation-free glass-etching patented technology\u2019 is TOOLA\u2019s exclusive technology that protects the skin while removing the dead skin cells.",
      "Wait a minute, Do you think TOOLA will be less effective because it is gentle and hypoallergenic?",
      "Well, that\u2019s simply not true.",
      "You don\u2019t necessarily have to apply pressure with a sharp surface to effectively remove the dead skin cells on your feet.",
      "Sharp foot files actually carve out the surface of your skin. This causes wounds on your skin that can develop into more severe disorders such as skin damage, tetanus, etc. Generally, these tools are sharp because they are made out of stainless steel. They are also extremely dangerous because they can make your skin bleed if used in a wrong way. Moreover, they even cause a reverse effect to make your skin layers even thicker than they were before exfoliating them.",
      "TOOLA is a foot file born from a new concept which eliminates all the disadvantages of existing ones.",
      "Unlike other foot files that use stainless steel, TOOLA uses the glass material made out of glass-etching technology, which effectively removes all the dead skin cells without irritating the skin.",
      "The glass-etching technology creates flat top surfaces on the tiny bumps that form the glass pattern, which reduces skin irritation. Also, the body parts of the bumps have been manufactured in the curvature form with an appropriate angle to effectively exfoliate the dead skin cells. These chemically processed glass bumps are effective because they can penetrate into the dead skin cells based on their angle.",
      "They are also in the cylindrical shape, which allows the dead skin cells to be cleansed away easily.",
      "We have carried out a test with kiwis, and the difference of the exfoliating effect between the standard foot file and the TOOLA glass was evident through the outcomes as shown below.",
      "Problems with standard foot file is that it damages unwanted skin layers, however, with the glass foot file, it only effectively and safely removes dry-skin and dead skin cells.",
      "Unlike the standard foot file that only has one type of function, TOOLA provides 2-in-1 foot care with two functions that you can use based on your feet condition.",
      "The STEP 1 surface of TOOLA removes the hard dead skin cells that are stuck in between your skin. The STEP 2 surface effectively exfoliates the soft dead skin cells that are spread all over the epidermis of your skin.",
      "The total care that TOOLA provides through two steps allows your feet to feel more revitalized. It not only delicately exfoliates the old dead skin cells that are stuck in between the skin of your soles, heels, and the sides of your feet, but also removes the dead skin cells that lie on the surface of your skin.",
      "As long as you dedicate yourself to using TOOLA consistently, you can always clean and rejuvenate your skin even if you have calluses and old dead skin cells that are tough to get rid of.",
      "You don\u2019t need to soak your feet wet to use TOOLA. Just use it for \u20181 minute\u2019.",
      "The existing standard foot files usually require you to soak your feet in the water first to gently and effectively remove the dead skin cells. However, you at least need to spend around 20-30 minutes for the process of turning on the tap water, soaking your feet, and waiting for the dead skin cells to soften. Then you also have to scrub your feet, which might take up a total of 1 hour for the entire process.",
      "But aren\u2019t you tired of always waiting for your feet skin to soften in water every time you have to exfoliate them?",
      "If so, TOOLA is the solution for you. We implemented all the necessary technology into TOOLA to allow you to gently and effectively exfoliate your feet in its dry state. You no longer have to waste your time soaking them in water.",
      "One of the most important characteristics of TOOLA is that it can be managed hygienically by rinsing it off with water.",
      "The existing standard foot files have drawbacks when it comes to managing them. They may cut your hands when you wash them and the remains of the dead skin cells stay on them even when you rinse them with water.",
      "Foot files that cannot be washed thoroughly are not only unhygienic, but also dangerous for your skin. The unsanitary environment makes it easier for bacteria to propagate, which increases your chance of developing bacterial skin infection.",
      "Therefore, we took a different approach. As you may already know, TOOLA is made out of 100% glass material, which allows all dead skin cells to rinse away with water.",
      "Moreover, TOOLA is different from cheap glass that breaks easily. It is a safe product that is made out of selected premium glass that has passed the test which detects 26 toxic substances and also completed the safety standard test.",
      "TOOLA is very light and compact. It is light enough to take it to your travel destinations and business trips. TOOLA boasts an elegant design as a transparent glass that is charming enough to display it as an interior product in the house.",
      "It is not only compact, but also has excellent grip. As it is a 115 x 45 rectangular glass, it has high quality grip and excellent portability that allow you to comfortably hold on to it while removing the dead skin cells.",
      "Scrub your dry sole with the STEP 1 surface. This step allows you to file the hardened dead skin cells stuck in between your skin. Exfoliate sufficiently until your sole becomes covered in white flakes of dead skin cells.",
      "Now, gently scrub your sole with the STEP 2 surface for 10~20 seconds. This step allows you to exfoliate the stratum corneum that is blocking the entire skin surface and also clear away the fine dead skin cells that have been raised on the surface. It lightens and smooths your skin.",
      "Keep your TOOLA GLASS clean by running some water over it for a few seconds. The dry the TOOLA GLASS after rinsing off the dead skin cells with the running water.",
      "It was essential for TOOLA to have a definite point of differentiation compared to other beauty products in the existing market as it presented \u2018innovative beauty\u2019 as its slogan.In the process of developing TOOLA, we decided to use 100% glass material and applied a different exfoliating method in contrast to other existing foot files. Producing TOOLA through the hypoallergenic glass-etching technology upgraded the product effectiveness and also eliminated any factors that cause skin irritation.",
      "\u2018TOOLA\u2019 is a safe, high performance, and elegantly designed product that fulfills consumers\u2019 needs and promotes innovative beauty.",
      "TOOLA is a body care brand striving for \u201cgreatness beyond goodness\u201d as well as \u201chealth and beauty\u201d. TOOLA\u2019s goal is to create beauty TOOLS of the finest quality through innovative ideas and design.

She was more than a life partner \u2014 she was my creative muse, my motivation, and the driving force behind my journey into jewelry design. Her courage, strength, and grace continue to inspire every piece I create.",
