      "Doctor-approved socks with Patented arch strengthening - Choose from 14 Styles - Dressy to Athletic!",
      "Created by a renowned podiatrist, ArchTek has launched a unisex dress sock that features a patented arch support system and uncompromising style. The sock\u2019s advanced materials, built-in insole, and trademarked energy return system brings comfort technology to the world of fashion footwear.",
      "We took the best sock out there and added our proprietary patented dynamic arch support for your foot, comfort, and everyday life and style.",
      "Patented five-layer dynamic arch support system that has been shown to support the arch without weakening it as most insoles do. The arch is held in a way that adds structure and support but also trains the brain and leg muscles to control the arch, reducing foot and leg fatigue.",
      "ArchTek\u00ae socks are fashionable and made of premium quality antibacterial materials to provide comfort and style, while also providing support and relief. ArchTek\u00ae socks come in 12 fashionable dress socks and 4 reinforced athletic socks.",
      "*Backers can pick their sock styles & size when claiming the perk.",
      "Our fashion dress socks come with built-in arch support and take the place of costly and ill-fitting insoles. Our patented dynamic arch support system stabilizes the foot without weakening the arch structures all without compromising your style.",
      "ArchTek athletic socks provide the same patented arch support as our fashion socks but with a more robust yarn weave. This allows better dynamic support of the arch and foot during heavier and more intense activity.",
      "Dr. Bob Baravarian is the inventor of ArchTek's patented arch support system and is a board-certified foot & ankle surgeon with more than 20 years\u2019 of patient care experience. After he experienced foot pain during his travels, Dr. Bob wondered if there was a better and more affordable solution than wearing special shoes or expensive custom insoles to prevent foot pain. He worked for more than 2 years to re-engineer every aspect of the classic sock to create a more modern sock that is better for the foot and leg. \u201cArchTek stands for innovation, and changing the status quo for affordable, every day, fashionable socks.\u201d",
      "Nearly 8 in 10 Americans have suffered from foot pain and are also likely to have pain in other parts of their body because of it, according to the American Podiatric Medical Association. However, many people don't realize a sock can do as much to support the foot as an insole or a shoe can.",
      "ArchTek\u00ae is more than just a sock. It is footwear featuring patented technology that is a complete overhaul of the traditional dress sock. The ArchTek\u00ae sock allows the wearer to wear their athletic or dress shoes of choice, without compromising style or support.",
      "True-Fit Sizing allows us to tailor our socks to fit everyone without compromise. This means there is no bunching up fabric in the toe area, and the heel will fit like a glove. Our socks come in the two most popular sizes, covering a range of almost 80% of adults.",
      "Check our FAQ's for more information on picking your size.",
      "We are honored to have your support, and we are thankful for your trust. We want to say thank you, and that we appreciate the faith you have in our brand to back our product.",
      "Your feedback, good or bad, makes us a better brand and lets us serve you better, so please don\u2019t keep quiet and message us directly.",
      "Risks and challenges",
      "At ArchTek, we understand the importance of brand reputation, especially for new brands. We have spent over 2 years in preparation for this launch, which consists of design, product development, establishing logistics and shipping channels and executing pre-production runs to ensure a seamless and enjoyable experience to our backers. We will be working with trusted manufacturers, who supply many global brands. They work with some of the world\u2019s biggest brands and have the capability, scale and expertise to meet any demand. We have the utmost confidence in their ability to deliver. We also planned for production risks by producing approximately 1200 of each SKU, and could quickly manufacture more as needed. Regardless, there could be production delays as with any manufacturing. We will perform thorough checks of the finished pieces using industrial QC standards. With any high volume production run, the biggest inherent risk is timing. We\u2019ve consulted with numerous logistics experts and sample tested our manufacturer to ensure we can deliver an amazing product on time. We will be extremely transparent and open with regards to updates on the status of production and shipment. We will be working with a local fulfillment center in the US, hence custom charges may apply depending on where you're ordering from. Each parcel will have a tracking number so it can be tracked. Unfortunate events can sometimes happen, so in the event a parcel is lost during its delivery we will do everything we can to help track it down and if the error is with our team we will send you a new one. However, we are not responsible for packages delivered outside the expected time frame. We will be posting regular updates here.",

    "company_name": "Sparkle Team",
    "allParagraphs": [
      "All Around Cooling | Gentle Air Volume | Skin-friendly| Adjustable Buckle| Ultra-Quiet | Lightweight",
      "You might have tried different ways to deal with the summer heat, by using handheld fans, neck coolers or even wear some heavy cooling vests. These devices either occupy your hands, or are ineffective, which isn\u2019t cool at all (pun intended), and only makes summer a bummer!",
      "However, there\u2019s good news. We are excited to introduce you SPARKLE TORNADO, a powerful wearable waist fan that frees up your hands and gives you an all around cooling experience with five lightweight fans built-in.",
      "Quick Facts About Sparkle Tornado",
      "1. All Around Cooling",
      "The traditional waist fan is indeed a waste of a fan. With only one air outlet and air blowing in one direction.",
      "However, Tornado intelligently solves this problem by using five fans that are powered by strong wind turbine technology, which uniformly blow 585 L/Min of air volume in all directions, ensuring you enjoy all around cooling.",
      "2. A Soft Breeze That Will Put You At Ease",
      "Traditional fans blow direct wind which can be painfully uncomfortable after an extended period of use. Sparkle Tornado however runs on a 48-tooth gear, which causes it to release a mellow but effective breeze, which feels almost like a natural Greek islands kind of breeze.",
      "3. The Design Is Light and Just Right",
      "With each fan weighing no more than 100 g, wearing this fan will feel quite light, and the fit will be just right. Different from the 1 kg heavy, poor performing, and ordinary waist fans, Sparkle Tornado evenly distributes weight around the belt, for maximum comfort. It is ergonomically designed to be comfortable for the hip bone. Even when worn for long periods, your waist will not be worn out.",
      "Silicone belt + four fans = 628 g.",

      "The belt is made of skin-friendly, temperature, UV, and radiation-resistant silicone which is flexible and provides ultra comfort. The belt also \"breathes\", thereby quickly absorbing and dispersing sweat as it comes into contact with the skin. Unlike other belts that cannot absorb sweat, your belt will not develop a stinky odor.",
      "The silica gel inside hides and protects the circuits, and cools the body without leaving a nasty sweaty ring on the waist\u2019s skin.",
      "5. Ultra Quiet Operation",
      "According to appliance analysts, the most quiet fans are rated at 55 dB, therefore making Sparkle Tornado a perfect pick, as it is rated at 45 dB which is virtually noiseless. Also being at waist-length, you hear the fan even much less, and your hearing nerve can be protected; which 85 dB loud neck fans fail to do.",
      "6. A Long Battery Life That Will Wow You",
      "Sparkle Tornado\u2019s premium quality battery:",
      "7. Safe Design That Won\u2019t Catch, Twist & Tangle Objects",

      "With 40cm Z-axis, 4K 13.3\u201d LCD Screen, PrintHero is an industrial SLA 3D Printer for large projects.",
      "Getting creative with 3D printers is amazing but it's not easy to print large, complex 3D models with typical 3D printers. Many of them cannot support the demands of high quality, large scale prints.  Prints such as these require special printers that are expensive, fragile and not easy to operate and maintain.",
      "So we created PrintHero, an industrial level 4K SLA 3D Printer for large-scale Prints. It includes special features such as extra-large print volume, 4K high resolution, and premium build quality that makes 3D printing efficient and easy for anyone!",
      "PrintHero was designed to print extra-large projects that fit the size of big dreams. Supporting build volumes of up to 293*165*400mm, users can print whatever they desire in a groundbreaking large scale.",
      "Thanks to extra-large build volume, PrintHero is able to complete 34 pieces of standard dental model within 2hours at one-time, drastically boosting the printing efficiency.",
      "The printing speed of PrintHero is up to 30mm/h. It enables handling of high-volume print jobs faster, drastically reducing necessary work hours.",
      "Packed with a 3kg resin volume, PrintHero can be printed continually, bring out the maximum of the creativity without adding resins many times.",
      "PrintHero is equipped with a 13.3\u201d Industrial LCD Screen with 3840*2160 ultra-high resolution. Its 76\u03bcm XY and 10\u03bcm Z resolution lets you obtain ultra-fine print quality with more detail and dimensional accuracy.",
      "PrintHero delivers a uniform exposure for 98% of the surface area. With it, 3D models can be printed accurately within the whole printing area, which delivers a coincident precision to every dimension of 3D models.",
      "We used an all-metal design for PrintHero`s body not only to make it durable and stable during printing but also to make it a piece of art that will complement your workspace.",
      "The hydraulic rod flip cover design allows you to operate it with one hand, saving time and effort.",
      "The unique dual-liner slides are designed to ensure the smooth and high-precision movement of the 3D printer.  It can avoid print misalignment and provides a lifting force of up to 100kg for easy printing and demolding.",
      "The standard LCD screen can withstand a working temperature of 60 Celsius degrees. For the SLA 3D printer, it is designed with LCD-SLA principle and needs to place the LCD screen above the ultraviolet lamp. So if the temperature is too high, the LCD screen will be damaged and the printer will not work properly.",
      "PrintHero is designed with a super heat dissipation system and unique photothermal separation technology, which can keep the temperature of the LCD screen below 50 Celsius degrees even for a long time working, greatly extending the working life of the LCD screen.",
      "PrintHero comes with high quality liquid resins that are very affordable. We created 3 types of high-precision resins that satisfy the needs of any type of print project.",
      "PrintHero is also compatible with most available third party resins and you can use additional paints to achieve any color match you want.",
      "With the deluxe 5'' touchscreen monitor on the body, users can change print settings & track printing status anytime with simple touch controls.",
      "Other 3D printing systems are complicated and time-consuming. PrintHero is easy to use and you can get started printing in seconds with one-button prints and file transfer using LAN, USB drive or Wi-Fi connection.",
      "Thanks our backers Roi and Douglas for providing us these prototypes, and we\u2019ve printed.  link: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:533652; https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2810666;",
      "https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4543820.",
      "If you have some prototypes to print, welcome to share them in the comments and we\u2019ll print for you.",
      "PrintHero has been producing high-quality 3D printers for years. Now we enter the second stage of our brand development, marked by this SLA 3D printer. We still adhere to the original intention of making good products, and constantly bring good products to this world we love.",

      "A project that brings futuristic prototypes and an operating system with a high degree of reality.",
      "This project is exclusively dedicated to the creation of prototypes and may be commercialized in the near future.",
      "With this in mind, the devices in this project were designed to be timeless, as the exercise of this principle will bring benefits in several aspects, such as the attribute of modularity, where all internal components could be easily replaced by the users themselves, the reduction of compulsive purchases to obtain the latest model of a device, even if this did not bring real benefits, and lastly, the maturity of the applications that would be running on a mature, long-lasting platform with scalable resources.",
      "The two devices presented in this project will feature elliptical screens and a futuristic design, as well as a highly competitive operating system that, in addition to being ultra-realistic, will also pay its users based on their content.",
      "The funding obtained from this project will be used to build prototypes of the devices that will simulate Paradise OS. To do this, we will have a team of 7 people, who will be based in my city, Vit\u00f3ria da Conquista, Bahia, Brazil, where we will work for 1 year until the prototypes are ready.",
      "After this stage, the devices will be presented at technology events around the world in search of an investor who will enable the start of large-scale production and, once manufactured, they will be distributed in the retail market in the United States and, later, throughout the world.",
      "I believe that current technology has been stagnant for at least 10 years, as there is nothing truly new in current devices. I do not mean to say that what we have does not meet existing needs, but there is a very promising universe beyond the horizon that is not being explored, both in terms of design and systems. When a disruptive proposal is presented to the world, a sudden rise will be inevitable, as the general public will quickly realize the benefits and will hardly return to the evolutionary crumbs of current devices.",
      "Considering the current hardware market, there are significant barriers to repair and replacement of components, especially when it comes to portable devices, where virtually all components are soldered to the motherboard, which in many cases, a single defective component results in the complete replacement of the motherboard, inducing the user to pay a much higher amount than the defective component, or even forcing him to buy a new device.",
      "Paradise OS will be simulated in prototypes that will have similar characteristics to those that will be presented on the day of its launch.",
      "Immersion | Create a virtual business and showcase your products and services to the world in an ultra-realistic and natural environment, take advantage of 3D avenues to visit favorite stores, participate in real-time events, meet friends or study in libraries.",
      "Monetization | Developers will have their revenues based on the time their applications are used, so they will have the equivalent of each user\u2019s usage compared to the other applications that the user uses. Users will be monetized for the content they create, from a relevant comment to a URL of their personal website, everything will be subject to monetization.",
      "Freedom | An operating system with unlimited genuine content and no ads, from an e-book to professional software, everything will be available for $9.90/month.",
      "No Ads | Applications may be developed in native language or web applications, as long as they meet monetization requirements, such as complete removal of ads and tracking tags to keep users free from banners, pop-ups and cookie messages.",

      "New Writing Experience/Stylish premium writing instrument.Equipped with pen clip and window breaker",
      "I've been thinking, what should I say when we launch the new project? \"Hello backers, we are the Comandi team\"? Or \"Nice to meet you guys, this is our new project\"? .....",
      "No, none of that! When the project is going to launch, the first thing I want to say is: thank you, backers! Without the millions of backers around the world, there wouldn't be a chance for us to write these words here and launch the project! So, all of our backers are our lucky stars! And we are looking forward to bringing a lucky experience for every backer with our new project!",
      "Next, Let me introduce our new project to you \u2014Titanium 2-in-1 bolt pen. Maybe you will wonder what\u2019s special about a pen. Now, let\u2019s take a look at this pen.",
      "As you can see, it looks very stylish and technological, and the entire body of the pen glows with the unique metallic luster of titanium alloy. Whether you are a businessman or an outdoor enthusiast, its high-class, cool temperament will surely be a perfect match for your status!",
      "In terms of practicality, it combines the functions of writing and window breaker, a smooth writing experience, and an escape tool in times of emergency, which can meet the needs of your daily life and work in many aspects!",
      "More importantly, it is made of Gr5 titanium material, no matter how long it is used, it will not be bad, nor rust deformation, it can be said that such a bolt pen can replace your usual hundreds of pens!",
      "As a bolt pen, writing is the most basic function, we have equipped this bolt pen with a special refill (German brand - Schneider G2), which has very good writing smoothness and is very easy to buy in daily shops, you can change the refill to different colors to meet the rich writing needs.",
      "Twist the bolt device of the pen body to the bottom slot, then you will write smoothly,  when you're done using it, you can twist the bolt mechanism to the center to retract the nib and lock the mechanism in place.",
      "When you need to replace the refill, twist the lower part of the pen body to remove the replacement refill smoothly.",
      "The top of the pen body, takes the tungsten steel design of the window breaker, to protect you in critical moments, it can break the car glass, or other windows, in time to escape all the dangers, to protect the safety of life. In addition, after working at night, if we meet some dangerous people or when the other side makes some dangerous moves, we can also use this tungsten steel head to protect ourselves and allow ourselves to escape.",
      "Twist the bolt mechanism of the pen body to the top slot to activate the window breaker function, and when you are done using it, twist the bolt mechanism to the center to retract the window breaker and lock the device. Window Breaker is also very smooth and won't hurt your fingers. You don't have to worry about safety issues.",
      "The whole pen body is designed with different shapes of grooves, which can play a good anti-slip role, even if your palm has water or sweat, it will not affect you to hold the pen body tightly. And this design can make your grip more comfortable, there is a wonderful feeling of massaging the finger joints, although this is a little exaggerated, but the fact can really feel, haha.",
      "The E-bolt action mechanism on the body of the pen has three twist directions corresponding to three slots. The top slot enables the window breaker, the middle slot corresponds to a locking device, and the bottom slot enables the writing function. When we designed the slots, we took into account the strength of the connection between the spring and the bolt, thus ensuring that the bolt is very silky smooth.",
      "The pen is designed with a pen clip, so after using this bolt pen, you can always clip it to your pocket, book, backpack, etc. The elasticity of the pen clip has also been adjusted several times to ensure that it can easily hold things as well as not fall off.",
      "Next to the bolt action mechanism, we have added a Tritium Slot for the luminous vials. The luminous vials not only give the appearance a more technological look, but it is also very convenient for you to find this pen in the dark.",
      "We offer luminous vials as an additional option. Luminous vials make light by absorbing light. They can be charged under a bright light source and will glow in the dark for some time. This option is generally less expensive than tritium tubes and may be suitable for those who do not need constant glow or are looking for a cost-effective option. However, the brightness and duration of light depend on the amount and intensity of light absorbed.",
      "sturdy and durable\uff1a Titanium's corrosion resistance and high hardness make this bolt pen not only resistant to all common erosion factors, but It can also ensure that the pen will not easily break under any circumstances, even if it is accidentally dropped on the road and run over by a car, it will not break.",
      "Even though it is made of metal, the weight of the whole pen is only 24g, and the design of the overall weight follows the principle of \"light on the top and heavy on the bottom\", which ensures that you can get a good sense of balance when writing, and your hand won't get tired.",
      "The whole bolt pen is very small, only 5.24IN/133mm in length, and the diameter of the pen body is 0.34IN/9.8mm, which fully meets the needs of daily carrying with the design of the pen holder. Whether it's writing at your desk, signing meeting minutes, or marking outdoors, it's easy to put in your pocket and always at your service.",
      "While you're racking your brain and thinking about your work, the bolt action mechanism of the pen can be a little fidget toy, Get inspired during the up-and-down twist to make work more enjoyable! Or you can turn the pen and let the pen body arc beautifully over your knuckles, and even if it accidentally flies out you won't know to worry about breaking it!",
      "So far, I believe you must have a very detailed understanding of this pen. So next, I want to tell you why we designed such a pen.",
      "As a professional company that has been plowing into the EDC field for many years, we have an excellent team of designers, a well-equipped manufacturing plant, and a very insightful operation team, and we have also successfully launched several outdoor EDC tool projects on Kickstarter, each successful delivery is not only a surprise to all the backers, but also a great affirmation of our company.",
      "So, we are committed to the EDC field, adhere to the original intention, the pursuit of innovation, and expect to give more backers around the world to create more outstanding and innovative EDC tools, so that every backer can feel our heart and professionalism.",
      "Before launching this bolt pen, we did a lot of market research work, and also carefully studied every titanium pen project published on Kickstarter, in-depth understanding of each backer's experience.",
      "Every project was wonderful! but there is always a design need to improve in one way or another. For example: the pen body is too thick and bulky, the pen body is not added to the anti-slip design, resulting in an uncomfortable grip, the bolt device is not stable enough, and so on. Inspired by this, we decided to design a titanium pen that was superior in every way to our innovative spirit.",
      "After months of communication with members of the company's design team, during which we overturned several sketches, we finally designed such a stylish and practical titanium bolt pen with a very comfortable experience. When we gave the design drawings to our factory's CNC Engineer, they also showed us real samples very efficiently. Finally, the gun bolt pen shown to you on the page is simple and atmospheric in design, more practical in function, and the CNC processing technology makes this gun bolt pen more exquisite!",
      "The whole casing of the bolt pen takes CNC machining, this process can ensure that every part of the bolt pen is very delicate, no matter whether it is the groove of the pen body or the streamlined feeling of the whole pen body, it gives people a very comfortable experience in visually and tactilely.",
      "We are excited to offer free worldwide shipping to all our backers. With this perk, you can have your Bolt-action Pen delivered to your doorstep without any extra charges. We aim to provide a seamless and hassle-free experience, allowing you to fully enjoy your Bolt-action Pen without incurring additional costs.",
      "Thanks so much for taking the time to learn about our project. Your support is essential for this project. We will do our best to produce a perfect product.",

From Canada\u2019s boreal forests to the tropics of Sumatra, we want to make an impact and rebuild degraded ecosystems on every corner of the earth. Forests don\u2019t just pull CO2 from the atmosphere. They provide homes and food for millions of species, from insects to elephants, they bring more rainfall and capture the rain, cooling the air and stabilizing the climate. They are the livelihoods and source of income for all the communities living off the forests.",

      "Inclusivity: We want everyone to have a way of personally contributing to a large-scale environmental solution through an organization they can trust.",
      "Quality: We work closely with botanists and forestry experts, and use multispectral mapping UAV technology to select ideal planting sites and provide valuable follow up data on ecosystem health.",
      "Cooperation: We are committed to partnering with local groups, agencies, scientists, and individuals of all types to share knowledge and resources for best reforestation solutions.",
      "FAQ:",
      "How do guarantee your trees will grow?",
      "Before we plant our pods, we pre-germinate the seeds inside using our own \u201csecret sauce\u201d. This ensures that the seeds have already sprouted before they\u2019re even in the ground and that they have a strong rooting system when they grow. Not only that, but after we plant them we follow up with our spraying drone to remove competition and provide nitrogen and other nutrients for the best chance of success. We continuously monitor our seedlings with the mapping drone to make sure they\u2019re healthy.",
      "How do you plant the trees?",
      "We plant our seed pods, using a heavy-lift drone that\u2019s been customized with a pneumatic firing device to insert the pods into the soil at the appropriate depth.",
      "Tree planting companies use seedlings. Why would they use seed pods instead of seedlings if it takes longer to grow?",
      "Planting pods has several advantages over seedlings.",
      "1) Drones allow us to plant pods 10X faster per drone than seedlings can be planted.",
      "2) Our seed pods contain 3 pre-germinated tree seeds, mycorrhiza, nutrients and other supportive species for the area.",
      "3) Pods are much less energy/ water intensive to produce and have a lower environmental impact.",
      "4) Pods can be created in mass within a month, whereas seedlings take 1 to 2 years of intensive care in a nursery before they can be planted. This allows us to plant rapidly and at 20% the cost of a seedling.",
      "Are you qualified?",
      "Yes. Three of our core members have backgrounds in science and engineering. Additionally, we\u2019re working closely with scientists with PhD's in botany, seed genetics, and forestry specialists on every job. We are fully certified and licensed for UAV operation in Canada.",
      "What tree species do you plant?",
      "This year we planted eight deciduous and coniferous species local to Southern Ontario. We can easily fill our pods with seeds of virtually any tree species (except for acorns and a few of the larger exceptions). If interested, we can also plant any flora that\u2019s appropriate for an ecosystem in it\u2019s successional period.",
      "In your video you talk about planting for full eco-system recovery, how are you doing this?",
      "We know that planting a single tree species will not restore an ecosystem to its natural state nor will it guarantee a healthy forest. That\u2019s why we develop pods that capture the relevant tree seeds, mycorrhiza, nutrients, and soil properties for the target area. Seeds from local sources are usually the best adapted to the target ecosystem but even that isn\u2019t always the case. Climate change has rapidly changed ecosystems and sometimes seeds from lower latitudes are actually more likely to survive in warming climates. We are building a team of experts in restoration ecology to ensure that science underpins all of our efforts and captures nature\u2019s nuances.",
      "Do you work with companies that are interested in planting only one or two types of trees?",
      "While our focus is on full-eco system recovery, we can work with others, including oil and timber companies, who prioritize a select few tree species. However, we will always push to ensure our seedlings have the best chance of success and will disclose what the ecosystem's needs are to ensure this.",
      "Where do you operate?",
      "So far we\u2019ve planted in southern Ontario. However, we are in talks for potential work in Alberta and Brazil (Atlantic Forest). Our sights are set internationally and we are actively working to scale this globally.",
      "Risks and challenges",
      "Reforestation is an extremely nuanced field and in order for us to bring this technology across international borders we need funding..and we need it quick. We have an immediate need to purchase equipment that will allow us to produce millions of seed pods. Additionally, we require access to the best experts available in botany, ecology, seed genetics, engineering and automation. We have overcome every challenge we have faced up until this stage and we know what is needed next. By sponsoring our company, you help us take our technology to the Pacific Forests of Canada, the Amazon Rainforests of Brazil and, ultimately, the globe.",

      "As your body naturally moves while you sleep, Aquarest changes shape along with the arch of the cervical spine. The water pressure improves blood flow throughout the body, massages your cervical spine, and helps to correct your alignment.",
      "How can you sleep without putting a burden on your spine?  Aquarest's water base has made it possible for you to sleep without adding pressure to the weak area of your cervical vertebrae. When you fall asleep, place your upper thoracic vertebrae (thoracic vertebrae 1 and 2 are marked as green below) on the pillow to protect your cervical spine from tensions. This is the C-TH support structure.",

      "Maybe you sleep like a log, barely stirring at all. Maybe you move every few hours, hugging your pillow one minute, resting your feet on it the next. Great news. Aquarest has designed two sizes that work for all kinds of sleepers. And unlike a cat, Aquarest won\u2019t get angry when you kick the blankets off.",

      "We often underestimate the environmental impact of small daily gestures.\nBut food residues left in containers \u2014 such as sauces, creams, cosmetics or detergents \u2014 generate millions of tons of useless waste every year. An American startup, LiquidGlide, has dedicated itself to this problem (03/24/25, 3:35 PM A startup to get mayonnaise out of the tube - Rai News https://www.rainews.it/archivio-rainews/articol...\nbrevetta-rivestimento-scivoloso-per-contenitori) which has however provided a CHEMICAL solution to the problem, the slippery coating studied even though it is of food origin, has NOT been well accepted by the companies involved, at least in the food sector. According to an estimate reported by the startup LiquidGlide, every year millions of tons of food residues from unemptied bottles end up in waste or in waterways up to the Oceans which together with the tons of PLASTIC, are bringing the ecosystems contained in them to their knees. In my small way I care a lot about this problem which for me is NOT a fad, I am a boomer and I have been recycling for 30 years now, and people tell me she looked like I was a bit crazy, I closed the bags with wet, paper, plastic written on them, inside me, a bit like Cassandra, I assumed at the time, that unfortunately we would get to this point sooner or later, since then I have adopted all the necessary precautions to reduce my impact on the planet, and then I am a mother, a housewife who faces like all of you small and large problems such as practical ones (and I add ECONOMIC), which seem silly but which often take away our good mood, patience and time, you see a container that forces us to do sometimes tiring maneuvers, like the one illustrated in the presentation video, made by our beloved Physics Professor and which gives the idea very well (https://youtube.com/shorts/G8mM4_iCrXc?si=xt2dg...), Now, imagine a container for mayonnaise, ketchup or other sauces that does not waste even a drop.\nA reusable, smart bottle with an adjustable internal plunger that pushes the product upwards without the need for bottom hits or cuts to the packaging.\nThis project was born from a concrete need: to use all the product, reduce waste, simplify life in the kitchen and make a concrete contribution to safeguarding the planet. A container that basically allows you this:\n\"You use all the product down to the last drop\"\n\"Economic savings over time\"\n\"Eco-friendly and reusable materials\"\n\"You can refill it with eco-refills\"\nIf you also think it's a good idea, I ask you to help me make it, I have filed the patent, in fact my 'product' is listed with the wording \"Product covered by utility model application no. 202025000001938 filed with UIBM (Italy). All rights reserved.\"\nbut to make it happen you need money that I don't have, I'm a housewife from SOUTHERN ITALY, with all the problems related to work (which I DON'T have and we know housewives in our country are NOT exactly a 'protected species')\nCampaign objective\nRaise funds to:\nMake the industrial mold.\nStart the production of the first pilot batch.\nThe project is in its infancy and the objective of the Indiegogo campaign is to finance the prototype, not to mass produce at least for now, with the desire to seek out interested companies, like all inventors\nYour support is precious because it can transform an idea into reality.\nTHANKS to those who will do it\nInvia commenti\nRiquadri laterali\nCronologia\nSalvate",

    "company_name": "I'M NOT A BARISTA",
    "allParagraphs": [
      "Grind, sift, customize, and update your coffee experience with dual-burr manual grinder MOMENTEM",
      "MOMENTEM\u2122 was designed for baristas and home brewers who are looking for something more in their coffee experience. The result? An exquisite cup of coffee with the benefits of two-step grinding \u2013 without the hassle \u2013 and an expanded flavor profile that will change the way you brew forever.",
      "This isn't just another fancy hand grinder with sharp burrs and a sleek body. MOMENTEM\u2122 is a call-to-action for the manual grinding industry to realize the potential of coffee engineering innovation. We can achieve so much more than modest improvements in burr technology and share these incredible innovations with coffee lovers everywhere.",
      "With MOMENTEM, I'M NOT A BARISTA is giving a big push to propel the hand grinding industry forward, and to take bigger steps in overhauling the ergonomics of manual grinding for everyone. After the overwhelming success of our previous crowdfunding campaign to launch the Brewing Guide, we're excited to work with the coffee community again to develop something truly inspiring and enjoyable.",
      "Professional baristas and coffee champions like Japanese champion Miki Suzuki have been experimenting with two-step grinding (regrinding) for years and achieved great results in the final cup quality, but the amount of effort it took made the technique unattractive for everyday brewing. MOMENTEM's double-burr set system, crafted with titanium-coated stainless steel, clears away the hurdles for two-step grinding.",
      "Burr Set #1: Grinds Coarse",
      "The first conical burr serves as the pre-breaker \u2013 the first step of MOMENTEM's two-step grinding system \u2013 breaking down the coffee beans into coarse grounds with more surface area. You can control the grind size settings of this burr with the 60-step outer adjustment ring. This will give you the ability to change the grind size from 600\u03bc up to 3000\u03bc.",
      "Burr Set #2: Grinds Fine",
      "The second conical burr receives the coarse grounds at a slower and more even feeding rate in order to minimize resistance, allowing the coffee particles to travel through the burrs more quickly. Its outer adjustment ring can turn a total of 4 revolutions, with each one comprising 100 clicks that individually change the distance between the burr by 0.015mm.",
      "In addition to featuring two burr sets, both of MOMENTEM's burr designs were customized to further optimize multi-step grinding mechanics. Standard conical burrs are cone-shaped for a reason \u2013 they mimic multi-step grinding on a small scale, allowing beans to break down gradually as they travel down the burr's length.",
      "Since MOMENTEM's first burr does that better, we took a risk and loped off the top half of the conical burr in the second set to 1) increase grinding capacity, 2) minimize coffee retention, and 3) decrease the total weight. We also increased the circumference of the 2nd conical burr to 36mm, making it 10-20% larger than the average conical burr in the market. Every edge is polished and set at an angle, for the smoothest grinding experience possible.",
      "Less heat is generated as compared to single-burr grinders, and coffee particles slowly feed into the second burr, corresponding to the theory of regrinding coffee. MOMENTEM also delivers a relatively narrow Particle Size Distribution (PSD) thanks to its dual-burr set. Where traditional single-burr grinders often produce chunky coffee grounds, MOMENTEM\u2019s two burrs effectively distribute stand-alone particles, ensuring high grind performance and delivering to you that satisfying fluffy heap of coffee grounds.",
      "Two-step grinding minimizes clogging and generates smaller PSD values, which translates to more consistency and an enhanced flavor profile.",
      "The dual-burr system is more complicated than a regular single-burr grinder, which means logically it will be more complicated to clean two burr sets. To solve this issue, our designers put together an easy assembly system that enables users to remove the second burr set with one single pull.",
      "This simple design requires high precision manufacturing. We make sure all surfaces, both inside and outside the 2nd burr set, are well-polished. The hexagonal design ensures that the burr set won't move during intensive grinding. At the same time, we use a non-threaded solution, the quick release ball lock pin system, to lock the burr set tightly inside the grinder.",
      "To minimize retention, we purposefully omitted straight angles in exchange for smooth surfaces and corners to prevent fine particles from getting caught within the internal structure.",
      "MOMENTEM\u2122 is versatile. Make full use of the two-step adjustment system to build unique brewing recipes for any brewing method, including Espresso, Turkish/Ibrik, Moka pot, Aeropress, Pour over, Chemex, Cold brew, and more. With the numerical adjustment dials, it\u2019s easy to remember previous settings, keeping your brews consistent and your experiments traceable.",
      "Between over- and under-extraction, which is scarier? We believe both are equally frightful when you do not have control over the mechanics. That is why MOMENTEM\u2019s catch cup includes a built-in sifter where you can switch out different sieve sizes to get the perfect grind distribution every time. If you want to experiment with staccato espresso shots, this catch cup will be your best friend. Be the master of your own brews and take control over the results of daily grinding to get that perfect cup of coffee.",
      "The catch cup comes with a lid to cover the jar when you sift the coffee. The magnetic catch makes it safe and easy to use.",
      "We have only come this far because of the amazing support we\u2019ve received from this community! Click below on your favorite social platform to share MOMENTEM.",
      "Over the last few years, the market has witnessed only slight variations of the same shape, mechanics, and components in manual coffee grinder designs. Even though there is a genuine attempt at improvement, creativity has come to a standstill while the basic principles of ergonomic design have been glossed over. This results in muscle aches from daily grinding with a chassis that is simply too wide for our hands.",
      "MOMENTEM is here to change that. We were inspired by the beauty of various wine bottles, and after months of research, we\u2019ve crafted a sleek silhouette that stands out on your counter. The arduous process of manual grinding to make your daily cup of joe is a thing of the past. MOMENTEM promises a pleasant grinding experience as beautiful, and as awesome, as the coffee you brew.",
      "Because design matters, we only aim for perfection, which is why we decided to stick with a unibody design style. MOMENTEM's main body is carefully CNC-ed from one solid piece of aluminum metal.",
      "With a coffee capacity of around 25 grams (depending on the size and density of your coffee beans), MOMENTEM's sleek unibody is perfect for every single-dose brewing recipe and then some. The comfortable grip and quick grinding time will also make grinding for multiple cups a breeze. There's enough coffee for everyone.",
      "MOMENTEM is not only designed for different brewing methods, but also for different people. We are all coffee lovers, but we are also built differently in terms of arm length and hand sizes. That's why the crank arm is adjustable to fit your body. You can simply adjust the crank arm from 14cm to 16cm. A small change can make a big impact.",
      "The longer your crank is, the more momentum you can bring to your grinding. If you are an espresso lover, you'll know what we\u2019re talking about. It\u2019s challenging to grind espresso with a hand grinder with a short crank, but with an extended crank and two-step grinding, you\u2019ll find yourself looking forward to manually brewing your morning shot again in no time.",
      "We are passionate about infusing more natural elements into the design of MOMENTEM, even while recognizing that its primary construction is metal-based. The knob, specifically, is designed to not only complement the overall aesthetic of MOMENTEM seamlessly, but also to establish a touch of nature.",
      "The knob is meticulously crafted from ebony, one of the hardest and darkest woods native to Africa. Each piece of this unique wood is carefully handpicked and polished to perfection. The naturally occurring black hue and complex patterns of the wood render each knob truly one-of-a-kind and visually captivating. To provide a distinctive tactile experience, we have intentionally designed the top edges of the knob to be sharp, allowing for easy differentiation between the two knobs.",
      "*Updated on Sep 18, 2023\nWe have made an upgrade in our choice of material. Transitioning from coffee tree wood, we've now embraced the more luxurious and premium ebody wood for an enhanced aesthetic appeal.",
      "The grinder and case were designed in such a way that you may disassemble your MOMENTEM and safely store its various components away.",
      "Made with premium genuine leather, the case is artisanally handcrafted. Its materials and minimal aesthetic \u2013 combining beauty, simplicity, and functionality \u2013 draw inspiration from minimalist design, complementing the precise and manufactured nature of MOMENTEM.",
      "Your grinder case from now on is not just a toolbox. This stylish case allows you to safely organize, carry, and protect your new coffee gear. The result is a longer product lifetime for the grinder, which means that you can make the most of MOMENTEM\u2019s two-step grinding to brew your perfect cup of coffee. AND you can travel with it in style.",
      "We started the Coffee Wristbands Charity Program, a fundraising program, with the aim of bringing the coffee community together and contributing back financially. Wristbands designed by coffee-loving designers are being worn around the world to signal our solidarity with the coffee community.",
      "All profits from our Coffee Wristbands fundraiser are used to help coffee people in need and we hope to reach out to as many people as possible and make a positive impact on the community that we love and that we are a part of. Till now, our partners and us have donated more than $6900 USD.",
      "Add Coffee Wristbands to your pledge and join our clan of passionate, dedicated, and cheerful coffee-loving humans.",
      "Be the first to change your brewing game with MOMENTEM. We can't wait to build a close-knit community of grinding geeks as we explore the potential of MOMENTEM's dual burrs together.",
      "With immense pride and a sigh of relief, we are thrilled to announce that as of this September, we've transitioned into the mass production phase. As each component takes shape, the culmination of our shared dreams and efforts is becoming tangible. Parts are steadily emerging from the manufacturing line, each embodying the hard work, dedication, and passion poured into this project.",
      "We are incredibly thrilled to announce that after two intense years of relentless hard work, and a final sprint spent in the factory for the last month, we\u2019ve finally completed our first batch of the MOMENTEM grinder!",
      "We know you\u2019ve been eagerly anticipating this update, and we\u2019re more than happy to deliver this great news - international shipping officially started on Monday!  We cannot thank you enough for your unwavering patient and support during these two years as we poured our hearts and energies into creating the MOMENTEM grinder. Your belief in us was our driving force, and we\u2019re beyond excited to see our product making its way to you.",
      "Again, coffee is community. Throughout I'M NOT A BARISTA and MOMENTEM's development, we have recieved overwhelming support from the global coffee community. Thank you for believing in our projects and our mission, and for wishing us success every step of the way.",
      "At I\u2019M NOT A BARISTA, we made it our mission to celebrate, acknowledge, and appreciate the craftsmanship of baristas around the world. Between the grueling working hours and underwhelming wages, baristas can\u2019t seem to catch a break, and yet they consistently allow us to take one from our busy lives by making our favorite cups of coffee.",
      "We might be new to product engineering, but we're diving right in to launch something brand new to revolutionize the manual grinding industry. We're here to launch the conversation on the potential of hand grinder design, breaking barriers between vision and production, to give coffee lovers a new experience for their daily brew.",

      "HARDSTYLE Supplements enters the market as a premium yet affordable option. While other products may compromise on quality or charge exorbitant prices, HARDSTYLE\u2019s commitment to providing a superior supplement at a reasonable cost ensures accessibility to a broad audience of fitness enthusiasts.",
      "HARDSTYLE\u2019s primary target audience includes athletes, bodybuilders, gym-goers, and fitness enthusiasts of all levels who value a holistic approach to performance enhancement. By catering to this diverse demographic, we aim to establish Hardstyle Supplements as a trusted brand across the fitness community.",
      "With the growing demand for natural and transparent supplements, we project a steady increase in market share over the next few years. HARDSTYLE Supplements\u2019 competitive pricing strategy positions Hardstyle Supplements as an attractive option, further supporting our growth projections.",
      "Background / Introduction",
      "Pre-workout, a subset of the supplement industry, is made of ingredients taken prior to exercise and is designed to help optimize focus, strength, and endurance during exercise. Pre-workout has become extremely popular since the early 2000s, and the industry has been growing steadily in recent years as more and more people are becoming interested in taking supplements to boost their workout performance.",
      "With the rise of social media, and the corresponding increase in fitness role models, the pre-workout market has grown significantly, and there is only room for further growth in the industry.",
      "According to a 2023 Mordor Intelligence Report, the pre-workout supplement market is valued at $20 billion as of 2024 and is estimated to grow to over $25 billion by 2029. That is a whopping 20% increase in the next 5 years.",
      "Problems in the Industry",
      "Pre-workout supplements often contain unnecessary, mislabeled, or inaccurately dosed ingredients, some include high doses that may be harmful, many are overpriced, some are falsely marketed by steroid users, and products are frequently inappropriately marketed towards children.",
      "According to a Research Letter posted in JAMA\u2019s Complementary and Alternative Medicine in 2023, as many as eighty-nine percent of dietary supplement labels are inaccurate.",
      "THE SOLUTION",
      "HARDSTYLE Supplements is a quality, affordable, and effective all-natural pre-workout supplement designed for athletes, bodybuilders, gym-goers, and fitness enthusiasts looking to enhance their workout with increased endurance, focus, and energy, while being able to push their limits during workouts to achieve maximum performance. Hardstyle Supplements provides a carefully crafted combination of effective natural ingredients to maximize performance without unnecessary additives, mystery blends, or undisclosed quantities of ingredients. The combination of specific caffeine extracts allows for balanced, long-lasting effects while preventing an energy crash following a workout.",
      "HARDSTYLE Supplements believes in transparency as a cornerstone of trust and discloses all ingredients with their respective dosages, allowing users to make informed choices about what they put into their bodies. No proprietary blends, no hidden secrets \u2013 just complete honesty - from a GMP certified facility.",
      "As a bodybuilder for the past several years, I have tried numerous different pre-workout supplements and have fine-tuned my formula to include only those ingredients that have maximum impact and beneficial effects. Each individual ingredient serves a specific purpose. There are no unnecessary added ingredients or fillers in any of HARDSTYLE\u2019s products.",
      "PRE-WORKOUT INGREDIENTS - Vitamins",
      "PRE-WORKOUT INGREDIENTS \u2013 Amino Acids",
      "STIMULANT INGREDIENTS BACKED BY SCIENCE",
      "Caffeine is known to boost various aspects of exercise performance, muscle strength, and endurance, according to the International Society of Sports Nutrition, but can be problematic for some individuals. The maximum recommended daily dose of caffeine is 400 mg for the average adult. Recognizing that many individuals will use 2 servings of pre-workout prior to exercise, HARDSTYLE Supplements pre-workout provides a safe amount of caffeine, 225 mg per serving.",
      "STIM-FREE INGREDIENTS BACKED BY SCIENCE",
      "THE COMPETITION",
      "HARDSTYLE Supplements takes a bold stance in a crowded industry, where top competitors such as, Bucked Up, Gorilla Mind, Optimum Nutrition, Total War, and Ryse fall short. Recognizing the risk of flashy gimmicks, hidden ingredients, and suboptimal blends, HARDSTYLE is committed to crafting a superior product by meticulously addressing the shortcomings in its competitors\u2019 formulations. From eliminating proprietary blends to ensuring the perfect balance of ingredients, HARDSTYLE sets a new standard for pre-workout supplements. Unlike competitors who compromise on transparency or include unnecessary additives, HARDSTYLE focuses on effectiveness, providing a meticulously researched formula that maximizes performance without compromising health. In a market flooded with subpar options, HARDSTYLE Supplements stands out as a beacon of innovation, quality, and authenticity, delivering a pre-workout experience designed to exceed the expectations of fitness enthusiasts seeking optimal results.",
      "MAJOR CHANGES WITHIN INDUSTRY",
      "Over the years, pre-workout has become more relevant in the supplement industry and extremely popular among users of all ages. The industry has undergone several significant changes and trends in recent years, driven by shifts in consumer preferences, regulatory updates, scientific advancements, and the evolving health and wellness landscape, including many individuals seeking vegan options.",
      "The FDA has increased its scrutiny of dietary supplements. This includes stricter enforcement of good manufacturing practices, enhanced labeling requirements, and more rigorous health claims and advertising oversight.",
      "THREATS WITHIN INDUSTRY",
      "The regulatory environment for dietary supplements can be complex and subject to change. Scrutiny from regulatory authorities can lead to increased compliance costs and limitations on marketing claims.",
      "High-profile cases of safety concerns or questionable marketing practices can lead to negative media coverage that erodes consumer trust and confidence in supplements.",
      "The supplement industry is highly competitive, with numerous brands and products vying for consumer attention. This can make it challenging for new entrants and smaller companies to establish themselves.",
      "Unauthorized or counterfeit supplements sold through unregulated channels pose risks to consumer safety and can undermine the industry's reputation. HARDSTYLE acknowledges these threats to our customers and have worked to create something that is optimal for working out and overall health.",
      "OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN INDUSTRY",
      "As the global population ages, there is a growing market for supplements targeting age-related health concerns, such as bone health, joint support, and cognitive function.",
      "The fitness and sports nutrition segment continues to expand, with more consumers adopting active lifestyles, leading to increased demand for pre-workout supplements that enhance performance without compromising health.",
      "Pre-workout use is a global market and expected to continue to grow across the US, Canada, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and other countries. HARDSTYLE has an opportunity to expand globally to reach a diverse consumer base.",

      "In western astrology, the story of Pisces involves 2 fish (Venus and Cupid) that tie each other with a string to swim away from the mythological monster Typhon. I represent this story in my kinetic sculpture that uses a single nylon string bound between 2 motors creating beautiful standing waves.  As the string spins endlessly, it is illuminated by stroboscopic LED lights creating beautiful displays of colors and shapes that are both mesmerizing and therapeutic to look at.",
      "Lamp in Black color (Volcanic Lightning mode)",

      "Lamp in White color (Tango mode)",
      "The LEDs strobe (turn ON and OFF) to illuminate the spinning string at regular intervals.  By capturing periodic points in time of where the string was and wasn't, it creates an illusion of the string taking on many different colors, or splitting into many strings, or dancing erratically, and many more effects.",
      "The string rotates 60-90 times per second and the lights strobe at specific intervals to create unique patterns",
      "Each lamp has been programmed with 11 different color patterns, each one vividly unique from the others:",
      "\"Northern Lights\" mode simulates auroras",
      "\"Tango\" mode creates 2 strings that dance together endlessly",
      "The lamp also generates a gentle draft current for circulating air around a small room.  A faint hum (similar to a small fan) surrounds the lamp as the string rotates 60-90 times per second creating a white-noise and ASMR-like ambiance.",
      "Table setting",
      "Taking into consideration the aesthetics, I\u2019ve designed it such that it fits in a variety of settings that can normally fit a traditional lamp.  At 16x6x6 inches, it's not too big nor too small to be placed in a bookshelf, on a nightstand, on a fireplace mantle, on a work desk, on a side table, as a centrepiece, in a cubby, in a reception area, etc.  The ambient light show illuminates the surroundings in an innovative way that is sure to draw eyes and start conversations in any setting.",

      "When my first campaign, Aquarius, was created, I had already set up a plan on launching 11 more products (each one based off a Western Zodiac symbol).  I was reminded of a childhood toy which demonstrated the standing waves concept and thought to myself that it can be a fitting representation of the story of Pisces.  If anyone is curious, here's a look at the toy that inspired this (you might still be able to get one on eBay for about 100-200 USD if you're lucky):",
      "However, times have changed and technology has advanced significantly.  The original product did not use strobes, was not intended to be a lamp, had problems with string winding, was limited in the modes it provided, and was not home-decor friendly.  I adapted the idea into a product that can be situated in a home setting and also applied what I learned from Aquarius regarding stroboscopes.  The end-result was a kinetic sculpture that acts as an innovative lamp, a symbolic representation of Pisces, and a beautiful demonstration of art & science.",

Origami is inspiring groundbreaking advancements in engineering and design.",
      "Our patent-pending origami pattern is compact and space-efficient, with rapidly deployable synchronized panels, which makes it ideal for photovoltaic applications.",
      "We spent years researching alongside NASA's engineers and understanding how they employ origami for deployable-space-based solar arrays that compactly stow for launch yet provide a large surface area when deployed in orbit and beyond. This experience inspired us to completely rethink its earth-based application.",
      "Credit: Compliant Mechanism Research Group - Brigham Young University",
      "Solar power gives you the versatility and independence to power your devices off the grid. Solar provides you with the reassurance of energy self-sufficiency, energy security, and reduced reliance on fossil fuels.",
      "We designed the Sego Charger to withstand the punishing physical and environmental conditions you face during outdoor adventures and off-grid situations.",
      "We built the sleek and transportable solar charger we want to rely on when camping, hiking, and preparing for the unexpected.",
      "A modular connector box makes it easily compatible with any portable power bank, power station, and USB electronics.",
      "The Sego Charger's groundbreaking design combines the structural strengths of rigid permanent solar panels with the portability advantages of folding panels.",
      "We have completely redesigned the terrestrial solar module, creating a revolutionary architecture that maximizes space optimization, portability, compactness, and ruggedness with the durability and rigidness characteristic of permanent solar arrays.",
      "Efficiency: SunPower\u00ae solar cells are the leading photovoltaics on the market. These cells capture more sunlight than conventional monocrystalline cells because their grid-line electrical contacts are on the cell's rear, making them more efficient at absorbing maximum sun.",
      "Durability: SunPower cells are also durable. They incorporate a solid rear copper back that reduces fractures and resists cracks, preventing performance loss.",
      "Performance: Unlike standard monocrystalline cells, SunPower cells utilize upgraded redundant electrical connections, resulting in more consistent power output in shading than normal monocrystalline cells, which can lose significant output or stop working altogether if a panel is partially covered.",
      "Robust joints are crucial. They are vital for a stable, long-lasting panel that can fold and unfold thousands of times.",
      "A folding panel with sturdy joints maintains stability and prevents the wobbling and flopping typical of portable panels. Robust joints distribute weight evenly and provide a solid connection between the components, ensuring a reliable and secure structure.",
      "The strong joints enable a smooth folding mechanism and ensure the folding process remains fluid and effortless.",
      "ETFE (Ethylene Tetrafluoroethylene) is the premier solar panel laminate. ETFE has excellent light transmission properties, which results in increased energy generation and higher efficiency for the solar panel.",
      "Resistant: ETFE is highly durable and resistant to environmental factors such as UV radiation, weathering, and temperature fluctuations. It can withstand extreme weather conditions (hail, snow, and high winds) without significant degradation.",
      "Self-cleaning: It also has low surface energy, which means it has a self-cleaning effect. This property helps to minimize the accumulation of dirt, dust, and other contaminants on the surface of the solar panel. As a result, ETFE-coated panels require less frequent cleaning and maintenance than different panel types.",
      "Lightweight: ETFE is lightweight and flexible. And due to its superior durability and resistance to degradation, ETFE has a longer lifespan than other panel types.",
      "An integrated power charger makes powering devices directly from the charger convenient and straightforward. Charge your smartphones, tablets, cameras, portable speakers, or power banks by connecting directly to the solar panel. Eliminate the hassle of carrying multiple charging devices and streamline the charging process. The multiple charging ports accommodate charging different devices simultaneously.",
      "With robust connectors, cracking from movement and temperature change can be prevented.",
      "Sego utilizes embedded smart programmable magnets to make your deployment and setup flawless. Smart magnets are programmable magnets that transform ordinary magnets into precision-tailored magnetic systems. They are designed to fasten your panels quickly and maintain the rigidity of the panels without the need for manually latching. The smart magnets secure the charger with incredible force and align the electrical connections while minimizing interference with the solar panel. We have customized the engagement forces, enabling you to securely mount your Sego Charger and release it with a simple twist.",
      "Sego is trailblazing innovative solar panel production methods. Our team is dedicated to delivering a quality product with premium materials and the highest-performing solar cells available. The Sego Solar Charger will require significant modifications to traditional solar panel manufacturing techniques - these are not \"off-the-shelf\" solar panels. Our innovative origami pattern with triangular and trapezoidal panels requires pioneering solar fabrication processes to make it possible. Each SunPower cell will be precisely cut (into halves and quarters). PCB (printed circuit board) will reconnect the photovoltaic circuits to maintain the cells' efficiencies.",
      "The Sego Solar Charger is 25 rated watts (following standard industry rating standards). Rated wattage assumes ideal conditions, meaning direct and intense sunlight, mild temperatures, no shading, and perfect panel angle and orientation.",
      "Most portable solar panels have rated wattages in their name (e.g., SolarPanel 20). We've chosen not to follow this convention because it can be misleading. Ideal conditions rarely occur (if ever). Wattage ratings are helpful because they provide a benchmark for comparing different panels; however, they can be mildly infuriating when the ratings are wildly inconsistent with actual wattages.",
      "The SEGO Charger is our first step in accomplishing our vision: driving renewable energy adoption by making solar power more compelling. We are just beginning our journey of transforming how we interact with and use solar power.",
      "We are passionate about bringing space-based deployable solar array technology to Earth. Our team has a history of successfully launching products ranging from carbon fiber travel guitars to naturally occurring bactericidal agents to treat antibiotic resistant-pathogens.

      "We've directly sourced the best cotton, extra-long staple cotton, for maximum softness, breathability, and ease of maintenance. Our cotton fibers are longer than other cotton types, so our socks are softer, more absorbent, and extra durable.",
      "Our threads go through a proprietary process that makes them not only feel more refined, but are also more durable and fray less after each wash.",
      "Our socks are knitted on specialized machines that have 200-needle \"resolution\" for a high definition look and feel, giving you the finest sock wearing experience.",
      "We've integrated just the right amount of synthetic fibers to increase the durability and stretch of our socks. These proportions were optimized so you can benefit from the natural features of cotton, but also enjoy maximum performance.",
      "Thoughtful design means our socks have minimal loose threads on the inside, leading to a smoother sock that lays flat and doesn't leave marks on your feet and calves after daily wear.",
      "We've added high quality Lycra fibers in key areas of the sock so they fit each part of your foot with high precision.",

That's why we're committed to crafting innovative products that not only address these challenges but also nurture the bond between pets and their human companions.\n\nFurspark is more than just technology; it's a bridge that unites hearts across distances.",

      "Through every stage of this project, our process has been about thoughtful, detail-driven work. We\u2019ve considered every aspect of The Desk Lamp\u2019s design, working side by side with experts we trust to create a product that lives with you, as an upgrade to your daily routine. It\u2019s a story our founder tells best.",
      "The Desk Lamp will be offered standard in black, white, or silver.",
      "The Desk Lamp is available with a specialized Task Light or a Task Light AND Webcam Light. The Task Light has asymmetric light output, which is cast down and directs the light beam to a selected area for focused work. The Webcam Light is forward-facing and used for video conferencing.",
      "Task Light\n With a CRI (color rendering index) of 98+, this version of The Desk Lamp has the ability to reveal the most brilliant colors on a par with the color spectrum of natural sunlight. Its tunable-white LEDs can shift color temperature from 1650 to 8000 kelvin, perfecting the color settings to align with various environments or even the time of day.",
      "The optical design of The Task Light and Webcam Light was refined and calibrated over countless hours. Each Lamp style features high-quality LEDs with a rated life of more than 100,000 hours. For added energy efficiency, there is a proximity sensor on the lamp head that automatically shuts off the light when you leave. The Task Light\u2019s optical design was optimized to provide total workspace coverage without monitor glare.",
      "Inside The Task Light\u2019s lamp head, LED diodes are recessed \u215c\u201d to hide the source from direct view, reducing visual fatigue for the most comfortable experience. There is currently a patent pending on our optical technology.",
      "You\u2019ve never seen a desk lamp move like this one.

One thunderbolt port, one USB-C port, one USB-A port, two HDMI ports, and two built-in wireless charging pads equipped with Qi-certified technology provide 20 watts of power to charge multiple devices simultaneously. Connect your laptop or desktop computer, up to two displays, external hard drives, and other mobile devices to create a workspace that\u2019s customized to you. Power to the lamp comes from a low voltage USB-C port on the back of the base allowing it to function in any country or voltage around the world.",
      "9 to 5 office work. 5 to\u2026 all-night gaming and livestreaming. Video conferencing. Photo editing. Content creation. There\u2019s no shortage of uses for The Desk Lamp.

      "While working at Amazon, Mobile Pixels, Inc.\u2019s co-founder, Jack, was constantly frustrated by the lack of a secondary monitor that could help him work more efficiently. Feeling strangely nostalgic about the work monitor he used at his previous job, he decided to build a laptop monitor from a broken laptop. Soon, everyone in the office wanted one, and our product, DUEX, was born!",
      "DUEX launched on Kickstarter in June 2018 and almost immediately went viral, raising over $1 million on Kickstarter and Indiegogo combined. TRIO launched on Kickstarter in June 2019 and raised over $1.6 million.",

      "Time to take on the journey.",
      "Human missions to Mars is not a new idea throughout the humankind history. The possibility of human missions to Mars has been being studied since 1950. The same goal is shared among many government space agencies including NASA and ESA. NASA even topped its priority over moon mission in 2010 expecting a manned Mars mission in the 2030s.",
      "The dial is certainly the most ambitious move of Mars Mission. A 3D Mars coated with red Swiss luminescent Super-Luminova is implanted in the centre of the dial. Upon light absorption, the implanted 3D Mars glows in reddish iron in darkness. The implanted Mars is filled with aluminum, covered with embossing techniques to create a rugged surface effect. The dial is surrounded by 3D indexes to further energize the watch. Random Brush technique together with vintage effect is applied onto the dial ring to resemble the rocky appearance of Mars.",
      "\u201cHow are the Hands assembled?\u201d This is the most commonly asked question we faced in the past year and the reason why countless hours were spent in the development process. Instead of following the existing norm like others, our designer has embraced the technical challenge with the revolutionary idea - placing the Hour Disc underneath the 3D Mars and the curvy Minute Hand on top of the 3D Mars. Via the glowing 3D Mars in the dark, the shadow of Minute Hand laying on top tells the minute while the luminescent-coated Hour Disc underneath tells the hour.",
      "The frustum-like crown is etched with layers of scaling grids. The design concept comes from the unique appearance of NASA\u2019s Orion-MPCV. The Orion-MPCV is a NASA spacecraft built to take humans farther than they have ever gone before.",
      "Simply by looking at the wrist, wearers could find where the case perfectly joints with the Sapphire Crystal. This concept is derived from the UFO\u2019s streamlined design. The 43.5MM case Diameter is fitted with 316LStainless steel material to demonstrate the perfect scale design. Inspired by \u201cThe Mars Rover Concept Vehicle\u201d by NASA, both sides of the case are embossed with a unique honeycombed pattern.",
      "A blue sunray dial is assembled into the case back. Through the skeleton case back, you could take a glimpse and enjoy the rotor movement. This design is derived from the solar arrays of NASA\u2019s Insight Mars Lander. The Mars Mission logo is etched through in the centre of the case back.",
      "The craziest ideal comes to the thrilling reality as the Sapphire Crystal curve exquisitely accomplishes the case angle like a dream. It forms an almost seamless curve on the dial. The double-layered dome is made of raw European Sapphire materials following by a special cold grinding procedure to achieve such an extreme curve. In order to reduce excessive reflection, the crystal is treated with an anti-reflective coating which enables wearers to read the crystal clear dial from any angle.",
      "A huge enhancement is made in the movement. Mars Mission is powered by NH70A movement from Seiko. This automatic movement features a hacking function. (A hacking function means the second hand stops when the crown is pulled out.)",
      "This Seiko NH70A movement is credited for its reliability and fair accuracy in automatic movement which makes it one of the most popular automatic movements in the industry.",
      "A soft and tender leather strap handcrafted with German nylon stitching lays comfortably around the wrist. Three selected strap color options (distressed black, bronze and ash grey) are offered to go with your choice of different dial. We believe you would enjoy the combination. A lot of thought was put in the leather material selection. We come up with two special options; one is natural Full Vegetable leather which looks organic and effortless, good in durability and strength while the Crazy Horse leather option delivers a vintage vibe with unique and real texture.",
      "Leather strap with quick release-spring bars",
      "Packaging is one key part of our product design. Mars Mission comes with a deluxe box embossed with Mars Missions 3D initial \u201cMM\u201d on top. Each box carries a detailed and delicate instruction manual complemented with a metallic warranty card.",
      "That's why we could never stop to create new designs. What we have, it's your amazing compliments to our previous campaigns!!",
      "We stand firmly behind our watches; OVD offer a 2-year limited warranty on Mars Mission which covers movement manufacturing defects. The warranty does not cover damages that may occur from wear and tear and daily use. For more information please see www.ovd.com.hk",
      "This is our fifteenth year in the manufacture of high quality-watches, and we have been designing and developing unique timepieces for many of the world's leading brands for 15 years. In addition to development and design, the most important point is that the components procurement and production processes are all handled by ourselves. With this advantage, we can guarantee that the campaign would not have serious delays in delivery, and we believe that it can be delivered successfully.",
      "We are obviously counting on the courier service to take excellent care of our precious package. Global reach and local teams ensure fast delivery with end-to-end tracking.  Please be ensured that Importing duties and fees are the responsibility of the backers.",
      "OVD was started from a passion to push the boundaries of design and create unique, yet affordable timepieces. Mars Mission is one of the most important campaign with high confidence for us in this year. Now all we need is your great support!!",

      "This is the WARMEST and most VERSATILE beanie that you will ever wear - with even more features and abilities!",
      "Packs to the size of a golf ball (stuff sack will be included)",
      "Why Invest in a Down Beanie?",
      "Our heads are up to 5x more sensitive to temperature changes compared to other parts of our body. Therefore, it's essential to keep it warm and protected in cold climates.",
      "We've long used knit beanies, but they tend to be itchy, inconvenient to pack away, and susceptible to strong winds.",
      "Often we forget them at home because they're relatively bulky and don't fit into our pockets or take too much space in a purse.",
      "Our previous project to address these issues, the Tatsu, became the most backed beanie on Crowdfunding history ever. After delivering thousands of pieces in the past year, we've learned a lot from the feedback we've received. And by tweaking and tinkering with new ideas, materials, and manufacturers, we're now ready to introduce the result.",
      "Think of it like an ultra-lightweight, extremely warm down jacket for your head.",
      "With the Air, we strove to provide a more comfortable fit while introducing nano-coated, water-resistant down for even more weather resistance.",
      "The pattern is inspired by Japanese designs, and we've incorporated advanced materials and construction techniques to produce an even higher performance product.",
      "What hasn't changed is our commitment to help under-served youth discover the outdoors and become future stewards of our environment.",
      "We're continuing to only use RDS-Certified (Responsible Down Standard) goose down that has been independently verified to ensure cruelty-free treatment of the animal.",
      "Our 700 Fill Power Goose Down is rated higher (which means it's warmer and lighter) than certain recognized brands' jackets, and this grade of down feather can only be found in larger, more mature animals. This premium FP offers an incredible combination of warmth and packability.",
      "F\u00dcRST's specially treated down features a Permanently-Bonded Water-Resistant Coating. This nano coating enhances the natural hydrophobic nature of goose down to ensure additional protection against the elements.",
      "Down is one of best insulators known to man. High quality goose down offers unparalleled versatility and comfort across a wide temperature spectrum. Compared to other beanies you might own, you'll stay warmer at lower temperatures, and it'll weigh a lot less too!",
      "Our ultra-fine 20 denier nylon is made of a tight weave of silky soft fabric that naturally blocks the wind and provides strong protection against water. It\u2019s also the perfect balance between durability and lightweight protection, allowing the down to loft to its maximum potential.",
      "Even as the weather warms up, or as you engage in strenuous activity, you'll stay comfortable longer without having to remove and store your beanie. The Air Beanie is breathable thanks to microscopic perforations in the material small enough to resist liquid water droplets, yet large enough to vent water vapor (your sweat moisture) for it to escape",
      "The Air beanie is also lined with a moisture wicking sweatband that keeps your head dry longer even if you work up a sweat.",
      "Weighing in at just 1 oz (29 grams), the Air beanie can practically vanish as it\u2019s able to compress down to roughly the size of a golf ball. Once it's no longer needed, you can easily stow it away in a pocket or to your purse. This makes it perfect for everyday carry, so you always have it available on hand.",
      "After hundreds of hours of development, and many revisions and prototypes, we're excited to present this product, but we still need your support to make the project a success. A pledge of any amount, however small, will mean a lot to us:",
      "We can't thank you enough for checking out our project and helping us make the Air Beanie a reality. We know not everyone will be able to support this campaign with a pledge, but if you support what we stand for, please help us spread the word by sharing on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Reddit, and other media.",
      "When properly cared for, your F\u00dcRST Air Beanie can last for decades. Periodic cleaning will help your down beanie last longer and perform at its best.",
      "Machine-wash",
      "Hand-wash",
      "Drying",
      "Down is a tough performer against the cold, but when thoroughly soaked (even with the Air's nano-coating), it'll require a little extra attention to ensure it doesn\u2019t get damaged.",

      "\u2022 Submicron resolution\nThe resolution capacity of optical microscopes is constrained by both interference phenomena and the wavelength of visible light. Achieving resolutions in the hundreds of nanometers, which align with the wavelength of visible light, poses a significant challenge. Like the iMicro Q3, the iMicro Q3p reaches resolution levels at the submicron scale. The following micrograph shows a pattern on a chromium photomask used in the production of integrated circuits (ICs). This pattern includes line pairs with varying line widths, ranging from 0.25 to 1.5 microns. Impressively, the iMicro Q3p lens can resolve line pairs as small as 0.75 microns. This is evident from the gray intensity plot, which clearly illustrates the distinct pattern, serving as compelling evidence of its exceptional 0.75-micron resolution.",
      "\u2022 Extremely high magnification: up to 1200x\nThe iMicro Q3p represents a remarkable advancement in magnification capabilities, building upon the impressive foundation and optical excellence of the iMicro Q3.",

      "\u2022 Very low distortion: Comparable to a desktop microscope\nWe used a grid calibration target to test the distortion. No noticeable distortion was observed, even at the edge of the visual field.",
      "\u2022 Enhanced contrast and colors with the polarizing function\nPolarized light is a contrast-enhancing technique that improves the quality of images obtained from birefringent materials, such as crystals, minerals, and liquid crystals. The polarized light microscope is designed to observe and photograph specimens primarily due to their optically anisotropic character. Some samples have weak contrast under a standard microscope. The following micrographs of crystals from urine and a thin polymer plate deformed for demonstration purposes show how cross-polarizers can make details clear. This provides a solid demo for identifying sample details and defects in products.",
      "\u2022 Extremely low profile and weight: \u00bd inch and ~1/60 oz, easy to carry\nMeasuring just about the size of a fingertip and weighing a mere 0.5g (~1/60 oz), the iMicro Q3p boasts an incredibly slim profile, measuring a mere 3.2mm (1/8 inch) in thickness.

Using an ingenious, reusable nano-suction pad, these lenses seamlessly attach to your phone. Whether your device features a single rear camera or multiple, flat or extruded, these diminutive round lenses are crafted to match your smartphone's camera setup.",
      "\u2022 The Magnification\nMagnification in a Fingertip Microscope is different from that of a traditional microscope. The conventional compound microscope uses a sophisticated optical system comprising objective and eyepiece elements. The overall magnification arises from the combined effects of these two components.",
      "In the case of our Fingertip Microscope, a three-stage magnification process culminates in achieving total magnification. Initially, the lens instigates optical magnification, generating an image on the smartphone camera sensor. Subsequently, this image on the sensor is projected onto a significantly larger screen through electronic processing and further magnification. Lastly, digital zoom contributes an additional level of magnification, enhancing the image through digital means. The synergistic outcome of these three stages yields the total magnification in our Fingertip Microscope, showcasing the harmonious convergence of optical and digital techniques.",
      "The traditional polarizing microscope has a complex structure. Especially, a polarizer and another polarizer (analyzer) are added before and after the specimen in the optical system. For iMicro Q3p, we mimic this polarizing structure but keep it in a small profile.",
      "\u2022 Development Path and Process\nOur journey to develop these smartphone-based microscopic tools began in 2012 when we first registered our patent.

Snoring occurs when the airway narrows during sleep, causing vibrations and resulting in the sound of snoring. The YA50G helps to prevent snoring by delivering positive airway pressure, either in continuous mode or auto-adjusting mode, which keeps the airway open and maintains regular breathing patterns.",
      "Please note that the YA50G device is not designed for medical purposes and does not provide any medical advice or treatment. The device is intended solely to help improve your sleep quality and overall well-being. It should not be used as a substitute for professional medical advice or treatment, including CPAP therapy. Our Campaign Perk is not a CPAP machine and is not designed or intended to be a replacement for one. If you have any health concerns or medical conditions, please consult a healthcare professional before using this product.",
      "YA50G is designed for people who want to enjoy high-quality sleep anytime, anywhere. Its compact size (14.3 x 9.0 x 5.4 cm) and lightweight design (320 grams) make it easy to carry in a handbag or backpack.",
      "Unlike larger and bulkier machines, the YA50G can be easily carried in a handbag or backpack without taking up too much space or adding extra weight. It is also designed to be user-friendly, with a simplified humidification system that requires no water and an intuitive app that helps you track your sleep health data. With the YA50G, you can enjoy a quiet and comfortable sleep without compromising your lifestyle or travel plans.",
      "The SnoreCircle chip is equipped with an intelligent algorithm that constantly monitors the user's breathing and adjusts the air pressure settings accordingly. It can detect changes in the user's breathing patterns and adjust the pressure in real-time to provide the most comfortable and effective therapy.",
      "SnoreCircle YA50G offers two modes - continuous mode and auto-adjusting mode, so you can experience personalized comfort and a restful night's sleep. Our intelligent algorithm and customized modes ensure a peaceful sleep for everyone.",
      "The benefit of having two modes is that it provides greater flexibility and customization options for users. Users can choose the mode that works best for them based on their breathing patterns and personal preferences. Additionally, the ability to customize therapy modes ensures that users receive the optimal pressure settings to prevent snoring and maintain healthy breathing patterns during sleep.",
      "YA50G is equipped with advanced sensors that can detect even the slightest changes in your breathing pattern throughout the night. This state-of-the-art technology has been rigorously tested and calibrated to ensure that it provides accurate and reliable monitoring of your breathing events, including snoring, hypopnea, and sleep breathing. With this level of sensitivity and precision, you can trust that YA50G is working to provide you with the most effective and personalized sleep therapy possible.",
      "The headgear is made of skin-friendly material, while the nasal mask is designed according to ergonomics, with a pneumatic rebound silicone pad that features a gradual thickness design, providing both comfort and tightness.",
      "The YA50G's mask (including headgear and frame) weighs only 53.3g. The mask is designed to perfectly fit your face, ensuring customized comfort and a peaceful night's sleep.",
      "The 1850mm tubing provides the flexibility and freedom of movement you need to sleep soundly in any position.",
      "YA50G comes with additional tubing connectors that allow for seamless compatibility with all standard international tubing sizes (15mm and 22mm inner diameter), providing the freedom to use your preferred tubing and mask for maximum comfort.",
      "HEM (Humidification without Electricity and Maintenance) technology is a cutting-edge humidification system used in the YA50G device. This technology enables the device to provide effective humidification without requiring water or electricity, making it a more user-friendly and low-maintenance option.",
      "With HEM technology, the device uses a specialized humidification pad to absorb moisture from the user's exhaled breath and deliver it back to the user during inhalation. This process helps to prevent dryness and irritation in the user's airways, which can lead to discomfort and even respiratory problems. Additionally, by maintaining optimal humidity levels, the HEM system can improve the effectiveness of the positive airway pressure therapy provided by the device.The YA50G device is designed to operate quietly during use, thanks to its advanced noise reduction technology. With a pressure level of only 30dB and a power level of 37dB, the device operates at a very low noise level, making it virtually silent.",
      "The low noise level of the device has several benefits. Firstly, it allows users to sleep more comfortably without being disturbed by loud machine noises. This is particularly important for users who are light sleepers or have sensitive hearing. Secondly, the low noise level can also help to improve sleep quality by reducing the amount of noise pollution in the sleep environment. This can result in more restful and rejuvenating sleep.The YA50G device is designed to work seamlessly with the accompanying app, which offers a range of customizable features and real-time data tracking. With the app, users can customize their therapy settings and view their sleep data to monitor their progress.",
      "One of the key features of the app is its ability to track and record real-time sleep data, providing users with a detailed understanding of their sleep patterns and quality. The app provides users with a sleep quality score, which is based on factors such as sleep duration, snoring, and respiratory events. This score can be used to track progress and identify areas for improvement, helping users to optimize their sleep quality over time.",
      "With the YA50G's intelligent auto start/stop function, you can easily turn the machine on and off by simply putting on or taking off the mask. The device detects your breathing flow and automatically starts running when you wear the mask, and turns off when you remove it, providing you with a hassle-free and convenient experience. You can also control this function via the accompanying app for added convenience.",

      "It was a challenging time for us and everyone in the world. As you may recall, it was around the same time that US-China relations were not at their best, the pandemic was out of control with new deadly strains, and the supply chain experienced disruptions globally. We certainly felt that stress through the delayed shipments of raw materials and high import fees.",
      "Nevertheless, we battled against all of that for our first launch. We had no prior investors, significant budget, or experience producing \"Smart Heated Apparel\" since it was the first of it's kind and still is to this day. Whatever obstacle was thrown our way or fell upon our heads, we simply extracted the kinetic friction as energy and powered through with determination.",

The one and only new thing is the luxurious style of Vegan Leather Gloves, Slim Winter Jackets, and Vests, which we have developed with a focus on medical conditions during our R&D phase.",

All that is waiting right now is for us to give the green light and papers to our manufacturer to produce the units and bring warmth to people, even in the world's coldest areas.",
      "The last challenge that we experienced last time was timely delivery, which is common in launching new products and something we had prepared for. Unexpected obstacles still delayed our shipments. However, we managed to deliver just in time for the Fall/Winter season, so it was not a failure!",

      "The reinvention of your classic marble track as design object - because fascination knows no age!",
      "A 360\u00b0 design object perfect for any desk at home & in your office.",
      "We incorporated those effects into a modern, natural and minimalistic aesthetic to create a completely new 360\u00b0 design object. With MARBOLOUS, you\u2019re able to interact with design.",
      "Marble tracks are either expensive collector's pieces, which easily cost several thousand dollars or they are cheaply made from simple plastic.",
      "MARBOLOUS offers an innovative marble lifting system, integrated within the 360\u00b0 metal track, dust protected under a glass dome \u2013 making movement a tangible experience and creating a completely new, interactive design product.",
      "We used solely high quality materials as well as the team's decades of experience in engineering and product design to built MARBOLOUS to last. Here are some nerdy details we are proud to share with you:",

      "MARBOLOUS ELECTROLL",
      "The mechanical lever of the MARBOLOUS Classic has been modified in the ElectRoll into a three-way switch. Choose between Interval Mode, Motion Sensor or OFF.",
      "When the motion sensor is activated, the marbles are lifted and rolled down the track whenever someone walks past your MARBOLOUS. Ideal settings to place this include your home entrance, your open-plan office, or wherever a lot of movements come up. And this option still enables you to interact with it, which is key for our design products - just a wave of your hand in front of the sensor and the marbles start rolling!",
      "In interval mode, a marble is triggered every minute. You can enjoy the movements of the marble without having to be active yourself, or, use the ElectRoll MARBOLOUS as a minimalist clock. For example, exchange every fifth marble for a different color, so you know that 5, 10, or 15 minutes have passed when the marble color changes. This can also ideally be used for the Pomodoro technique. Truly, the options are endless!",
      "The stackable tracks come in two shapes which we call \"Brezel\" and \"Anti-Brezel\" (you know, Germans and our love for pretzels).",
      "Marble tracks are mostly expensive collector\u2019s pieces \u2013 and even barely available:",
      "MARBOLOUS is designed and engineered for everyone.",

      "You can choose between four different MARBOLOUS Editions with different base, track and marble colors.",
      "Who has the choice is spoiled for choice: The White Edition looks light and forms with it's black marbles a beautiful contrast. The Black Edition, on the other hand, looks more serious and vigorous.",
      "Those who prefer natural tones can further choose between the light Birch Edition or the dark Walnut Edition.",
      "Baffy & Jan have known each other from a very young age and bonded over- you guessed it \u2013 marbles. After the first wave of the pandemic, they decided to create a product that lets you dip into the careless days of your childhood while sitting at your desk.",
      "\u201cBaffy quit his job as COO at one of the fastest growing clean tech companies in the world, to pursue his dream of sharing his passion for marble tracks. He is currently splitting his time between his family and MARBOLOUS.\u201d  - Jan",

      "Design Sketch:\nIt all began with a simple sketch\u2014a vision of the perfect EDC knife. From the very first lines on paper, we focused on blending minimalism with functionality, crafting a design that would feel natural in the hand and fit seamlessly into everyday life.",
      "Initial sketch",
      "Line Drawing:\nOnce the initial design was set, we translated the sketch into precise line drawings, where we refined every curve, angle, and dimension. This stage ensured that the proportions were just right and that the design would translate into a usable, ergonomic tool.",
      "3D Modeling:\nWith the line drawing as our blueprint, we created detailed 3D models, allowing us to visualize the knife in full depth. This step was crucial for evaluating ergonomics, handle shape, and blade geometry, ensuring that every element of the design was optimized for both form and function.",
      "3D modeling",
      "3D Printing:",
      "With the help of 3D printing technology, we created multiple prototypes for physical testing and functional verification. User feedback was invaluable, guiding us to make further improvements. We iterated on the design, optimizing ergonomics, aesthetics, and the overall user experience.",
      "3D printing",
      "3D printed product",
      "Prototype production:",
      "Eventually, after numerous rounds of testing and refinement, we successfully crafted a final prototype that embodied our vision.",

      "The traditional toothbrush has two critical flaws. First, it is home to millions of bacteria, including fecal matter. We're not okay with our toothbrush being dirtier than our toilet seat, and we're willing to bet that you're not okay with that either. The second flaw is that the traditional toothbrush is far from being carry-friendly. Tired of carrying your toothbrush in a plastic bag? So were we.",
      "We have spent the past 2 years redesigning the toothbrush from the ground up to create a toothbrush that keeps itself clean and minimizes size so that you can take it anywhere.",
      "The Switchbrush opens and closes seamlessly with the push of a button. With each close of the head, the UV light is activated to disinfect your brush head. Keep it in your purse, backpack, or anywhere else you'd like and it'll be germ free every time you brush. Brushing with water you don't trust in a different country? No need to throw your brush away after your trip. The Switchbrush will sanitize your brush upon returning and in between each brush while you're there.",
      "We built the Switchbrush for people who live their lives on the go. Why? We are travelers, campers, and guys who want to brush their teeth halfway through a good date. It is important for us to have a toothbrush that is easy to take with us, wherever we're going.",
      "UVC disinfectant technology has been used since the early 1900's to disinfect drinking water in countries throughout Europe. UVC sanitation deactivates harmful microorganisms through a physical process in which wave lengths penetrate the bacteria. When bacteria and viruses are exposed to UV light, they are unable to reproduce.",
      "UV light even works against organisms responsible for cholera, polio, typhoid, hepatitis and other bacterial, viral and parasitic diseases.",

      "Yup, its that simple.",
      "The American Dental Association recommends replacing your brush head every 3-4 months.  \"Toothbrushes have been shown to harbor bacteria (including fecal coliform bacteria that can be released into the air when the toilet is flushed or can be spread to the toothbrush when the owner touches a contaminated surface before handling his or her brush)...\"",
      "Jeklo recommends that you adhere to the ADA recommendation to change your brush head every three months, but not for fear of germs. Newer bristles brush better and are less harsh on your gums. So take care of your mouth by getting a replacement head, and Switchbrush will make sure your bristles are sanitized until you do.",

      "The Switchbrush comes with a wall charger that conveniently magnetizes to the body of your brush. The brush charges quickly and lasts for over a week's worth of brushes.",
      "Traditional tooth bushes are awkwardly long and require additional products to protect your bristles. There are products on the market to cover your toothbrush head, and recently, other products have come along to sanitize your toothbrush. The Switchbrush effectively combines your toothbrush, your cover, and your sanitizer into one commonsense solution.",

    "allParagraphs": [
      "The comic book spinner rack from our youth -- at an amazing price. And now it disassembles!",
      "...I was a kid running after school on Tuesdays and Thursdays to McNamara's Drug Store to buy the newest comic books.  The Gold Key, Classics Illustrated, Harvey, and other comics sat on a large wooden magazine display. But the Marvels and DCs were proudly presented on two comic book spinner racks that formed the backbone of my comic book memories.",
      "Decades later, I purchased two spinner racks when I was running Innovation Publishing; they didn't quite have the graphics topper I remembered, but close enough. I'd schlep those racks to and from our minivan to the convention floor, usually scraping up my hands and arms in the process because the original shipping boxes were long gone.  But I loved how our comics looked displayed on those racks, both at Conventions and in my office.  I still have those racks, one of them in my office until recently showing off some of the comics Glass House Graphics produces for our clients.  I've spray painted it several times, oiled the bearings, and cursed the squeaking sound it makes because of a long-missing plastic piece that fit the pole.",
      "...Why the hell didn't someone make an AFFORDABLE comic book rack that could be easily taken to conventions -- and be assembled and disassembled so it wasn't cumbersome to carry?",
      "I mean, I looked on Etsy and eBay and discovered, IF they sold any comics spinner rack at all, it was insanely priced at $1,200.00 (just the rack, without the base and pole) to $1,500.00 each (complete, yet offering pickup only no shipping option).  Seriously insane!",
      "So, I checked Diamond Comic Distributors, and they theoretically sold one for $400.00 IF it was in stock (as I type this, it's not) plus shipping that could be $100 to $200 depending on where you are. Still a 6-foot monster box to transport, that meant basically SIX HUNDRED BUCKS for a comic rack, IF you could get it. Still insane!",
      "I contacted suppliers in the USA and all over the world to see if anyone still made the classic rack I was looking for.  Nobody did.  A few suppliers sold versions of a rack that just didn't look right. Nobody seemed to offer either version of the spinner rack long burned into memory. Some offered to build a custom rack. I was fine with that and gave specs. Then I discovered that SHIPPING from them to me, or drop-shipping from them to you, was between $150 and $200 for one rack!  That's crazy.  Nope.  Not happening.",
      "Then I thought about all those Conventions where I cut up my hands and arms and scraped up car seats and even damaged my dashboard trying to wedge comic racks into my car.  Enough of that!",
      "What If I designed a full-sized, 40-pocket spinner rack, with the long-remembered classic design, that could be taken apart and easily transported in a wheeled carrier?  SO, I DID!",
      "I kept a close eye (sometimes both eyes!) on the manufacturer building the prototypes --",
      "After we tweaked and fiddled and painted, it was ready.  It was a thing of beauty right from my childhood.",
      "I was pleased to discover that my redesign allowed me to ship the rack for about one-third of the cost UPS/FedEx/DHL/USPS quoted me for shipping the original rack design.  That meant I could simplify life for everyone by offering the spinner rack bundled with FREE USA SHIPPING!  What's more, we could offer economical shipping to Canada and most of Europe.",
      "I even worked with our manufacturer to select an optional, properly sized canvas carrier with three wheels for stability, to make the schlepping simple!",

      "FIRST, A BIT ABOUT SHIPPING: Thanks to canny craftsmanship, careful package planning, and a whole lot of dumb luck, we found a shipping \"sweet spot\" that allows us to offer this Spinner Rack with U.S. shipping included in the price. What's more, shipping one rack to Canada only adds $25 to the total. And we can ship it to much of Europe for only $25 over that. AND we now can ship to Australia for only $80. Unfortunately, that shipping \"sweet spot\" does not extend to shipping to the rest of the world so I'm offering it to the countries where we can. DISCLAIMER: I have no control over Customs in any country, nor the upcoming administration's planned Tariffs, so I cannot predict or accommodate how they will affect/handle overseas shipments.",
      "PRODUCTION & TIMEFRAME: The examples you see in the photos and video are the prototypes made from my design; I'll be fine-tuning certain elements until production begins. The manufacturer drop-shipped the prototypes to me so I could see them boxed the same way you'll receive them. Our timeline is to ship in June 2025 for delivery in July. The manufacturer has assured us that production will only take 8 weeks, but we've padded the release schedule with two extra months to deal with any difficulties. Manufacturer will drop-ship directly to you, saving time and money. Only the T-shirts and such will be shipped from my office warehouse.",
      "Long-lasting design",
      "Powder-coated steel and dual-supported ball bearings should give this 21st Century Comic Book Spinner Rack long life, just like the original classic racks you remember.",
      "Reusability and recyclability",
      "The plastic bags and foam packing are re-usable when you break down the rack for transport. The double-box we ship to you can be re-used or recycled. Or both.",
      "Something else",
      "By drop-shipping to you directly from the manufacturer instead of shipping to a warehouse and re-shipped, we're saving time, money, and transportation resources for literally tons of freight.",

      "Get your pupillary distance (PD) in a matter of seconds. Patent-pending frames & smartphone app.",
      "EyeQue PDCheck\u2122 is the fastest and easiest way to obtain your pupillary distance (PD). Pupillary distance is the distance between your eye\u2019s pupils in millimeters (mm). While not a medical record, PD is used for ordering eyeglasses, whether in-person or online. Without a good PD the glasses will not feel good and can cause blurriness and dizziness.",
      "More and more people are looking for the elusive \"PD\" number, yet existing solutions are stuck in the 1990s-- Most establishments suggest using a \"printable ruler\", but this is hard to use and may result in inaccurate measurement. There are also smartphone apps that use a credit card positioned under your nose, but this not only exposes your credit card number, but it is notoriously inaccurate.",
      "Introducing the EyeQue PDCheck. Our specially designed frames and smartphone app work together to produce accurate PD measurements that's as easy as taking a selfie (literally!) or a picture of a friend.",
      "The PDCheck works like a charm! We've been giving demos all day and here are some images and videos from the show. Enjoy!",
      "Ordering eyeglasses online is becoming more and more popular \u2013 and for good reason; superior selection, low prices, and incomparable convenience. But often people are missing one critical number necessary to get a great fitting pair of glasses.  Your PD is often left off your standard prescription and is difficult to obtain yourself without proper equipment and tools.",
      "If the PD is wrong, you will find the glasses uncomfortable, often resulting in blurry vision, dizziness, and headaches.",
      "To clarify, you will still need an eyeglass prescription (or the like) when ordering glasses online. An eyeglass prescription is an order written by an eye doctor, such as an optometrist or ophthalmologist, that specifies the value of all parameters necessary to construct and dispense corrective lenses. PD is an element of getting great fitting glasses, but is not a medical record, nor is it required to be provided by your doctor.",
      "A sample prescription:",
      "The PDCheck gives you all the PD you need.",
      "In addition to the common PD, also know as \"distance PD\", \"interpupillary distance\", or \"binocular PD\", the PDCheck also provides two additional PD measurements:",
      "Monocular PD, shown in the format of (R:xxx, L:xxx): This is the measurement from the middle of your nose bridge to your right or left pupil. While the right and left PD is usually within 1mm to 2mm of each other, some of us may be less symmetrical than others (>2mm difference)-- And noting this number will result in better fitting glasses.",
      "Near PD: This is the PD for reading vision. Our eyes tend to converge a bit when looking at things close-up. If you are ordering reading glasses, this number will help you get the best fit possible.",
      "Yes, you can use the PDCheck to get your PD for your favorite VR headset. Forget the silly paper ruler-- The PDCheck is great when you play with friends.",
      "Accuracy",
      "Our patented PDCheck technology uses the smartphone camera to take a \u201cselfie\u201d and extracts the PD to an accuracy of +/- 1 mm.",
      "There are mobile apps out there that have you use a credit card or paper printout held against your forehead or under your nose. These simply do not work well due to many factors including the shape of your head, and the fact that it is hard to take a selfie and hold the card in the correct position. PDCheck includes a special set of lensless eyeglass frames. The T-marks on the frames provide an accurate reference used to determine the distance between the center of your eyes. By wearing the frames, your hands are free to get a great selfie and the T-marks are near your eyes in precisely defined location. PDCheck works with both the front and rear cameras of your phone, so you can either take your own picture or have someone else take a picture for you.",
      "The idea is simple yet robust\u2013 and easy enough for anyone to use.",
      "The patent-pending EyeQue PDCheck Frames have three \"T\" marks; two near each edge and one in the center. The PDCheck mobile app uses image processing the detect the locations of the T-marks, as well as the pupils of the user.  As an added layer of accuracy assurance, once the picture is taken, the user has the opportunity to adjust the location cursors (green \"+\" signs), making sure that they fall on the T-marks and pupils. The result is an incredibly accurate PD measurement, rivaled only by in-person measurements at office visits.",
      "Check out how it works-- In real time!",
      "We take your privacy very seriously. The EyeQue PDCheck app never saves or uploads your photo image; your picture is removed as soon as we compute the relevant parameters needed for calculating an accurate PD. The PD measurement instantly displays on your mobile phone and is stored securely in the EyeQue Cloud\u00ae in your personal account \u2013 ready to be retrieved whenever you need it and accessible from desktop and mobile.",
      "If you are using other EyeQue products, such as the Personal Vision Tracker or the EyeQue VisionCheck, the PD will automatically show up as a part of your EyeGlass Numbers.",
      "Step 1: Download and launch the PDCheck app on any Android or iOS smartphone.",
      "Step 2: Put on the PDCheck frames",
      "Step 3: Take a selfie or have a friend take your picture. Make sure your face, and the PDCheck Frames, are within the oval on your phone screen.",
      "Step 4: Make sure that the green markers are directly on the \"T\" marks on the frames AND on your pupils. Adjust the locations of the marks if necessary.",
      "Step 5: Hit \"confirm\" and you are done! You will receive two pupillary distances: 1) your PD \u2013 the combined distance of each pupil from the center of your nose, and 2) your Near PD (reading vision, since our eyes tend to converge while focusing close-up). Access your data anywhere, anytime on your PDCheck app or by logging into your personal account at www.eyeque.com.",

    "allParagraphs": [
      "Easiest way to consistently make great pour-over coffee, with less than 30 seconds hands-on time.",
      "An innovative coffee brewer design that revolutionizes the pour-over coffee brewing method. It uses ground coffee's natural tendency to swell in hot water to consistently get great coffee.",
      "This could be the biggest development in pour-over since Melitta Bentz started it all, over 100 years ago.",
      "Is it over for traditional pour-over?",
      "Definitely not! But it's fantastic to have a pour-over brewer that requires almost no time, special attention, or pouring technique.",
      "Your everyday pour-over brewer?",
      "Probably yes! It's the brewer you can rely on every morning to effortlessly make great coffee.",
      "Simplicity is beautiful! This thought drives us everyday.",
      "Making coffee should be simple. But it seems to be getting more complicated every year!",
      "If you love the ritual of a manual pour-over, watching a siphon brewer do its thing, or drinking a latte with a swan on it \u2026 that\u2019s cool.",
      "But we are about reconnecting with the beautiful simplicity of coffee \u2026 it\u2019s just ground coffee and hot water.",
      "We set out to make the simplest coffee brewer that gives the quality of an artisan brewed pour-over, with minimal effort and no special brewing or pouring technique. By using the natural swelling of ground coffee, and encapsulating it in a deceptively simple brewer, we achieved this.",
      "You will get great quality coffee - every time - with less than 30 seconds hands-on time.",
      "Because all the coffee is made uniformly wet at the same time, and because the coffee expands to close any possible channels as carbon dioxide bubbles escapes from the roasted coffee, there is no need to do a pre-infusion phase - often called the 'bloom'.",
      "CO2 bubbling up - no 'bloom' needed",
      "The carbon dioxide harmlessly bubbles through the water while the coffee is brewing - like a soda. There is no risk of uneven extraction caused by channel formation, because as the coffee expands it closes out any micro-channels that start to form.",
      "The brewer is carefully designed so that the amount of stainless steel is perfect for chilling freshly boiled water to get it in the range of 195\u00b0F to 205\u00b0F, as recommended by the National Coffee Association and the Specialty Coffee Association.",
      "This means there is no need to preheat the brewer. And you don't need a temperature-controlled kettle.",
      "With less effort than it takes to use a coffee machine, you will get great quality coffee with every brew.",
      "It's the Simple Smart Coffee Brewer (or SSC Brewer).",
      "We addressed the entire user experience during the design process. We looked at every detail. From use, to clean-up and storage we have ensured that the brewer is a delight to use.",
      "For instance, when you are adding coffee to the brewer you rest it on the lid, so that any coffee 'fines' that pass through the filter do not end up on your kitchen surfaces. And when you have finished the brew, you can rest the brewer on the lid to catch any coffee drips.",
      "Clean and easy to use",
      "Storage needs are minimal. If you have space for a cup, you have space for the brewer. It's perfect for use in a tight kitchen, an office, or a dorm.",
      "Minimal storage space",
      "Clean-up is a breeze. The brewer is dishwasher safe. But it's very simple to just rinse out and wipe dry.",
      "Simple clean up",
      "The robust design and small size mean that it is perfect to use as a travel brewer. Anywhere that you can get hot water, you can make great coffee!",
      "Easily transported and used anywhere",
      "Because you can easily use it anywhere, you can have one at home and one at the office, to ensure you can enjoy great coffee whether you're relaxing or working.",
      "Use at home and at work",
      "The packaging the brewer comes in is designed to be reused, which is convenient for storage and for transporting the brewer. Image below is a prototype.",
      "Reusable packaging for storage or travel use",
      "It really is the best way to get consistently great pour-over coffee with minimal effort. The perfect way to start your day.",
      "The easiest way to make pour-over coffee.",
      "If you put the in same amount of coffee, with the same grind size, you'll get the same cup of coffee every time. You do not need any skilled brewing or pouring technique.",
      "As you make the coffee one cup at a time, you can make it to suit individual tastes. If your partner likes  a strong, dark roast and you like a medium roast, a little less strong, that's no problem.",
      "If you select the SSC Brewer Partner Pack as a perk, you can both get coffee just the way you like it.",
      "Partner Pack Perk - Ideal for coffee loving couples",
      "The prime filter in the SSC Brewer is the coffee. The encapsulated coffee forms a uniformly dense and thin coffee bed as the coffee expands. This is perfect for getting an even brew.",
      "The laser cut holes in the brewer control the flow rate to give a well-balanced brew.",
      "It is designed to be used without any additional filters. But, if you want to, you can modify your coffee by adding secondary filters by using the Adaptor. This does not affect the extraction, which is only controlled by the brewer design and the coffee used. The exctration is completed before the brewed coffee touches a secondary filter.",
      "The Adaptor is also used to allow different coffee cup diameters to be used - up to 4\" outside diameter.",
      "You can use the 200 micron metal filter in the adaptor to remove more visible grounds.",
      "If you want to remove all the 'fines' and most of the coffee oils - that are extracted as emulsions rather than being dissolved in the water - you can use the small individual paper filters.",
      "Adaptor and optional metal or paper filters",
      "If your home grinder produces a lot of 'fines' you can add a tertiary (third) filter by simply stacking two adaptors with paper filters (you will need to purchase an additional adaptor for this). Too many 'fines' can cause the first paper filter to 'clog', which allows some coffee to pass through the air/overflow holes in the adaptor. The tertiary filter (the second paper filter) filters this 'pass-through' coffee to give the cleanest cup possible.",
      "Paper filters after using tertiary filter",
      "The 'clogging' of the first filter paper filter does not affect the quality of the coffee as is does with traditional pour-over, as the flow-rate is control by the stainless steel and coffee, not the paper filter.",
      "Whether you prefer the full, rounded, robust brew you get just using the coffee as a filter or the cleanest, brightest coffee from using two paper filters, you can get coffee just the way you like it.",
      "We set out to create a simpler, quicker, and more reliable way to get pour-over quality coffee. We did not set out to try to improve the taste of the coffee. But the testers we have been working with over the last 12 months, have often reported getting a 'better' cup of coffee. The most common comment is that it is less bitter.",
      "We have not done any rigorous and controlled testing, so we are not claiming you'll get a 'better' tasting cup of coffee. For a start, it depends what you are comparing it with. And there\u2019s also the possibility of confirmation bias playing a part. But we thought it appropriate to share this information and offer an explanation why you might experience a slightly different flavor profile compared to a traditional pour-over.",
      "We suspect the difference is to do with the coffee:water contact time. Even though the total brew time with the SSC Brewer is very similar to a traditional pour-over ... maybe a touch longer on average ...the water that sits above the filter plate does not mix with the coffee as is the case with a traditional pour-over. You can see below that the water is virtually clear.",
      "SSC Brewer with clear water above filter plate.",
      "Coffee/water slurry in traditional pour-over.",
      "The water is only in contact with the coffee as it passes through the shallow coffee bed (roughly 7mm thick) that is encapsulated between the filter plate and the filter body. This is normally about 30 seconds (in the 25 to 40 second range).",
      "As it takes longer for water to extract the bitter compounds from the coffee, this reduced contact time might be an explanation of the reported taste.",
      "Please note that this is our best hypothesis - not a proven fact.",
      "If you go ahead and start using the SSC Brewer, we'd love to get your feedback on the taste,",
      "The Simple Smart Coffee Brewer was designed so that you do not need any additional equipment to use it.",
      "You just need something to boil water in that you can pour into the brewer. A simple kettle is the obvious option.",
      "You certainly don't need to buy a special gooseneck or pouring kettle. Nor do you need a temperature-controlled kettle. You don't need scales or timers to measure the amount of water you have added.",
      "No need for pouring kettles",
      "Several people that have been testing the Simple Smart Coffee Brewer have stopped using typical drip coffee machines (or even French Presses). They found that they got better quality coffee from the SSC Brewer and it was easier to use.",
      "Also, they reported that there was no wasted coffee and the clean-up was far easier.",
      "It's important to note that the expected life-time of the SSC Brewer far exceeds the typical 5 to 10 years of a coffee machine.",
      "SSC Brewer much longer product life",
      "As the coffee is made directly into the cup, there is no need for any carafe that needs to be cleaned and stored.",
      "The SSC Brewer has a deceptively simple design, But there are many points of detail that have been incorporated into the design - such as having the silicone components act as protection whilst shipping.",
      "Here are a few illustrations of this attention to detail.",
      "Positioned to control flow-rate and, therefore, extraction.",
      "To create tight fit between plate and body.",
      "To allow air to enter the filter body as it drains.",
      "To ensure air can escape from cup as coffee flows in.",
      "Prevents spillage if fines choke paper filter & prevents seal with cup.",
      "To ensure lid stays cool for lifting filter.",
      "Our guiding principle of 'simplicity' significantly affects our design approach.",
      "We believe it is a simpler experience for the user if they never have to replace the product, or any of its parts. So, this is one of the reasons we work to create products that 'Strive to be Immortal'.",
      "We have used materials that should not degrade and become unusable over decades. We have used food grade silicone and 304 Stainless Steel. Both materials are expected to last decades.",
      "We have not used any plastics in the product. To be clear, silicone is not a plastic. It is a synthetic polymer of silicon, oxygen, hydrogen, and - in food grade silicone - carbon. Importantly, it does not breakdown into microplastics.",
      "There are no pressure seals, that always eventually require replacing during a product's life.",
      "We have designed out as many points of potential failure as we could. This is why the lid also acts as a 'handle' to lift the brewer when hot, if needed.",
      "There is only one manufactured joint- where the handle is triple-welded to the filter plate.",
      "We only provide the silicone in a brown color. Coffee will stain silicone over years of use, so we selected the color it would end up after years of exposure to coffee oils.",
      "To keep our business simple (we apply the same simplicity principle to our operations) we do not offer a warranty on the SSC Brewer.  We will, of course, honor any return policy of any sales channels we use.",
      "The design is such to make any warranty of negligible value to customers, given the modest price of the brewer and the incredibly low probability of any issues arising over any reasonable warranty period.",
      "Our policy is to do individual quality assurance on every brewer before it is ships from our facility in the USA.",
      "Concern about the environment is the second reason we work towards products that 'Strive to be immortal'.",
      "There are many positive environmental points to consider about the SSC Brewer:",
      "Given the environmental benefits, it is clear that there are costs savings associated with selecting the Simple Smart Coffee Brewer. Compared to traditional pour-over, typically,",
      "Single Use Coffee Machine",
      "If you use a machine that uses pods or k-cups, the annual savings can be quite significant.",
      "For instance, a couple that uses k-cups, with both drinking 2 to 3 cups of coffee a day each, would save about $600 a year by switching to the Simple Smart Coffee Brewer. That's just of coffee cost! (Based on price of Peets Major Dickason's Blend - prices as taken from Amazon August 2024 - K-cup $0.64 each, loose pre-ground $0.78 per ounce. SSC Brewer typically uses 0.4 oz per cup of this coffee, so saving per cup is 32,8 cents. At 5 cups of coffee per day for a year this equates to $598.60.)",
      "And you'll get a better tasting cup of coffee!",
      "The stainless steel components are production versions made on molds that are ready for a full mass production run, This is also the case with the silicone lid.",
      "Through rigorous testing  over the last year plus, we developed a better design for the Adaptor that can accommodate more cup internal diameters and manage issues associated with 'fines' in the ground coffee. We will be keeping the same overall dimensions, but changing the air/liquid flow paths. This will have no impact on the production schedule.",
      "The only other open issue we have is to finalize the packaging design, which again, will have no impact on the production timescales.",
      "We asses that the main risks associated with this project are related to logistics. This is one of the reasons we have decided to undertake an Indiegogo launch with shipping to the USA only.",
      "The other two reasons for this are:",
      "We expect to be shipping the first perks to our backers in November/December 2024.",
      "Update 11/4/24 - the estimated delivery date is now January 2025.",
      "Once we have reached the funding target we will be able to share more precise dates.",
      "Our funding goal will enable us to place an order for the minimum order quantity, as agreed with our manufacturing partner, and to modify the design of the Adaptor (as outlined above).",
      "As we have been testing production versions of the brewer for over a year now, we do not see any exceptional risks over those of normal business operations.",
      "Free shipping USA",
      "As we intend the SSC Brewer to be a direct-to-consumer product, we always want to be able to quote an 'as-delivered' price. Therefore, shipping is included in the Perks prices.",
      "Simple Smart Coffee Brewer",
      "Includes:",
      "Optional Items",
      "If you are using ground coffee from a grinder that produces a lot of 'fines' or if you simply want to have a third filtering step, we suggest that you purchase an additional Adaptor.",
      "The Standard SSC Brewer comes with 10 paper secondary filters, for demonstration purposes. If you want to buy additional paper filters you can order the packs of 200.",
      "Third Party Items",
      "Metal filters, with different filtering hole dimensions, are readily available. If you want to experiment with a different grade than the 200 micron version we supply, there is no reason you can't purchase these from another supplier.",
      "We strongly recommend that you use the SSC Brewer Filters, because of the grade of paper used (26 gsm). The 2.5 inch diameter paper filters are the same size as those from some other suppliers (normally listed as compatible with 'Aeropress'). These other paper filters  are designed to have the coffee forced through using a plunger based brewer. They will not work with the coffee being drawn through by gravity alone, as is the case with the SSC Brewer.",
      "Ray Priddle - SSC Brewer Creator, \u201cI am so excited to share this design with people. I hope that a little added simplicity in their lives adds to its sanity ... and they still drink great coffee.\u201d",
      "Annette Foster - Customer Connection, \u201cI\u2019ve loved using the SSC Brewer as a tester for over a year. I cannot wait to get these to customers and hear their feedback.\u201d",
      "Ray Yan - Manufacturing Coordinator, represents and organization that has over 20 years experience manufacturing high quality stainless steel products.",
      "Corinna Makris - Communications Consultant, \u201cI am so delighted to help share such a great product with the coffee community. I've abandoned my French Press ... the SSC Brewer is my daily route to great coffee.\u201d",

      "We also offer a variety of add-ons that can be used with the OmniPro Tool. It's important to note the difference between tritium tubes and glow tubes. Tritium tubes provide a constant glow without the need for charging, as they are self-illuminating and can last for many years. On the other hand, glow tubes need to be charged by an external light source and their brightness diminishes over time. Please consider these differences when choosing the add-ons that best suit your needs.",
      "From the inception of the OmniPro project in September last year to its launch this June, our journey has spanned nine months. Finally, we're ready to go live! If all goes well, we anticipate shipping to commence by October, with the latest delivery expected by November. We'll diligently adhere to our project timeline and maintain open communication with everyone. Feel free to reach out anytime if you have any questions or concerns.",

      "What is Innway tech and what can you do with it?",
      "INNWAY TECH",
      "What are some of Accent's smart design features ?",
      "SMART DESIGN FEATURES",
      "FIND YOUR PHONE - Press the Innway button, the letter \"a\" with the Innway signal logo, on your Accent and your phone rings, even if your phone is on silent! Have you ever had to ask someone to call your phone so you can find it? Accent's got it covered.",
      "FIND YOUR WALLET - Use the Innway app to make your Accent ring. Say goodbye to your wallet hiding in the sofa or any of its usual hiding places at home.",
      "LAST SEEN LOCATION - The Innway app marks the last location it saw your Accent on the map, so you can navigate back to where you lost it to increase the chances of you finding a lost wallet. When you are back in range and your phone reconnects with your Accent, you can make it ring to find it.",
      "RECHARGEABLE BATTERY - The Accent has a long battery life that lasts at least 6 months, so you only need to charge it twice a year! A completely drained Accent takes only 2 hours to be fully charged, so it can get right back to work. The Innway app will notify you when your battery is low to remind you to charge the Accent.",
      "CARD RELEASE - Pull the quick-release trigger to pop your cards out. Our patented release mechanism is almost instantaneous but holds the card firmly so they won\u2019t fall out, even if you hold the Accent upside down. The cards only come out when you pull the out by hand, and they just slide out.",
      "In fact, you don't even have to take your cards out. Why take them out and risk misplacing the cards? Scan with your card without having to take it out of the Accent, and then push it back when you're done.",
      "CASH QUICK DRAW - Our innovative design lets you take cash out of the Accent without having to fully open it. Count the cash with ease and pull out the notes you need.",
      "RFID SECURITY - The card holder is RFID/NFC protected to block any malicious attempts to skim your cards.",

      "To show our gratitude, we are bundling our popular Innway products with the Innway Accent at special Kickstarter prices.",
      "The Innway Card turns traditional wallets into smart wallets, and many users have been asking for a wallet that comes with Innway tech built in.    Instead of just making a smart wallet that comes with built-in Innway finder function, we created a smart wallet with a smart design.",
      "We recently upgraded the charging cable for our Innway Card and Chip. With the feedback from our users and tests done by our engineers, we gained a lot of insight on about how to improving the charging clip. With the Accent, we designed a new clip to with the added thickness of leather so the charging pins fit snugly on the contact points.",
      "1. Built-in Bluetooth finder",
      "The Accent comes with our Innway Bluetooth finder technology built directly in the wallet. Other brands in the market partner with third party solution so they have less control over the app, and often need to make compromises to make the hardware fit in their product. We designed the hardware together with the wallet for maximum performance and compatibility.",
      "2. Rechargeable battery",
      "Unlike other wallets in the market that require you to remove the finder to charge it, the Accent is has a rechargeable battery that lasts at least 6 months, so you only need to charge it twice a year. It takes a mere 2 hours to get a full charge. The Innway app will remind you when the battery is running low, so you can ensure the Accent is always juiced up.",
      "3. Innway expertise",
      "The Innway team consists of experts with years of experience in both Bluetooth finder hardware and software. Our intimate knowledge of the industry empowers us to create products that address the shortcoming of the offerings available in the market, while removing superfluous features that are more marketing gimmicks than practical functions. Since the Innway tech is an in-house solution, we are in full control over the features and direction of the product.",
      "4. Affordable price",
      "If you buy an Innway Card and a wallet separately, you'll end up spending a lot more than getting just the Innway Accent that is a wallet and has the Innway tech built-in. A retail price of USD 99 is very affordable for a premium artisanal leather that comes with the Innway function built in. The Innway Card alone retails for USD 39. We are offering the Accent at 55% off retail price only during our Kickstarter!",
      "5. Proven track record",
      "We have been selling the Innway Card on Amazon for over a year and we have thousands of happy users who often tell us how thankful they are because our product helped them time and again.

      "It all started back in 2019 when two highly skilled and proficient design thinkers got together to discuss some ideas. We were just discussing some random and fun ideas as two fellow engineers and designers until a switch suddenly flipped inside our heads. We immediately decided to get to work and draw some sketches. In the end, we came up with a few designs, and that marked the official birthday of Magnapot.",
      "The idea behind Magnapot was to create a playful kit of parts that can engage the user in imagining, connecting, and playing. It is kind of a Lego-inspired design that invites others to play and build. That is why we think it could be a dynamic sculptural piece.",
      "We also wanted to modernize the antiquity of pottery, clay, and ceramic without losing its authenticity and we added chromatic magnets. Thanks to the magnets, Magnapot can grow infinitely.",
      "We had already run a successful campaign in Kickstarter back in 2016, so we immediately knew how to introduce Magnapot. However, we also knew that we shouldn\u2019t offer anything but the very best for those who put their trust in us, so we immediately began producing prototypes and asking our friends, family, and fellow engineers for opinions. It took us 2 entire years to perfect our initial design. After all, we had to personally oversee everything, and make sure nothing is short of perfect. Finally, after two years, we\u2019re here.",
      "We, the Magnapot team, believe in curiosity and play. We create things that we desire to see out there in the world, and we do all of this with love. Collectively, we are a bunch of academics, system designers, and builders. We have over 20 years of design, manufacturing, supply chain, and fulfillment experience. We are very well familiar with the process of bringing a new product into the world, and the importance of being in communication with customers and making sure everything is going smoothly up to the very last step, which is delivering the product to your hands. All we want to do is bring a bit of joy and playfulness to your life.",
      "CREO is a design innovation company based in San Francisco, California. As a group of passionate designers and makers, we believe that good design is useful, beautiful, and even playful. We designed Magnapot with such principles in mind and would like to share that with you. We wanted to create something that can be used in many ways and many configurations so everyone could use and enjoy it. We are also obsessed with quality products and are bringing to you exquisite quality in handcrafted ceramics.",
      "We have done all of our homework to date. This includes all phases of prototyping, completing test production here in the Bay Area to figure out any possible pitfalls, meeting with several manufacturers, and securing a globally top-tier manufacturer with a proven track record and exquisite production quality and accountability. We have set it all and we already have a solid plan. However, there may be unseen circumstances, such as the current pandemic that nobody saw coming back in January. One of the risks is that the current COIVD-19 pandemic takes a turn for worse and imposes restrictions on manufacturing and trading. As of now, our manufacturer is working in full production mode, and there is no concern for any delays or issues. Our promise to you is that at every stage of the project, we will work diligently with integrity to make sure nothing goes wrong or that nothing is beyond our schedule. Also, we promise to be effective communicators, and if something unforeseeable happens that may cause delays, we will communicate those issues to you with transparency while working hard to solve them.",

The result was extraordinary.\nToday we want to recreate their intuition by continuing the project they have started by mixing the best components with great design at an affordable price.",

      "Bringing our brand to life from Indiegogo is essential.",
      "Direct-to-consumer sales already allow for a completely different price calculation in favor of the end customer. Launching a watch under crowdfunding terms further reduces the overall cost since the production quantities of each model are established before production even begins. This eliminates overproduction and significantly reduces marketing costs and eliminates all the extra costs  that are involved in traditional sales.\nThe direct sales model will enale us to get a much lower price for the customer and using the Indiegogo platform will lower our costs,  effectively eliminates these middlemen, in turn reducing overall costs while offering huge discounts on every model.",
      "The enormous recharges that the big brands apply can push prices as high as 3000% compared to the production cost as there are normally many intermediaries and marketing costs to pay, so with our direct sales model customers can save up to 50% and benefit from our rewards scheme.",
      "One of the main concerns, however, for Indiegogo backers was that many new companies had no history. And so there was a fear that even if a project reached its goal and gets fully funded  , the items never make it to production and buyers would not see their watch! due to technical difficulties or manufacturing issues or the usual startup issues that new companies face.",
      "We are confident our watches will meet the deadlines as we already done the pre production fixing all the minor issues and we only need to start the main production and ship them.",
      "Warranty",
      "Coverage: All Jacques ARMAULD watches come with an international manufacturer\u2019s warranty that covers defective workmanship for 24 months from the date of purchase. If any manufacturing or assembly defects occur during this period, your watch will be repaired free of charge.",
      "Exclusions: The warranty does not cover:",
      "Normal wear and tear",
      "Damage from improper handling or misuse",
      "Cosmetic or accidental damage, including scratches or marks on the case finish, lens, case back, or strap",

      "RISKS AND CHALLENGES",
      "Unlike most Indiegogo projects, we've been working on Jacques Armauld watches for years prior to this campaign launch. Our team had solved all problems and challenges.

      "Help Us Create a Sustainable Tourism Hub in the Heart of the Pamir Mountains!",
      "I was born in the breathtaking Pamir Mountains of Tajikistan, where the town of Khorogh rests like a gem cradled by majestic peaks. From an early age, I was enchanted by the rugged beauty of the landscape, the vibrant tapestry of native legends, and the soulful rhythms of our traditional and ceremonial music. In 2007 I immigrated to the United States to formally study the art of filmmaking. Since then, I have returned to Khorogh and the broader Pamir region each year, driven by a passion for researching, documenting, and celebrating the often-overlooked traditions, lifestyle, and artistic expressions of my people.\nWith every return, I witnessed the growing presence of international travelers \u2014 wanderers drawn by the same untouched beauty and cultural richness of Khorogh. Conversations with these visitors revealed a shared longing: to preserve the pristine environment and to learn from the indigenous ways of living in harmony with nature. These heartfelt exchanges became the seeds of a vision \u2014 to create a space where culture, sustainability, and community could flourish.\nThus was born the idea of building glamping barns and an artisanal caf\u00e9 \u2014 a sanctuary where stories can be exchanged, traditions honored, and nature revered.",
      "Tucked away in the majestic Pamir Mountains of Tajikistan, Khorogh is a breathtaking gem, rich in natural beauty, vibrant culture, and warm-hearted people. Despite its immense potential to attract global travelers seeking authentic, off-the-beaten-path experiences, Khorog remains undiscovered mainly due to a lack of modern tourism infrastructure.",
      "We envision changing that\u2014sustainably and inclusively.",
      "Our project proposes the development of four beautifully designed glamping barns and an artisanal caf\u00e9, perched just above Khorogh with sweeping views of the valley, only a 5-minute walk from the town center. This initiative will offer a unique eco-friendly retreat for tourists while preserving the region's natural and cultural heritage.",
      "Each glamping barn will be fully equipped with a private kitchen, toilet, shower, and reliable Wi-Fi, blending comfort with rustic charm and environmental responsibility. The art caf\u00e9 will serve delicious traditional food and feature live performances of Pamiri music and dance, showcasing the region's artistic spirit.",
      "But this project is about more than tourism\u2014it's about community empowerment. By creating construction, hospitality, culinary arts, and performance jobs, we aim to provide meaningful employment for local residents, stimulate the local economy, and encourage the next generation to stay and thrive in their homeland.",

    "description": "Real innovative watch with ZERO premade parts. UNIQUE movement and case design you can never find.",
    "company_name": "Jason Chan",
    "allParagraphs": [
      "Real innovative watch with ZERO premade parts. UNIQUE movement and case design you can never find.",
      "Not everyone is striving for a breakthrough in the world of design. For words merely words; to breakthrough requires actions. You need not only 100% of hard work to breakthrough; But you need to devote much more of your time, your vitality, and your finance. Not everyone can accept products that are made outside of the box. But consider this: how can we human beings improve if \u201coutside the box\u201d designs had never existed?",
      "I am JASON(Bios below), a designer who refuses to remain still. Our production line is incomparable with other normal brands; our\u2019s costs money and time. Every part of every watch I designed are made unique, they are specially modelled and manufactured. For I used zero pre-made parts in my watch makings.",
      "This is what innovation is about; this is art. And today, I wish to share my work with you all:",
      "Introducing JW-EX - The Exaggeration",
      "JW-EX is a new beginning; marks a new direction for JW. My first impression of this electronic world is dull; as if we\u2019re missing the mechanics. We who love mechanical watches adore the sensation of metal; the sound of machines running; the excitement of wheels clashing with each other. And so, I thought of Steampunk. Yet you would ask: is this watch really representing steampunk? The answer is no; it is a representation of Future Steampunk.",
      "It may look ridiculous after infusing German\u2019s simple steampunk into the watch, but please look at the result: Such a unique design! The straight lines bring steampunk a sense of futurism, a sense that breaks through the frame of the current generation of watches. It would feel like you\u2019re wearing a robot from the future when you wear JW-EX on your wrist.",
      "JW watch is a watch company founded by Jason Chan (myself) and William Shum from Hong Kong, aiming to create valuable innovative watches with excellent craftsmanship that can be savored by everyone, especially watch lovers.",
      "William has shareholdings in the watch factory and is one of the founders of JW watch. Our factory has more than 30 years of experience in producing mechanical watch movements for SWISS brands. All of our movements are supplied from our in-house factory which guarantees the best quality in movements, stability, and finishing.",
      "*From our finished product JW-01, you can see our persistence in our work. You can also review the Backers' approval and enjoyment of JW-01.",
      "Feel free to click the LINK below for more details:",
      "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jasonwatch/jw-mechanical-designer-watch-jw-01",
      "It is always odd telling the time when it comes to JW watches. But when you look closer, the \u201cred\u201d on JW watches tells the time. I specifically placed the most important time telling part - the minutes - onto the top of the watch. Now you can tell the minutes at a glance, like the indication on an old steam engine.",
      "On the right side of the watch, there is a rectangular sapphire crystal. And within it there lies a red triangular pointer, indicated as \u201cHour\". In this window, you can see the mainspring clearly. When you wind the watch, the mainspring will contract, storing up the energy of 80 hours power reserve.",
      "On the left side of the watch, there is a circular sapphire crystal. And within it, there is a rotating circular plate; that is the \u201cSecond\u201d. At the same time, you may see a heart-beating like balance wheel underneath the plate. This is possibly the most beloved part of the watch to many watch lovers.",
      "Underneath the watch lies an extra crown for winding the watch, which provides comfortability to users. This watch obtains an automatic winding; even if you leave your watch untouched the whole weekend, your 80 hours power reserve watch would be still ticking.",
      "As my co-founder William manages the factory, we can guarantee the best quality movements used in JW watch.",
      "JW-EX watch is powered by an all-new skeleton developed movement called JW-7100, it is approved and loved by many JW-01 backers. JW-7100 functions with a frequency of 4Hz (28,800 A/h), 21 jewels, automatic winding, a sweep second movement, and \u201cCaliber: 173\u201d (173 parts). Functionally, the movement provides up to 80 hours (3 days+) of power-reserve via a single barrel system along with its effective bi-directional winding rotor. It will be difficult, if not impossible, to find a watch with such finely polished movement at this price.",
      "One of the attractions of this watch is the high-quality watch case.",
      "As you can see, there are different cuttings and different polishing in this case: Including vertical brushed, horizontal brushed and mirror finished. Each cutting angle is a process; one after another process is what makes this case worth the money. Every process needs a special set of polishing tools and needs to change the polishing angle each time. Thus, the labor cost of this case is high.",
      "Besides using the 316L stainless steel, we have decided to use gunmetal plating for the sides of the three windows. Although different process raises up the labor costs, it heightens up the quality of the watch. And this is what we persist on \u2013 bringing the best onto your wrist.",
      "Besides, we have put some thoughts on designing the case\u2019s back as well.  I have spent much time on designing the back of the case to make it looks less bulky; it is a challenging task for a designer. A good designer does not only take notice in the design, but also at every angle. You can see that every angle is attractive in these pictures.",
      "Before our final production, we have gone through various trials: using 3D printers to create many prototypes and inviting different volunteers to try wearing the watch. Our goal is to provide a comfortable wearing experience for all of you.",
      "What we need is your support for our MOQ (Minimum Order Quantity); for this production it is 200. Since our funding goal is set higher than before, we do not want to give our second best to you; instead, we want to give you the best. Thus, we persist to create the prototype and present it to you all. Please continually give out your support!",
      "Having an extraordinary and high-quality strap is very important for a watch. It is difficult to make a high-quality strap while maintaining an affordable price. It is, however, my duty to provide the best material for JW-EX. It is our pleasure to have a company that specially produces straps for Swiss Brands to help upgrade our straps. Although their price is higher than before and the MOQ(Minimum Order Quantity) is set higher, I think it is worth it.",
      "Hence, I bring you the finely crafted Italian Calf Leather with an interchangeable catch which allows you to change your strap conveniently without any special tool.",
      "There will be more straps for you to unlock in our stretch goal. Remember to invite your friends and family to support us!",
      "We have already added a new style - the Wild - into our selection and it is from an American leather producer which has more than 100 years heritage in hand-craft manufacturer technique. With its signature softness and uniqueness, it is the best strap we can choose from for you all!",
      "We own a Hong Kong watch factory with watch masters performing quality checks and maintenance for our watches. The quality of JW watch is highly controlled and guaranteed. We will also provide a 1-year international warranty. We are also hoping to unlock our 2-year international warranty goal; however, we need your support to help us to reach all of our stretch goals!",
      "I live in Hong Kong. I am a watch designer, a graphic designer, a photographer, a musician, and a tutor of a design class.",
      "My award: The Hong Kong Exporters\u2019 Association Smart Gift Design Awards 2016.",
      "My previously designed watches:",
      "Stellar Series Imperial: 2017 Hero product of Memorigin",
      "Grand Series: 2016 Hero product of Memorigin.",
      "Stellar Series: 2015 Hero product of Memorigin.",
      "Avengers 2 Series: Memorigin crossover project with MARVEL.",
      "I love designing watches because they are daily products that can show your lifestyle and personality. Also, they reflect your aesthetic sense and ultimately your philosophy. My aim is to make DESIGNER watches with high aesthetic sense. My ideal watch is innovative, beautifully crafted, has great prestige, and is affordable for everyone. I will be applying high-end watch materials (both side sapphire crystal, Italian Calf Leather, stainless steel 316L) and a technology learnt during my 7 years at a watch industry on JW watches.",

      "CalaBassa was born from a shared dream between three friends who wanted to create something meaningful: a product that embodies quality, heritage, and individuality.",
      "What began as casual conversations between us, fueled by a shared love for timeless design and craftsmanship, soon evolved into a mission. The classic moccasin, an icon of elegance and comfort, had become either inaccessible due to high prices or diluted by mass production. We saw an opportunity to bring it back to its roots while reimagining it for today\u2019s world.",
      "Our journey took us across Spain, a country rich in artisanal traditions. Together, we visited family owned workshops, learning from master craftsmen whose expertise has been passed down through generations. Alicante, with its history of shoemaking, became our home base. A perfect place to blend tradition with innovation.",
      "Inspired by the serene beauty of Cala Bassa beach in Ibiza, we infused every pair of moccasins with the Mediterranean spirit. A blend of elegance, vibrancy, and effortless style. The result is a product that not only celebrates the art of shoemaking but also reflects the bond between friends determined to create something extraordinary.",
      "CalaBassa is more than a brand, it\u2019s a celebration of heritage, friendship, and a shared belief in the power of slow, thoughtful craftsmanship. From our hands to yours, every pair of moccasins carries the story of where it came from.",

      "More than just a shoe, it represents cultural heritage, craftsmanship, and elegance that endure through generations. Our goal was to honor this legacy by reintroducing the moccasin to a new audience one that values tradition with a modern touch.",
      "While many legacy brands offer moccasins at prices upwards of $700, we wanted to create a more affordable alternative without sacrificing quality.",
      "By designing, crafting, and refining our own moccasins, we aim to bring back the charm of this traditional style, ensuring it stays relevant in today\u2019s fast paced fashion world. Of course we started with men only moccasins, and if everything goes to accordingly we will expand to women shoes.",
      "Our moccasins are inspired by the serene beauty of Cala Bassa, one of Ibiza\u2019s most iconic beaches. With its soft golden sands, crystal-clear turquoise waters, and the vibrant energy of Mediterranean life, Cala Bassa became the perfect muse for our designs.",
      "Each pair reflects the beach\u2019s harmonious blend of natural tones and lively spirit, capturing the essence of this paradise and translating it into timeless footwear. The result is a unique blend of nature\u2019s tranquility and Mediterranean vibrance, embodied in every style.",

      "Every pair undergoes a rigorous quality inspection to ensure it meets the highest standards.",
      "Handcrafted with meticulous attention to detail, each pair is finished to perfection, blending tradition with modern functionality.",
      "Please refer to the moccasin Size Guide below to find your ideal fit. First, measure the length of your foot in centimeters (From the back of your heel to the tip of your longest toe) and locate that number in the \u201cCM\u201d column. Then, match across the row to see your equivalent EU, US, UK, Japan, Korea (KR) and China sizes.

The competitors offer junky USB powered devices which don't get cold (we get freezing, literally), and few offer the versatility and appeal of a coaster. In our humble opinion, nothing exists in this category of single drink refrigeration.",

That didn't happen with the first prototypes, so we went back to the drawing board (over and over again...). We had to custom design every part to maximize energy efficiency, heat sync surface area, and temperature transfer performance. We finally nailed it.",

As of September 2018, tooling is well underway and samples from the manufacturer are being tested. Soon we will commence final production, and distribution shortly thereafter.",

      "FAQ",
      "What is the diameter of the cooling plate?",
      "2.85 inches (7.24cm), which should comfortably fit the base of any bottle, cup or can.",
      "Is the D.I.C. temperature adjustable?",
      "The chilling temperature is not adjustable. Within about 10 seconds of powering on the D.I.C. via the simple rocker switch, the upper cooling plate will reach freezing temps.",
      "How much energy does it use?",
      "The D.I.C. is designed to be efficient. It will use a maximum of 100 watts, although the average draw is 85 watts. This means that each hour of use is approximately equivalent to $0.01 in electricity cost (assuming the US average cost of 12 cents per kilowatt-hour).",
      "Does it make any noise?",
      "This was a serious hurdle we had during development. The final product is whisper quiet, similar in noise output to a small Apple laptop. It's a faint white noise you would hear if nearby in a dead quiet room, otherwise the sound is generally unnoticeable. The D.I.C. also has rubber feet to eliminate any vibrations.",
      "Is it portable?",
      "The D.I.C. is definitely portable and durable, but it does need to be plugged into an outlet in order to function. A battery would have increased the size and reduced the performance of the coaster, which we decided we didn't want to do.",
      "Does it leave any stains or condensation marks?",
      "Nope, it's been tested on just about every type of surface in many different conditions and has never left any sort wetness, stains, or markings.",
      "Update - September 2018",
      "Final CAD's have been approved and our Injection Molding Factory has begun tooling the custom aluminium, rubber, and plastic parts of the Drink Induction Chiller. Once final samples are approved, we will commence high volume production. Some pictures of tooling are below.",

      "WHAT DO EXPERTS THINK ABOUT KIMLBADE?",
      "There are many advantages of using silicone to make wiper blades. One, it ensures smooth movement and two, it makes sure that the wiper is in constant contact with the glass to apply the water-repellent coating.",

      "KIMBLADE wiper blades are made of silicone and remain intact even when exposed to various conditions, allowing users to experience utmost convenience and safety.",
      "Water repellency is unique to KIMBLADE, as silicone oil and coating is applied with each wipe. Not only does this make driving safer in dangerous conditions, but now there is no need to purchase a separate water repellent for the windshield. This makes it extremely cost-effective and useful for all weather conditions.",

      "KIMBLADE\u2019s Silicone Wiper Technology",
      "The silicone is a relatively soft material, so the other silicone blade in the market which has an inverted triangle structure is bent easily. And so, the downforce is not concentrated and as a result, friction is increased due to extensive contact with the surface of the windshield.",
      "KIMBLADE is supported by its 4-bar linkage structure to ensure the downforce is always concentrated on the edge of the wiper blade without breaking the lip to maximize clear visibility on the road.",
      "At the end of the campaign, please choose the right size of your blades (Driver Side & Passenger Side) by our survey.",
      "Please refer to bellow our wiper blades specification database (this is standard selling in US market.

      "\"Please use this data for reference only and check the right blade sizes and type of arm of your vehicle.\"",
      "Windshield wipers have been on the market for decades, however, the blades have not changed ever since. There are many new versions of the wiper frames, but the blades that directly contact the windshield have had the same design, continuing to cause problems such as noise, weak water-repellency, and inefficient cleaning. KIMBLADE has developed the best, most effective blades and highlights them as the most important aspect of the wiper. KIMBLADE uses silicone, which is much more stable than general rubber. The blades were designed with a 4-bar linkage structure to eliminate the issues that normal wipers produce today. KIMBLADE will ensure a safe view while driving for everyone around the world.",

This is the 3V Aramid Fiber Electric Bicycle, designed with a singular style that adds impressive aesthetics to the world\u2019s first e-bike that is built with Aramid Fiber, the ultimate lightweight and super strong tech fabric that makes this e-bike strong, powerful and safe like no other.",
      "High-end carbon fiber bicycles are favored on the market. However, when a pure carbon frame has a cycling collision, the pure carbon frame breaks into sharp fragments, which is easy to hurt people and poses great safety risks. To solve this problem and develop materials with better performance and more safety, 3V cooperated with a team of doctors in materials from a well-known university to jointly develop and innovatively introduce aerospace and advanced military grade material - the best combination of carbon and aramid fibers.  After thousands of experiments, the world's first aramid fiber composite bicycle was created.",
      "Aramid Fiber is usually known as \u201cKevlar\u201d and is used to create body armors, bullet-proof vests, firefighters uniforms, and a world of other critical equipment that spells safety and strength for those who wear it.  Aramid Fiber is used for its excellent strength-to-weight ratio and heat-resistant properties, offering a shield of protection that is nevertheless lean and lightweight, that makes our unique e-bike exactly that: truly unique!",
      "Along with its Aramid Fiber build for extra strength and durability, the 3V Aramid Fiber Electric Bicycle has also been designed for enhanced frame impact resistance and with extra sitting tube toughness, having been repeatedly tested to reliably offer the kind of safety you want to enjoy.",
      "Safety is critical, comfort is essential. That\u2019s why your 3V Aramid Fiber Electric Bicycle has a seat tube built with aramid fiber and fork air suspension to provide effective shock absorption and overall improve your riding comfort. After all, especially when you\u2019re going offroad, no matter how daring your riding adventures may be, you still want to feel comfortable!",

      "The battery is obviously the heart of an electric bicycle\u2014which is why we equipped it with a powerful and convenient LG removable 36V battery with a 20Ah cell capacity, offering you a 4 hours battery life and 100km range that you can rely on\u2014with a battery lock function.",
      "This is an e-bike that doesn\u2019t set any limits\u2014on the contrary, it empowers your riding freedom! Featuring the original Japan-made Shimano ten-speed variable speed system, go fast or slow on your own terms!",
      "So what about the tires? Well, whether you want to ride your 3V in the mountains, on the beach, on snowy surfaces, in the city, or anywhere, really, this e-bike is equipped with true all-terrain multi-surface tires that got your back wherever you want to go!",
      "The best e-bike calls for the best brake system, right? You\u2019ll like to know that the 3V Aramid Fiber Electric Bicycle is equipped with the original Shimano front and rear double disc brakes. Yes, we double down on the unique quality of Shimano equipment, this time to ensure the brake system is stellarly safe and reliable!",
      "There\u2019s a good reason why an e-bike has a complex wiring layout\u2014because it\u2019s an electric bike, after all! However, that doesn\u2019t mean it needs to be all exposed, looking funky and poorly designed. With the 3V Aramid Fiber Electric Bicycle, you\u2019re in for an elegant ride. The wiring layout is hidden, discretely fulfilling its mission, so that you can only see the beauty of this very fine e-bike!",
      "Ride your bike while knowing where you stand with the 3V\u2019s code meter display screen, providing constantly updated data monitoring of your speed, mileage, power, and other metrics. Don\u2019t guess, don\u2019t worry about uncertainty\u2014this display screen always keeps you in the loop! In addition, the display screen is water-proof.",
      "Riding your bike is a rich experience of fun, adventure, comfort, mobility, and thrill. For bike riders, a ride is so much more than going from point A to point Z. We know that, which is why we made ergonomically designed leather-based handlebars: exceedingly comfortable, charismatically stylish!",

      "Snoring is annoying? Many anti-snoring products have no effect?",
      "Alisleep anti-snoring pillow can effectively stop snoring on the basis of understanding the principle of snoring.",
      "I know that many people suffer from snoring, but do you know why you snore?",
      "It\u2019s easy to understand. When you sleep, the musculature in your throat relaxes and your airway narrows. If your airway is too narrow, the airflow through your airway when you breathe in can cause the musculature in the airway to vibrate and make a sound. This is why you snore.",
      "When our anti-snore pillow detects snoring, the four built-in airbags will inflate according to the position of your head. This is to move your head to a suitable position to expand the musculature of the throat, which can let the airflow pass through the airway smoothly. So this is a very effective way to stop snoring.",
      "To ensure that the intervention works no matter where the snorer's head is on the pillow, we placed 4 full-sized individual airbags from side to side. No more blind spots for our anti-snoring system!",
      "Most of the anti-snore pillow doesn't have massage mode. But AliSleep has!",
      "AliSleep has set up a 30-minute massage method to relax the neck and shoulder muscles. By combining the frequency and strength of the four airbags with different inflation and deflation, AliSleep can achieve the relaxation effect before you go to bed.",
      "AliSleep adopts an integrated structure, abandoning the complicated external remote control. One key to completing all operations.",
      "The estimated shipping time is in April. The goods are all delivered by air or other means. And after the campaign ends, you will receive a PledgeBox email (and multiple follow-ups if needed) to select your final order choices and pay the shipping costs.

      "A Camera Trigger packed with High-Speed, Wireless Flash Control, Timelapse, HDR, AI Suggestion, more",
      "Hey Indiegogo!",
      "We are LUMIONIX, thrilled to announce our first campaign KOMET, we believe the most advanced camera trigger yet designed by a team of creative engineers who are passionate about photography.",
      "Never miss the perfect shot. Whether you're shooting High-Speed, Timelapse, HDR, or Long-Exposure, KOMET allows you to achieve your creative vision.",
      "No matter, photography is your full-time job or you just bought your very first camera, KOMET takes your storytelling above and beyond.",
      "We hope you'll love it as much as we do. Enjoy discovering!",
      "KOMET is an extraordinary photography tool, jam-packed with awesome features to enhance your creativity. It mounts straight into your camera\u2019s hot-shoe and utilizes USB port to unleash various possibilities. Easily access all intuitive features from its on-board touchscreen app or the mobile app.",
      "In the past, the Crowdfunding community has seen various camera triggers and related products. We acknowledge and respect these products. As a result, we conducted in-depth research to discover ways to advance camera triggers to the next level, and the idea for KOMET was born.",
      "We analyzed the features provided by typical camera triggers and added numerous extras to help photographers elevate their storytelling.",
      "We understand the inconvenience and expense of purchasing different devices from different vendors. To solve this problem, KOMET is designed to provide photography hobbyists and professionals with the maximum features they desire.",
      "Capturing the perfect moment can be tricky, but KOMET makes it easy with advanced sensor technology that triggers the shutter at the right time. The sensitive sensor allows you to adjust the threshold limit and capture the exact moment you are looking for.",
      "Light is always critical for photography, especially when shooting indoors calls for external light. Unlike other High-Speed triggers, we've harnessed the potential of the hot shoe and created a Wireless Flash Receiver add-on.",
      "Timelapse is our favorite genre of photography hence We devoted meticulous attention to developing this feature. With KOMET, you can master everything from the basics to complex holy-grail timelapse.",
      "We created a deep neural network with a vast dataset of thousands of professional images, and we invite you to contribute your photos to our community and scale them without any limit.",
      "We will release this feature as a beta version upon delivering the rewards, as we are still in the process of collecting images to create our AI Machine Learning dataset. We are actively seeking photographers to join us as contributors. If you believe this feature can assist beginners and are interested, please feel free to sign up as a contributor in this Google Forms.",
      "Taking great photos often requires being in the right place at the right time, but creating images with extra drama requires tools and techniques. Long-exposure photography with ND filters may seem daunting with charts and stop calculators, but with KOMET App, you can forget all of that. Our app offers a built-in ND calculator. Simply tap to choose your desired ND stop and update your camera exposure automatically.",
      "The KOMET app is professionally designed and user-friendly, gives you access to all the essential camera settings. It is available for both iOS and Android platforms.",
      "Safely backing up your content is always vital in the overall workflow. KOMET provides a convenient way to backup your content, even if your laptop runs out of juice. Simply insert your camera's memory card and connect your portable hard drive to transfer files instantly.",
      "Additionally, our app offers file management services that allow you to organize your content from anywhere.",

      "In our entire development process, compatibility has been the most significant challenge. KOMET employs USB communication instead of a simple Shutter Release port, which can lead to USB protocol compatibility issues with various camera brands and models. Our dedicated team has worked diligently to ensure KOMET supports a wide range of DSLR and Mirrorless cameras, including Canon, Nikon, and popular Sony Alpha models. Please refer to the compatibility list below for details, and rest assured, we are continuously striving to include more models.",
      "You may notice that a few models in the list are marked as 'grayed out - In the Pipeline,' indicating they are currently in the testing phase. We are actively working on bringing them onboard soon. If your camera falls within this category, you can still back our campaign, and we encourage you to report your model here in this Google Forms. Our team will keep you informed about its testing progress and notify you once it gets passed.",
      "Fujifilm: Though we are considering a limited selection, due to popular demand, it is among our top priorities for future compatibility.",
      "Olympus, Panasonic, and Pentax: We extend our sincere apologies for the limited support. Rest assured, we are actively working to expand the list to include more models.",
      "If your camera model falls under our target brands, which include Canon, Nikon, Sony, Fuji, Olympus, and Panasonic, but is not listed, please vote for your camera model in this Google Forms or send us an email at hello@lumionix.com. We will investigate the possibilities and promptly respond to your inquiry.",
      "There are numerous reputable brands in the market offering similar camera trigger products, all with the shared aim of assisting creators in realizing their creative visions. Lumionix is excited to join this journey by introducing KOMET.",
      "We'd like to acknowledge a few Kickstarter-born brands that have made remarkable contributions to the industry. MIOPS, an industry leader in high-speed photography, continues to impress. Arsenal astonishingly incorporates AI into photography, serving as a significant source of inspiration for us. Unleashed by the Foolography team has amazed us with their incredibly compact device form factor.",
      "We hold deep respect for all these brands and aim to provide you with a parallel features comparison, not to claim superiority over any of them, but to assist you in selecting the right tool for your creative needs.",
      "Please note that we have not personally used these devices and have gathered information from their respective websites. If we have overlooked any significant features of another brand, we sincerely apologize and encourage you to inform us so that we can update our information accordingly.",
      "We have taken a meticulous approach to designing KOMET, with a focus on considering every technical detail with the user experience in mind. We believe that this emphasis on technical excellence will enhance your photography journey.",
      "The journey of creating the KOMET Camera trigger has been a true labor of love, spanning almost three years, even amidst the challenges posed by the COVID-19 period. We want to give you a sneak peek into the different steps we took to make it happen: first, we drew out our ideas, then we designed all the electronics that make it work, and we used computer-aided design to make sure it looked and functioned just right. Finally, we built and tested prototypes, ensuring it's ready for your use. The KOMET Camera trigger isn't just a product to us; it's the result of years of hard work and dedication to making something great. We love it and hope you will too.",
      "*EU VAT Note: Please note that EU VAT, typically around 21%, will be applied based on the regulations of each country. In our Pledge Manager survey, we will provide you with the option of DDP (Delivered Duty Paid). If you choose not to manage the customs VAT and prefer us to handle it, we will include the VAT value along with the shipping fee.",
      "At LUMIONIX, our passion for photography and technology fuels our commitment to developing innovative tools that can help photographers push their creative boundaries. We are dedicated to gaining a deep understanding of users' needs, which is why we developed KOMET, our first product. Our mission is to provide photographers with cutting-edge devices that can improve their workflow, increase their productivity, and expand their artistic possibilities. With KOMET, we've created a camera Trigger that combines advanced features, intuitive design, and reliable performance, enabling photographers to capture their vision with ease and precision.",
      "With the mission of \"Ignite your creative light,\" we strive to develop adaptable camera accessories that empower photographers to take their photography above and beyond. Join us on our journey to bring KOMET to life!",
      "Hi, I'm Nazmus an Electronics Engineer, amateur timelapse photographer, and the creator of LUMIONIX KOMET. The idea for KOMET came to me when I developed an exposure ramper device for my personal timelapse photography. As I continued to explore, I realized that KOMET had the potential to integrate features beyond the timelapse arena, such as high-speed photography, wireless flash triggers, and more. I saw the opportunity to develop a camera trigger that could meet the needs of photographers looking to push their creative limits.",
      "Developing KOMET is a significant collaborative effort by a talented team. As an Electronics Engineer, I dedicated my full-time attention for over two years closely with skilled Mechanical Engineers and Software Developers. After an extensive development process, KOMET is now ready for production, and we are thrilled to unveil our creation to the Indiegogo community.",

      "Ever since our backers and us started using Capsule, we learned from their feedback and our own experience that having clean dishes at the press of a button brings other important side benefits. It motivates people to eat at home more often, to cook and feel less stressed about it, to have a healthier lifestyle, and to enjoy meals with family and friends.",
      "Today, we are incredibly excited to continue on this journey and to expand our goals. Our vision is creating positive communities, fostering a positive work environment, creating more opportunities for women to advance their careers and raising awareness about mental health. Our mission is to build a brand that offers the best solutions for a sustainable lifestyle so we can save more lochs (lakes) together.",

      "The seat is tilted at a 120\u00b0 angle (instead of the usual flat 90\u00b0 your probs used to) which pushes your hips forward. This allows you to maintain an upright seated posture, keep your core engaged, and take tremendous pressure off your lower back.",

However, the modern concept of kneeling chairs as we know them today began to take shape in the late 20th century. By the turn of the millennium, when the patents from the 70ies expired, kneeling chairs became more widespread, offering individuals an alternative seating option to promote better posture and reduce back strain.",

    "company_name": "Alain & Jordi from pOrtahl",
    "allParagraphs": [
      "Each watch has its own unique zen garden inspired dial pattern, created using 18th-century math",
      "Your new Zenmaster watch is one-of-a-kind. How? Based on an 18th-century concept called 'Truchet tiles', a mathematical algorithm creates a one-of-one Japanese zen garden inspired dial pattern for every Zenmaster watch we make. Your dial pattern is as uniquely yours as your fingerprint. No two watches are ever the same.",
      "Here's the complete TL;DR on why pOrtahl's Zenmaster is the next watch you are missing:",
      "ONLY during our crowdfunding campaign do you have the chance to obtain a Zenmaster with a special Founders Edition inscription on the dial. Founders Edition Zenmasters are limited to the number of backers who pre-order during our crowdfunding campaign.",
      "At pOrtahl\u00ae we create watches you are missing. We honor classic watch design while speaking a bold, modern design language\u2014and most importantly, without the sky-high price tag. Welcome to our next Indiegogo project!",
      "// All product imagery shown on our Indiegogo page was photographed using real physical prototypes of the Zenmaster watch. No AI-generated visuals or 3D renders were used. What you see is exactly what we built.",
      "In 2020, we, Jordi van Staveren (left) and Alain van den Donk (right), founded pOrtahl\u00ae with a mission: to reimagine classic watchmaking for today\u2019s world.\n\nFrustrated by the endless copies of legendary designs flooding the market, we set out to create watches that honor classic watch design while speaking a bold, new, modern design language\u2014and most importantly, without the sky-high price tag.\n\nIn 2022 we successfully launched our Peacemaker watch on Kickstarter + Indiegogo, raising over $120,000, funding us 5 times over, and as promised; delivering all Founders Edition watches to our backers. This proved our vision resonated.\n\nNow, we are writing the next chapter of pOrtahl\u00ae with Zenmaster. Join us on this adventure!",
      "Our brand name, pOrtahl\u00ae, is derived from the word \u201cportal.\u201d A gateway into another dimension. Instead of feeling stressed out, we want each little timetelling occasion to offer a brief escape from the hustle and bustle of daily life.",
      "The Zenmaster, inspired by Japanese zen gardens (\u67af\u5c71\u6c34, karesansui), embodies this philosophy. Zen gardens are designed for meditation and symbolize balance, simplicity, and peace\u2014offering a moment of calm in the midst of chaos.",
      "Subtle elements of Japanese culture and Zen Buddhism are carefully woven into the watch, inviting quiet reflection with every glance. You will find these little nods and references throughout the design, helping you tell a story about your watch to an enquiring stranger.",
      "One of the main features that sets the Zenmaster apart is its dial. Each one features a unique pattern, etched with ultimate precision to evoke the tranquillity of the carefully raked lines in a zen garden. No two watches are ever the same.",
      "WatchChris (170k subscribers)",
      "Design Atelier (27k subscribers)",
      "Our goal for the Zenmaster was to design an entry-level automatic watch, without compromising anything on quality or design. The Zenmaster had to emanate a sense of quiet luxury, while still being suited for everyday wear.",
      "We did our own sourcing, meeting with manufacturing and assembly partners in Switzerland, Hong Kong, China and the Netherlands. We have since created multiple prototypes that we have peer-reviewed, and real-world tested ourselves. We now present to you, Zenmaster. The culmination of months of research, designing, and testing.",
      "We firmly believe this is the next watch you are missing: 'The watch as unique as your fingerprint'.",
      "Let's dive into all the features we incorporated on the Zenmaster watch.",
      "Zenmaster's steel dial is one of the main attractions of this watch. Each and every Zenmaster dial is etched with its own unique pattern, reflecting the lines raked in the sand of a Japanese zen garden to evoke a sense of calm and balance.",
      "The zen patterns are created using a mathematical algorithm that is based on Truchet\u2019s 18th-century tiling concept. The result is that no two dials are ever the same, making your dial as uniquely yours as your own fingerprint.",
      "The concept of Truchet-tiles was first conceived by S\u00e9bastien Truchet, an 18th-century French mathematician and inventor. He introduced the idea of using repeating square tiles with fixed patterns that could be rotated individually to create highly intricate designs.",
      "Today, Truchet tiles are used in algorithmic design to create visually captivating and unique patterns, such as the ones found on the Zenmaster\u2019s dial.",
      "Our mathematical algorithm, based on this concept, dictates which tiles to turn and ensures that the pattern we create has never been created before, and will never be created again.",
      "The dial pattern can seem strong in photos, but in reality the lines disappear and reappear depending on how the light refracts on the dial, shifting between modest and outspoken.",
      "At pOrtahl\u00ae we love a sleek design. Our Zenmaster has a case size of 40.5 mm, and an incredibly slim case height of only 10.2 mm\u2014that's including crystal, no cheating\u2014 allowing it to slide effortlessly through any shirt sleeve.",
      "The case of the Zenmaster is crafted from highly durable coated 316L surgical grade stainless steel, with a sandblasted matte silver finish, a brushed finish along the sides, complemented by carefully polished details to communicate a sense of quiet luxury.",
      "At the heart of the design are our \u201chugger lugs\", which gracefully embrace the sides of the case. The lugs are inspired by the concept of Yin and Yang, with one lug bending slightly upward and the other down to symbolize balance.",
      "We incorporated a custom designed fluted bezel, in a sandblasted matte silver finish to perfectly blend in with the case, while adding texture. Inside of the case on the chapter ring, you'll find our Japanese lotus petal shaped markers on the 3, 6, 9 and 12 positions.",
      "Just like the case, the bracelet is made from IPH-coated surgical grade stainless steel (316L), it features a sandblasted finish with polished accents, echoing the case\u2019s contrast of textures.",
      "The bracelet is designed to have a fully integrated look, with a sleek butterfly clasp and a cleverly concealed connection to the case. In reality, the bracelet is easily interchangeable thanks to double quick-release pins.",
      "The concealed connection allows for personalization with any straight-ended 22 mm strap or bracelet, to create your own style, while still maintaining an integrated aesthetic. Check out how our Premium FKM rubber straps look on Zenmaster's case as an example!",
      "Each changeable link is secured with screw pins, a feature requested by our Facebook community of over 3,000 members. Screw pins allow for easy adjustment with the included tools. We're also throwing in 2 half links, for a perfect fit on every wrist.",
      "That means no visit to your local watch shop required for a size adjustment, you can easily size your newly unboxed Zenmaster yourself!",
      "Want to switch the bracelet out for one of our FKM Rubber straps, available in various colors that all look incredible on Zenmaster? See 'Add-ons' for more information.",
      "Why do you need a coating? You might be familiar with that dreaded moment when you look down at your favorite watch, and it has become marred with scratches, smudges, and signs of wear.",
      "Yeah, we hate that. One of our core design principles is to make watches that last lifetimes. That's why we always protect our watches with scratch-resistant coatings.",
      "It is extremely important for us that Zenmaster can be worn daily, but the thing is, a daily watch needs to endure A LOT. That's why we want Zenmaster to be able to take a beating, yet stay as pristine as the day you first unboxed it. So, we went searching for a coating that can do just that, and we found it.",
      "The Zenmaster\u2019s case, bezel, and bracelet are shielded by an A-grade Ion Plating Hardened (IPH) coating that ensures premium resilience against everyday wear and tear. With a hardness of 1,500 HV, our A-grade coating protects against scratches, fingerprints, and sweat, preserving the watch\u2019s clean matte finish.",
      "For reference, uncoated stainless steel has a hardness of only 200 HV, which means our coating increases the hardness of the stainless steel by 7.50x (!). While it doesn't mean it's indestructible, it does significantly increase Zenmaster's resistance to scratches.",
      "That way you can stay zen and maintain a scratch- and smudge-free appearance. Stay zen my friend.",
      "For the Zenmaster, we chose a tried-and-true Japanese automatic - the MIYOTA 9015 movement. The Cal. 9015 was first introduced in 2009 and is part of MIYOTA's Premium line of automatic movements.",
      "The MIYOTA 9015 is trusted by top-tier microbrands worldwide. This movement combines outstanding performance with a sleek profile, allowing the Zenmaster's case to be as slim as it is (10.2 mm including glass), while also housing a highly dependable movement with over 15 years of track record. The Cal. 9015 is well-known for its longevity, precision, and reliability.",
      "Zenmaster\u2019s rotor complements the zen garden pattern of the dial, providing a beautiful contrast to the movement, which is visible through the exhibition caseback. It is finished in rose gold IP to match the crown, indices, and hands.",
      "The Cal. 9015 gives the Zenmaster a clean sweep (8 beats per second) and offers a generous 42-hour power reserve, allowing you to take the watch off on the weekend for a quiet \"Zen Day\".",
      "The Zenmaster features sapphire crystal on both the front and the open caseback, chosen for its best-in-class clarity and durability. Ranking just below diamond on the Mohs hardness scale, sapphire crystal offers exceptional scratch resistance.",
      "Our sapphire crystal is treated with an anti-reflective coating, offering a glare-free view of your one-of-a-kind zen dial and the MIYOTA-movement from every angle.",
      "Our rose gold crown is a screw-down, a feature that was highly requested by our private community of 3,000+ members on Facebook. It features the pOrtahl\u00ae ring engraving on the side.",
      "After unscrewing the crown, it can be pulled out into three different positions; manual winding position, date-setting position and the time-setting position.",
      "The watch hands come in a rose gold IP-finish that adds warmth and sophistication to the dial, contrasting beautifully with the cool matte tones of the case.",
      "The hour and minute hands feature a classic dauphine style, a shape that originated in the mid-20th century. Its inception and increasing popularity is often credited to Patek Philippe.",
      "The seconds hand features pOrtahl\u2019s signature ring-shaped counterweight, finished with a matte silver tip.",
      "pOrtahl\u00ae offers a 2-year international warranty on our Zenmaster watch, meaning we will repair or replace your Zenmaster watch within 2 years of delivery if it suffers from any mechanical, manufacturing, or assembly defects. This warranty does not cover damages resulting from misuse, or any cosmetic damage such as scratches or marks to the finish, which under the conditions of the warranty constitute regular wear and tear. Opening the caseback outside of an authorized repair will render the warranty null and void. In the unlikely event that your Zenmaster suffers from a mechanical defect, please contact us immediately, and we will offer you a fitting solution.",
      "Further customize your Zenmaster look with a variety of FKM rubber straps. FKM rubber is highly resistant to wear and tear, which is why it's often used in the aerospace and automotive industries.",
      "You'll notice when you pick your straps up out of the box that they're unexpectedly weighty. That's because of the super high density of FKM rubber. It's the highest quality rubber you can find.",
      "You can now pick your favorite color(s) and add them to your rewards during checkout! All straps pre-ordered during our crowdfunding campaign are 41% OFF RETAIL.",
      "Just like Peacemaker, we have designed Zenmaster fully in-house. In this chapter we want to share our vision on watch design with you.",
      "At pOrtahl\u00ae we have 5 design goals that make up our design ethos for any watch that we are ever going to create.",
      "1. Your daily choice - our watches are designed for daily wear, making them tempting to put on every single morning.",
      "2. Conversation pieces - our watches are conversation starters, designed to help you tell a story.",
      "3. Lasting lifetimes -  our watches are engineered to last and to be passed on from generation to generation.",
      "4. Designed with you in mind - our watches are designed for the wearer, eliminating common frustrations and ensuring the best possible experience.",
      "5. Make every time-telling occasion special - our watches are not just objects, they invoke emotional connections.",
      "Note that the watch in the photos is a prototype and that we are still looking to make a number of improvements on the production version that will be shipped out to backers. Let\u2019s go over what we still want to improve and what you can expect from the Zenmaster watch you will receive when we get successfully funded.",
      "With these improvements, we are confident that we will be able to provide all of our backers and future customers with a high quality watch that lives up to our standards and your expectations. We are extremely excited for you to have the final version in-hand and on-wrist. With your help we can make that happen!",
      "At pOrtahl\u00ae we are obsessed with our promise to deliver.",
      "During our last crowdfunding campaign for Peacemaker, we gave backers zero customization options. The reason was that our research showed many projects failed to deliver due to the logistics and manufacturing complexities that customization brings. After all, every variant that was ordered has to be manufactured according to order and shipped out to the right person, even if it was only one.",
      "At the same time, one of our main points of feedback on our last crowdfuning campaign was the absence of customization options. To accommodate the wish for backers to make rewards their own through customization, we went looking for a way to make that possible without shooting ourselves in the foot.",
      "Especially with the success of our last campaign, we feel more comfortable this time to experiment with customization. That's why backers can now customize their Zenmaster look with FKM rubber straps in a variety of colors. Your selected FKM rubber strap(s) can be ordered as add-ons during checkout and will ship out with your order.",
      "Just like last time; we aim to deliver your watch on time, to your doorstep, as promised.",
      "My name is Alain (on the right) and I co-founded pOrtahl\u00ae  together with Jordi (on the left). We met when Jordi became my supervisor, back when I was doing an internship at a marketing agency in 2015. We became best friends over our shared love for product design and we started working together shortly after finishing my internship. We have been talking about creating a watch together ever since we met, but we finally started working on it in 2020.",
      "In 2021 we launched our first watch, called Peacemaker, on Kickstarter and Indiegogo. It was a bigger success than we had ever imagined. 222 backers helped make our dream come true, helping us raise over $120,000 and manufacturing our first watch.",
      "We\u2019re back with our next watch: Zenmaster. It\u2019s inspired by Japanese Zen gardens, where the patterns raked in the gravel are an invitation to pause, breathe and reflect. A place for meditation and quiet reflection. That idea really stuck with us. We wanted to bring that same feeling into a watch.",
      "With Zenmaster, our goal was to build an entry-level automatic. Something accessible, but without cutting corners. It had to feel special, one-of-a-kind. Sleek enough to dress up, tough enough for daily wear. Quiet luxury that doesn\u2019t scream for attention. To us, the Zenmaster watch serves as a base for the collection that follows.",
      "And of course, it ties into what pOrtahl\u00ae  has always stood for. The deeper meaning behind our brand name is about turning that stress you often feel when checking the time into a tiny escape from the hustle and bustle of daily life, even just for a second. Allowing your mind to go through a portal into something a feeling of calm.",
      "If you're curious to see more watches like this\u2014we\u2019d love your support. Back our campaign, join the journey, and help us bring this unique watch into existence!",
      "Thank you so much for being here. Let\u2019s build Zenmaster together.",
      "Hopefully yours,",
