Our 20+ years of experience across these key areas have gone into creating OLLIS and The Foundry Pan.",
      "Head of the table: is our creative lead, Emily. She is a food author, stylist, art director, and trained chef. She\u2019s worked with the biggest names in the food industry, creating cookbooks and trends that have helped shape the food industry.",
      "Serving up:  Alex turns ideas into reality. He runs a London-based Industrial Design studio and his successful career has seen him design everything from quantum computers and smart TV's, to now, Cast Iron Cookware.",
      "Spinning the plates: With 20-years in media and production, Seb is the one keeping everything on track. With a hand in every part of the process, he ensures things stay at a steady simmer and never boils over.",
      "Our unique collective skills meant we could concept, design, prototype and test, all in-house. Over 18 months, we refined every aspect of The Foundry Pan - from reducing wall thicknesses for weight while maintaining key cooking qualities, to testing handle designs for comfort and safety. The result is a contemporary yet timeless look that stands out from the rest in any kitchen.",
      "Food at the heart: With food at the core of everything we do, we ensure every decision is driven by cooking performance and food presentation. Our connections in the food industry allowed both home cooks and professionals to test every aspect of our design.",
      "OLLIS: is formed from 20-years of food industry knowledge, trend setting and passion. We'll be sharing this knowledge in our recipe ideas that you'll receive with the pan and through our regular newsletters - so be sure to sign up!",
      "We\u2019ve been hard at work long before this campaign. Our manufacturers are ready, and once we hit our funding goal, we\u2019ll start production. We\u2019ll keep you updated every step of the way with a clear timeline.",
      "By backing us, you\u2019re investing in affordable, sustainable, toxin-free cookware. Good for the planet, your cooking, and the people you\u2019ll share it with.",
      "We\u2019re committed to keeping shipping costs and delivery times as low as possible while prioritising greener transportation to reduce our carbon footprint.",
      "Our plan is to ship all products from our manufacturer to trusted fulfillment centers in the EU, US and UK, ensuring faster and more efficient delivery. By stocking warehouses closer to our backers, the final \u2018last-mile delivery\u2019 - the part you pay for - will be as short and affordable as possible.",
      "While sea freight takes longer than air, it is the most sustainable and cost-effective option. These costs, along with local import charges, are factored into our pricing.",
      "We believe in transparency and communication, keeping you updated at every stage, from production to delivery, including tracking numbers once your order ships. However, as a small business, we\u2019re not Amazon - so while we work hard to deliver on time, things may take a little longer.",
      "Thankfully we chose a trusted manufacturing partner in China not only for their commitment to sustainability and quality, but also because they operate additional facilities across Asia, which offer the same high standards.",
      "We\u2019re prepared to absorb tariffs where necessary - just as we will in Europe and the UK, this is usual business. The current situation with China is unprecedented and has created real challenges, particularly for small, independent brands like ours.",
      "That said, we feel fortunate to have made a decision early on that gives us options. We\u2019re doing everything we can to navigate this responsibly, and most importantly, making sure to shield our backers from any impact.",
      "Cast iron is built to last, but it\u2019s also heavy, which means higher shipping costs. We\u2019ve optimised packaging to keep it as compact as possible, and as our order volume increases, per-unit shipping costs will decrease.",
      "Shipping will be charged after the campaign, but here\u2019s an estimate for a single Foundry Pan:",
      "US \u2013 $20\u2013$25 USD\nUK \u2013 \u00a315-\u00a320 GBP\nEU \u2013 \u20ac20\u2013\u20ac25 EUR",

      "Better coffee is all in the beans. And the right grinder can unlock flavors you never knew were there. Most home grinders only offer limited control over your grind level, speed, and burr choice, and leaving half the flavor still trapped in your beans \u2013 or leaving old grounds stuck in the burrs and spouts through retention.",
      "It's time for a change, and that's why we've introduced the Gevi Grandmaster.",
      "Limitless Customization, Your Coffee, Your Way",
      "Stepless grinding lets you play with precise adjustments and endless combinations of fine or coarse grinds. Wider RPM adjustment delves the most intricate flavor out of beans. It works flawlessly with a world of 64mm flat burrs (also supports SSP burrs!), making it perfectly caters to your needs.",
      "Such adjustments require top-tier grinding power.",
      "An onboard pre-breaker taps deeper flavors from every bean, unleashing the full potential of the burrs. The powerful 400W BLDC motor ensures smooth and consistent grind. 64mm commercial-level flat burrs ensure consistent grinding quality and preserve the original flavors.",
      "Whether compared to coffee grinders in the $500, $1000, or even $1500 price range, our machine holds its own without compromise. It excels in motor performance, even surpassing many higher-priced alternatives. High-end features such as plasma generator and prebreaker, which are typically found on grinders priced over $1,000, are now available from GrindMaster at a price lower than $500.",
      "Over the past weeks we invited early supporters who subscribed to GrindMaster campaign to join Beta Tester program and provide us with authentic feedback on the stepless version. Their comments and reviews have been extraordinary. As more feedback is submitted, this section will be updated.",
      "Here are videos from Zach on making espresso, AeroPress and pour-over with GrindMaster:",
      "We invited YouTube creators in the coffee industry to test GrindMaster, and they all praised its coffee grinding capabilities. Just search \"Gevi GrindMaster\" on YouTube and you can find many amazing reviews! We have more reviews coming up, please stay tuned.",
      "The renowned YouTuber, Lifestyle Lab, who previously tested the initial version of our GrindMaster, has now conducted a review of our latest version as well. In his video, he mentioned, \"...this grinder has always been competitive with a good burr set, RPM control, active anti-static and a pretty striking design.\" Please click on the video below to learn more about the upgrades and his assessment of these improvements.",
      "Another reputable reviewer, Our Coffee Shelter, has conducted rigorous trials including grinding light roast beans, marker tests for burr alignment, dial setting experiments for espresso extraction, and an SSP burr swap, and the results were outstanding!",
      "Watch the captivating video review by Our Coffee Shelter for an in-depth analysis and to witness the latest upgraded GrindMaster in action!",
      "Stepped grinders limit your imagination and keep you tied to a handful of fixed grind settings, unable to grind for espresso that requires high-level of precise control in grinding size. But Gevi GrindMaster lets you dial in on your ideal grind size with its stepless settings.",
      "Whether you need fine grinds to max out taste in an espresso, or a coarse grind to bring full-bodied flavor to a French press, you\u2019ll get greater precision and the freedom to unlock the flavors that hide between settings.",
      "To meet the high demands of espresso grinding, we have upgraded the thread pitch to 0.5mm, reducing the burr gap between each step to 5\u00b5m. This gap is 50% shorter than other high-end, stepless grinders priced over $1200. A shorter burr gap results in a broader range for espresso grinding, offering users more precise control over particle size.",
      "It\u2019s incredible \u2013 how the same beans tell a different story just by changing your grind speed. Lower speeds maintain more of their delicate flavor. Meanwhile, hitting your beans at high speed can release deeper aromas and unlock a bolder taste.",
      "That\u2019s why GrindMaster gives you 11 different grinding speeds \u2013 a breakthrough for home coffee grinders. This allows you to explore your own extraction techniques to get different flavor profiles.",
      "Let's take a closer look at Gevi Orion burr first:",
      "Whether you prefer the precision of pour-over or the rich intensity of espresso, the dual-purpose Orion burrs deliver excellent performance on every cup. It features titanium and obsidian coating that reduces the heat generated during grinding and preserves the original flavors.",
      "Some youtubers also reviewed this burr and gave it a very high rating.",
      "The Gevi Grindmaster features a powerful 400W BLDC (Brushless Direct Current) motor. that offers unparalleled 5N\u00b7m torque. It it 2 times more powerful than other grinders and can grind ultra-hard lightly roasted beans with low RPM smoothly.",
      "GrindMaster\u2019s built-in pre-breaker works by cracking your beans before they enter the grinding chamber, giving your burrs a larger canvas to grind so they can scrape out deeper layers of flavor from every bean.",
      "That gives you more consistent grinds and even flavors, while enhancing the power of your burrs.",
      "GrindMaster is made for both home and commercial use, with the robust performance to keep up with non-stop cafe orders, and the simplicity to suit a Sunday morning espresso in your bath robe.",
      "The GrindMaster features a dual-step anti-retention structure. The first step is the vertical burrs and spout design, allowing coffee grounds to be completely pushed out of the grinding chamber , minimizing residue.",
      "The second step is the plasma anti-static technology, preventing grounds from accumulating around the spout, allowing them to fall vertically without clumping. This eliminates the hassle of manual \"knocking\" or \"RDT\", making the whole grinding process smoother.",
      "GrindMaster is made for those who like to be hands on. Unlike most grinders, it features a chamber that\u2019s easy to take apart tool free, so you can clean it by hand any time and keep it running in tip-top condition.",
      "The magnetic design of the dosing cup and scale make them a team that\u2019s easy to keep together. The digital scale weighs coffee beans, grounds, and your pours with precision so every cup tastes right. The cup rims work well with various portafilters, making it easy to work with when you\u2019re crafting an espresso.",
      "Coffee grinders aren\u2019t known for their quiet grace. But we designed GrindMaster to keep a low profile even at high speeds. That\u2019s all thanks to its brushless motor keeping decibels down even while RPMs ramp up.",
      "Inspired by the Greek columns of the Parthenon, GrindMaster is as much a decorative piece as a grinding powerhouse. Its timeless metal cantilever design and golden ratio structure bring style to any cafe, while earning it a place on the most modern kitchen counters.",
      "GrindMaster\u2019s bean hopper is specially designed to give you better control of your bean flow, preventing bean jumping during pours and keeping every grind under control.",
      "When it comes to buttons, less is more. We combined the GrindMaster\u2019s Power and Speed controls into one dial, making it effortlessly simple to use. Because the only press you should be focused on is the French kind.",
      "Here is the specification table for our product, which includes key technical specifications and performance indicators. Please refer to the table below for more detailed information.",
      "Gevi GrindMaster is available in two color options, Deep Gray Gold and Frost Silver. After selecting the perk, there is a color option",
      "Gevi GrindMaster provides users with 2 types of perks. If you don't know how to choose, you can refer to the following instructions.",
      "-Gevi Orion Burr is a multifunctional burr designed by Gevi. It works well with a wide range of coffee styles, including Espresso, Pour-over and French press. If you enjoy a wide variety of coffee types, while also valuing the cost-effectiveness of the burrs, we recommend choosing the Gevi Orion Burr.",
      "We also offer users the Dosing Cup with Digital Scale, which can make the grinding process smoother and eliminate the need for separate weighing of the coffee grounds. The price difference between the Dosing Cup with Digital Scale and the one without is $50.",

The shipping fee for the United Kingdom is $70. Backers from other countries and regions will see the specific shipping fee after entering their shipping address.",
      "Due to the size of the product, and after providing a significant discount to our users, it is challenging for us to cover the entire shipping cost. However, we have already covered a significant portion of the shipping fee for our global backers.",
      "We will match the plug and corresponding voltage based on the shipping country selected when you choose the perk. Please check the FAQ for more detailed information.",
      "Gevi is a company with mature production capabilities.

      "Back in 2020, I met Raymond on a flight back to Hong Kong. We got to talking about our love for hammocks, and we couldn't help but notice how outdated hammock stands were. I mean, in a world with all this crazy tech, why were hammock stands stuck in the dark ages? So the moment we landed, we decided to team up and fix this problem. And that's how anymaka was born.",
      "The word, \u201chammock\u201d comes from the Spanish word, \u201chamaca\u201d, which, in turn, comes from the Arawakan (Taino) root word, \u201c-maka\u201d meaning, \u201cstretch of cloth\u201d. We incorporated the word, \"anywhere\" into it and created the brand name, \u201cAnymaka\u201d which means, \u201ca stretch of cloth that can go anywhere\u201d. And that becomes our mission: to bring that chill hammock vibe to any spot you want to hang out.",
      "To make this happen, we quickly built an engineering team based in China and Hong Kong working closely with our manufacturers. Our intense two-year product development process was filled with prototyping, testing, and relentless redesigning. We were on a mission to make our hammock stand lighter, tougher, and a breeze to pack.",
      "This was our very first prototype. It couldn't even handle the weight of a little kid. In the coming months, we tried tweaking and refining it and went through multiple iterations.",
      "In the end, we had to ditch the entire initial design. It hit us hard as we had poured so much time and effort into it.",
      "Deciding to carry on, a second concept was built. With a more robust design, enhanced portability, and smoother operation, it became the foundation of our future improvements.",
      "We kept pushing forward, continuously refining and iterating upon this fundamentally solid design. We put it to the test, pushing its load-bearing capacity to the limits. Throughout this process, we also focused on perfecting our sunshade design, striving for the ultimate goal of being lightweight, using minimal fabric, ensuring maximum stability, making it easy to set up, and achieving the best possible sunshade effect.",

      "Help Us Create a Sustainable Tourism Hub in the Heart of the Pamir Mountains!",
      "I was born in the breathtaking Pamir Mountains of Tajikistan, where the town of Khorogh rests like a gem cradled by majestic peaks. From an early age, I was enchanted by the rugged beauty of the landscape, the vibrant tapestry of native legends, and the soulful rhythms of our traditional and ceremonial music. In 2007 I immigrated to the United States to formally study the art of filmmaking. Since then, I have returned to Khorogh and the broader Pamir region each year, driven by a passion for researching, documenting, and celebrating the often-overlooked traditions, lifestyle, and artistic expressions of my people.\nWith every return, I witnessed the growing presence of international travelers \u2014 wanderers drawn by the same untouched beauty and cultural richness of Khorogh. Conversations with these visitors revealed a shared longing: to preserve the pristine environment and to learn from the indigenous ways of living in harmony with nature. These heartfelt exchanges became the seeds of a vision \u2014 to create a space where culture, sustainability, and community could flourish.\nThus was born the idea of building glamping barns and an artisanal caf\u00e9 \u2014 a sanctuary where stories can be exchanged, traditions honored, and nature revered.",
      "Tucked away in the majestic Pamir Mountains of Tajikistan, Khorogh is a breathtaking gem, rich in natural beauty, vibrant culture, and warm-hearted people. Despite its immense potential to attract global travelers seeking authentic, off-the-beaten-path experiences, Khorog remains undiscovered mainly due to a lack of modern tourism infrastructure.",
      "We envision changing that\u2014sustainably and inclusively.",
      "Our project proposes the development of four beautifully designed glamping barns and an artisanal caf\u00e9, perched just above Khorogh with sweeping views of the valley, only a 5-minute walk from the town center. This initiative will offer a unique eco-friendly retreat for tourists while preserving the region's natural and cultural heritage.",
      "Each glamping barn will be fully equipped with a private kitchen, toilet, shower, and reliable Wi-Fi, blending comfort with rustic charm and environmental responsibility. The art caf\u00e9 will serve delicious traditional food and feature live performances of Pamiri music and dance, showcasing the region's artistic spirit.",
      "But this project is about more than tourism\u2014it's about community empowerment. By creating construction, hospitality, culinary arts, and performance jobs, we aim to provide meaningful employment for local residents, stimulate the local economy, and encourage the next generation to stay and thrive in their homeland.",

      "Revolutionary brain-computer interface: Lab-quality EEG Kit that makes advanced neurotech accessible",
      "The BROADMIND Research Kit is the world\u2019s first device to combine lab-quality neurotechnology with the accessibility of a consumer product and open-source software ecosystem support.",
      "We\u2019re at the forefront of neurotechnology and AI, and our non-surgical wearable brain-computer interface (BCI) allows users to access State-of-the-Art neuroscience achievements, like cognitive enhancement and controlling devices and applications, with their minds.",
      "Our mission is to bridge the gap between groundbreaking neuroscience and everyday life. We accelerate the transition of advanced neurotech from the lab to the public, empowering individuals with cutting-edge brain-computer interface (BCI) technologies.",
      "By developing an easy-to-use Research Kit, we are democratizing access to these tools, enabling rapid innovation and fast adoption, making the latest neuroscience breakthroughs accessible to all.",
      "Advanced brain-computer interface (BCI) technologies are very costly and difficult to use, so they are only available at the world's best research labs.",
      "The path from the lab to consumer adoption often takes multiple years and is very expensive. Ultimately, only a few individuals have access to these groundbreaking technologies. Technologies that enable controlling devices with your mind and other applications.",
      "We're here to change it!",
      "The BROADMIND Research Kit breaks down these barriers, allowing individuals to access state-of-the-art AI models, lab-grade hardware, and immersive BCI applications from home.",
      "Whether you want to play games, explore neurofeedback, or develop your own applications, BROADMIND provides an easy-to-use, ethical, and accessible solution to bring neurotechnology into everyday life.",
      "BROADMIND empowers users to take control of their technological experiences through their thoughts. With high-quality EEG hardware and seamless AI-driven software, this kit offers endless possibilities.",
      "Whether you want to play games, explore neurofeedback, or develop your own applications, BROADMIND provides an easy-to-use, ethical, and accessible solution to bring neurotechnology into everyday life.",
      "We developed a multimodal app that enables anyone to try mind-gaming out of the box. We combine eye-tracking with built-in accelerometer data and mental commands (BCI) for a smooth, precise, and inclusive BCI gaming experience accessible to everyone.",
      "Create your mental commands! Imagine pushing an enemy? to attack, cling a jaw to fire, or modulating your Alpha activity to cast a spell? in the game you love!",
      "By accessing our proprietary AI-SDK, you gain access to our SOTA AI models, which will play an important role in your interaction with the BROADMIND Device.",
      "Our apps will allow you to train your own model, leveraging our State-of-the-Art experimental models, which, for example, predict 3D hand-positioning from neural activity.",
      "Here below is a video of how one of our machine-learning models works while predicting hand movements.",
      "As you can see, we are 70-85% accurate: a new record in BCI performance!",
      "We invited a software developer to test our kit and recorded a live review of his considerations of how easy it is to work with Open-Sourse SDK and how it integrates with the BROADMIND Research Kit. He tested our open-source support and accessed raw data without any restrictions in minutes!",
      "Spoiler: he never tried it before, so this was all first and genuine feedback!",
      "A Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a technology that allows direct communication between the brain and external devices. It works by detecting brain signals, either through sensors placed on the head or implanted into the brain, and translating them into commands.",
      "This technology, once science fiction, is becoming real and practical.",
      "Researchers at the University of Texas in Austin, for example, have created a system that allows users to play video games with their minds. The system utilizes electroencephalography (EEG), which captures electrical brain activity and translates it into computer commands, making it possible for users to play games with just their thoughts.",
      "The hardware used in all of those experiments is called EEG (electroencephalography). It allows neural activity to be captured from the surface of the head while employing different Machine Learning techniques allows the decoding of those signals.",
      "We saw how users suffer from existing EEG systems (we were those people). Setting up an EEG device is a two-person job that takes quite some time (up to tens of minutes)",
      "So we decided to change it and create our own device.",
      "After two years of iterations, we developed a unique design and features that enable instant setup and ease of use.",
      "You can\u2019t find a device with this signal quality under $2,000, but we made it!",
      "We also develop and improve BCI decoding algorithms.\nImagining \"Left vs Right\" and using it as an input is fun, but we wanted to take this to the next level.",
      "We created a multimodal app that combines eye-tracking, a built-in accelerometer, and our proprietary AI algorithms to decode neural commands from the EEG. This unlocks new possibilities in performance, so even gaming with BCI is becoming viable.",
      "Imagine pushing an object, moving your hand/legs, or a specific gesture, or visualize a fireball \u2014 Our AI will decode it, and our controller app will execute your desired action.",
      "We also hired leading AI experts to create proprietary models and set new records in accuracy: 95% accuracy for MI & ME!",
      "See the chart below to analyze the specific data of the predicted hand vs. the real hand, shown in the video above.",
      "Discover mental commands that work best for you, or create your own and apply them the way you want them.",

      "Most robots of this category feature an 8 DOF (degree of freedom), which translates into less organic movements. We were not happy with the idea of limiting Mini Pupper to these constraints, so, after extensive debate within our team and research, we were eventually able to create our quadruped robot with a 12 DOF that allows it to follow biological movements but at an affordable price point that isn\u2019t made inaccessible to the average consumer.",

    "company_name": "Ignacio Cuesta",
    "allParagraphs": [
      "Wuanap inflates automatically when notices the user is unconscious while practicing any water sport!",
      "To start manufacturing Wuanap, we need to pre-order every raw material needed from 4 different providers, which are: The electronics and sensors, the automatic inflation system, the inflatable, and the external neoprene. Some of them we will receive after 6 months, so that's why we need to pre-order all of them as soon as possible. We are making this Indiegogo campaign so we are able to finance that purchases so we start manufacturing Wuanap as soon as possible to make it real.",
      "During that time, we are going to keep testing and improving Wuanap, so it will be smaller and much beautiful than it is our working prototype. Also, we will be working with Pro-athletes to have their feedback from Wuanap, so we can finally produce the best product possible.",
      "Back us to make Wuanap real!! Thank you!",
      "Every water sports athlete that requires to stay in touch with the water like swimmers, surfers, freedivers, etc, does NOT have any safety gadget that allows them to move freely and just to be inflated automatically in case there is a critical situation,... Never in the course of human history has a total and effective solution to this problem been found... until now!",
      "We are proud to introduce Wuanap, the world\u2019s only Smart Lifecollar and the first device that makes it safe to practice any water sport.",
      "Around four years ago, I had a brush with death when I almost drowned while surfing in Spain. This experience made me wonder, why isn\u2019t there a device that can keep me safe while enjoying any activity in the water? We applied for the U.S. patent in 2017, and it was finally granted in April 2019. After years of development, we are proud to present the solution that will change life as we know it.",
      "Wuanap is a comfortable neoprene life-saving collar with a motherboard equipped with state-of-the-art sensors. Coordinated by a complex algorithm, it detects a person\u2019s patterns in the water in dangerous situations and inflates automatically in a fraction of a second. We designed this flotation device to ensure that it always keeps the wearer\u2019s nose and mouth above the surface of the water, even if the wearer is unconscious or unable to move.",
      "Wuanap consists of 4 main parts. External neoprene, our patented Smart Life-collar technology, an inflatable, and an automatic complex inflation system.",
      "1. External neoprene",
      "It is divided into 2 parts, which the closer one to the neck is very flexible so it will adapt to everyone\u2019s neck and the farther which contains the inflatable and the electronics.",
      "Inside the closer one, which stays in contact with the neck, we have added an extra soft and no-grip material so it is going to make it very comfortable for the user.",
      "2. Smart Life-collar technology",
      "We have integrated a motherboard equipped with state-of-the-art sensors and a rechargeable battery inside a little box located in the back part of Wuanap, which connects through some cables to our display in the front and our barometer sensor.",
      "Our hardware is coordinated by a complex algorithm that is monitoring 100 times a second what the user is doing, and it is going to detect if you have any problem in the water, so it will start beeping for 3 to 5 seconds to notice the user that is going to inflate automatically. If the user does not go to the surface by himself, move around or press the on/off button, the collar will inflate automatically to ensure that it always keeps the wearer\u2019s nose and mouth above the surface of the water, even if the wearer is unconscious or unable to move.",
      "3. Our special inflatable",
      "We have designed an inflatable made of a material very flexible and consistent so when it is not inflated, does not require much space so we can have it inside the neoprene.",
      "In case Wuanap detects a problem and the alarm is not canceled, it will inflate, and the form we have made it is going to ensure that it always keeps the wearer\u2019s nose and mouth above the surface of the water, even if the wearer is unconscious or unable to move.",
      "4. The automatic inflation system",
      "Our inflating system is a new technology implanted to inflate anything, so we have added it to our Smart Life-collar technology, so the moment Wuanap sends the signal from our motherboard to the inflation system, the inflatable will inflate in less than a second.",
      "It is safe and to make it so, we needed to make it of one unique use, so we can ensure the correct functioning of the whole system.",
      "Did you know that when you become unconscious underwater, your brain prevents you from inhaling water for 10 to 40 seconds? Within five seconds of losing consciousness, Wuanap will get your head above water. You will start breathing and become conscious again automatically, without needing to be revived. That experience will become a simple anecdote, and you will go on enjoying life as usual.",
      "IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND?: Your brain and nervous system are perfectly coordinated when it comes to survival. As a mammal, your body has nerve receptors that automatically trigger the diving reflex when they detect water on your face. As a result, your airway snaps shut and your heart rate decreases in order to increase your survival time.\n\nWhen you get back to the surface, your nerve receptors detect it and open your airway, allowing you to start breathing autonomously and become conscious again. But this only happens if you return to the surface before the oxygen in your blood drops to the minimum level, which is why free divers always use the buddy system. If there\u2019s a problem, for example, a diver blacks out, their buddy pulls them to the surface?, and the situation ends up being an anecdote instead of a tragedy.\n\nWuanap is that buddy that gets you to the surface if you have a problem. That way you can continue enjoying your favorite activity for the rest of your life.?",
      "1. Unconsciousness:",
      "There are several reasons why you can become unconscious in the water:",
      "2. Immobility:",
      "There are also several reasons why you may become immobile in the water, although you remain conscious:",
      "3. Panic attacks:",
      "This can happen to people who do not know how to swim as well as to expert swimmers.",
      "Panic attacks in the water can be caused by an animal bite or sting, getting knocked over by a wave, a heart attack, fear, or simply not knowing how to swim. When they arise, the same thing happens to everyone unless they manage to calm down.",
      "4. Seizures",
      "The most common cause of seizures in epilepsy, but there are many other factors that can cause convulsions, which are extremely dangerous when they happen in the water:",
      "Excess consumption of alcohol after abstinence or extreme intoxication",
      "5. Breath-holding test",
      "When you receive Wuanap at home and register your product on the app with your username, one of the first questions you\u2019ll be asked is your breath-holding capacity.",
      "You\u2019ll need to hold your breath, but it is important not to prepare for the test by taking several previous breaths. This is because when you have an accident in the water, you probably won\u2019t have prepared for it by increasing the oxygen in your blood.",
      "6. Panic button",
      "If necessary, you can deliberately activate Wuanap by pressing a panic button for two seconds.",
      "7. Screaming underwater",
      "At times of danger, you could be conscious underwater, but unable to press the panic button for some reason.",
      "We have also anticipated this possibility, so if you scream underwater, Wuanap will also be activated in less than a second to get you to the surface.",
      "Here you can find some of the water sports we know Wuanap will make them much safer, but it is intended to help in any water activity where it is not involved an oxygen bottle as Scuba divers because if for any case Wuanap is activated under more than 10 meters, it will be so dangerous to the user to go fast to the surface.",

      "My first foray into the Maker Movement \u2014 before it was called that\u2014 started over 20 years ago, after stumbling across an old online web forum called Brotherhood of The Bat. This forum consisted of DIY hobbyists around the globe, and is where I was first introduced to world of small-batch manufacturing techniques, like: molding and casting resins, rubbers, and spray paints. Born out of curiosity and necessity, I began collecting as many different vendor information packets, contact cards, automotive \"Techbooks\" (used by paint and body shops), and material safety data sheets (MSDS) as I could get my hands on. This was an almost entirely self-taught and autodidact pursuit of learning through experimentation at the time, before I learned about the field of Industrial Design and was later accepted at design university to receive a formal education.",
      "Even after years of formal academic studies, I learned that many of these techniques still weren't being taught\u2014at least not altogether and in one place. If one wanted exposure, it was more of a personal pursuit. This was long before Maker Spaces or what's now known as the Maker Movement were in the mainstream vocabulary, and STEM was relegated to the hands of a lucky few.",
      "The Maker's Field Guide represents my pursuit to collect all of this type of information about production, fabrication, chemistry, garage-kit making into one resource. This pursuit has also not stopped, due to continuous improvement Kaizen.",

This book condenses everything I\u2019ve learned into an actionable, easy-to-follow guide so you can skip the pain and jump straight into building something awesome. It\u2019s the must-have tool for any creator in 2025, and honestly, it\u2019s way cooler than a PS5.",

      "Christopher Armstrong is a designer, creator, and passionate problem-solver who believes that anyone\u2014whether you're a student, teacher, parent, or curious tinkerer\u2014should be able to bring their ideas to life. After years spent working on real-world projects with brands like Sony PlayStation, Microsoft Xbox, Hot Wheels, and the NFL, he\u2019s learned that innovation isn\u2019t about fancy degrees or access to endless resources; it\u2019s about the willingness to experiment, learn, and build.",

      "iHarvest\u2122 is patent pending.",
      "iHarvest\u2122 is a beautiful indoor garden that grows up to 30 fresh fruits and vegetables in only 2.5 square feet of floor space.",
      "Designed to be beautiful in any space, iHarvest\u2122 is fully self-contained and requires minimal effort. Best of all, it can grow your produce 30-50% faster and bigger than traditional gardening systems.",
      "iHarvest\u2122 isn\u2019t your typical hydroponics system. It's beautifully designed, space-efficient, and abundant in harvest, making it one of a kind.",
      "iHarvest\u2122 makes gardening easy. It\u2019s easy to set up, easy to use, requires minimal maintenance, and looks beautiful. Plus, it grows enough plants to give you a plentiful harvest all year long.",
      "Because of its vertical design, iHarvest\u2122 takes barely any space at all and fits in virtually any room and in the smallest of apartments, no problem!",
      "Hydroponics is the most efficient way to grow plants. NASA knows it, and now you will too. Based on from NASA article \"Progressive Plant Growing is a Blooming Business\"",
      "iHarvest\u2122 uses hydroponics and cycles just the right amount of water and nutrients for plants to maintain optimal growth. There\u2019s no soil, and the system only uses a small fraction of the water and nutrients a typical garden would use, so there\u2019s no waste.",
      "Since your plants always get the perfect amount of water and nutrients and light, they spend less time and energy developing their root systems. This means your plants start growing their leaves and fruits much quicker than a traditional system and can get much larger as a result.",
      "NASA has demonstrated that aeroponically-grown (form of hydroponics) tomato plants can be transplanted in 10 days over the typical 28 days in soil - that\u2019s a 280% improvement!",
      "Since there\u2019s no soil, your plants have less chance of getting any diseases or fungal infections.",
      "Plus, because iHarvest\u2122 grows your plants indoors, you\u2019ll be able to grow with zero pesticides, zero herbicides, and have GMO-free fruits and veggies.",
      "iHarvest\u2122 takes all the benefits of hydroponics and packages them in a self-contained, easy-to-use, low-maintenance system that looks beautiful and takes up very little space.",
      "Plants need sunlight to survive, thrive, and grow. At least, that\u2019s how it used to be. iHarvest\u2122\u2019s high-efficiency LED lights were engineered to provide the most powerful and efficient spectrum of light possible, mimicking the exact light plants would normally receive from the sun. You\u2019re taking advantage of the latest advancements in lighting science!",
      "The low-energy, full-spectrum LEDs give your plants the energy of the sun, while only using the energy of a single traditional light bulb.",
      "Our LED lights are automated too, so you choose when the sun sets (lights turn off) and when the sun rises (lights turn on) - no more seasonal shifts!",
      "Your plants will get a full blast of life-giving light anywhere, anytime of the year.",
      "Eat straight from your garden! Since your plants are growing right at home, you can harvest them right when you need them. This means there\u2019s no time wasted in transport and, more importantly, no degradation in the nutritional value or freshness of your food!",
      "In the mood for a snack? Just stroll by your very own indoor garden and choose something nutritious, and delicious and bountiful.",
      "Because you harvest your produce just before eating them, you get the benefits of ALL their nutrients.",
      "Produce in stores is often harvested before it\u2019s ripe or consumed after peak freshness - that means you may not be receiving the fullest nutritional value of your produce. Harvesting your food at peak freshness means you get a dense load of vitamins, minerals, and other micronutrients with every bite!",
      "Doing your own gardening also means that you control what goes into your plants and, as a result, in your body.",
      "That\u2019s why gardening with iHarvest\u2122 means zero pesticides, zero herbicides, and zero unwanted chemicals. Plus, growing your own food allows you to grow completely GMO-free.",
      "Growing your own produce at home is not just a great way to eat healthy but to live healthy too.  In fact, we like to tell folks that indoor gardening is the next great life hack. That\u2019s because growing plants indoors has been proven to provide a number of extraordinary health benefits. For example:",
      "Plus, our full-spectrum LED lights can be used for light therapy and can help combat seasonal depression!",
      "Just by enjoying iHarvest\u2122, you can uplift your mood, increase your productivity, and live in a healthier, more vibrant space.",
      "iHarvest\u2122 is super easy to setup. In fact, people have compared it to stacking Lego\u2019s. Once you\u2019re done simply plug it in, fill with water and nutrients, and you\u2019re ready to go!",
      "To plant your seeds, drop the seed in the media, drop the media in the net pot, and see your seed sprout and grow!",
      "Get a harvest anytime of the year! Because iHarvest\u2122 is a fully self-contained system, you don\u2019t have to worry about seasons or weather.",
      "Plant and harvest anytime of the year. Some of the plants you grow will be fully mature in just 4-5 weeks time!",
      "With iHarvest\u2122, you\u2019re not just restricted to herbs - grow an assortment of plants, fruits, and vegetables!",
      "Our trellis support system allows you to grow hanging plants and fruits like squash and cucumber without a problem!",
      "From kale to cucumbers to tomatoes, you can have an eclectic mix of herbs, fruits, beans, edible flowers, and leafy greens all fresh in your home!",
      "iHarvest\u2122 is fully automated. Don\u2019t worry about watering your plants or even turning your lights on and off. The built-in timers will make sure your plants get the optimal amount of water and sunlight everyday.",
      "The only thing you need to do is plug it in and fill the reservoir with water and nutrients every two weeks or so.",
      "iHarvest\u2122 can grow up to 30 plants and vegetables simultaneously - allowing you to save $1,000 a year on groceries and countless trips to the store.",
      "It\u2019ll cost you less than $0.50 to grow a large serving of fruit or vegetable. Compare that to the many dollars it\u2019ll cost you to buy the same amount from a grocery store. You\u2019ll be able to eat healthier and spend less doing it!",
      "Though iHarvest\u2122\u2019s advanced LED lights are powerful, they\u2019re also extremely energy efficient. In fact each lamp only uses 36 watts of power.",
      "iHarvest\u2122 stacks its growing pods vertically - allowing it to grow a large amount of plants without intruding on your square footage.",
      "Growing food closer to home, while eliminating packaging and transportation of food, using 95% less water, 60% less fertilizer and eliminating pesticides, is good for you, your friends, your family, and the planet.",
      "We\u2019ve spent incredible amounts of time, effort and expense designing iHarvest\u2122 to be both functional and beautiful.",
      "Growing healthy food and owning a beautiful home should not be a compromise. We wanted you to have an indoor oasis that you\u2019d be proud to show in your living room, kitchen, office, or apartment. There are no exposed tubes or unappealing pipes here. iHarvest\u2122\u2019s design is slim, clean and appealing, matched only by the beauty of the vegetation it grows.",
      "Every detail has been reviewed to provide you with a functional work of art that is as beautiful as it is effective at growing healthy, nutritious and delicious food.",
      "You don\u2019t have to hide your delicious harvest. We made sure your lush garden can be in full display like any other work of art. The LED lights illuminate and highlight the natural beauty of your garden, and the modern design frames it elegantly against a clean, white backdrop.",
      "iHarvest\u2122 is not just a great vegetable garden - it\u2019s an amazing piece of home decor that will be the envy of every guest and the pride of your beautiful abode.",
      "iHarvest\u2122 will fit into any area you put it in. Watch it blend seamlessly with your furniture and enhance your space with a fresh, vibrant, and modern flare of life.",
      "Through growing our own food, we can educate ourselves and future generations on where our food comes from and become more mindful of how our food affects our environment. We can learn to eat healthier and more sustainably so that our wonderful planet will stay beautiful for generations to come.",
      "My name is Dave Stevens. I searched and searched for an attractive indoor gardening unit, but all I found were tiny products for growing a few herbs indoors, and giant monstrosities that don\u2019t belong in anyone\u2019s living spaces. I finally settled on purchasing a raised garden bed for my patio, but it was a disaster. It was difficult to assemble, less and less attractive as time passed, couldn\u2019t get enough light on my patio, and had to be shut down during the colder months.",
      "I realized that something needed to be done so I enlisted the help of some incredible engineers, business people, friends and family to bring iHarvest\u2122 to fruition. Approximately two years later, and after great sacrifice, here we are. The design has been perfected and verified via two prototypes, the websites up, and our Kickstarter launch is here.",
      "IGWorks\u2122 stands for Indoor Garden Works. But really, we stand for so much more. We stand for freshness and beauty in our products. We stand for clean, healthy, pesticide free food. We stand for the environment by reducing water consumption. And we stand for the reduction of CO2 and other harmful environmental pollutants that accumulate from packaging and transportation of food half way across the world. Thank you so much for being part of our community. We can\u2019t wait to grow together!",

      "Biohacking Vagus Nerve and Autonomic Nervous System\u3163Wearable device for SLEEP, STRESS & ANXIETY",
      "Our Story",
      "Aging can be thought of as a decrease in the body's ability to maintain homeostasis, our body's ability to \"self-tune\" or self-stabilize in response to stressors. Our challenge is to restore homeostasis, a unique and innate human ability, through our innovative bioelectronic technology to lead healthier lives and delay aging by stimulating the cardiac branch of the vagus nerve and correcting the imbalance of the autonomic nervous system.",
      "Chronic stress, anxiety, and lack of sleep negatively impact our immune system and its balance and increase the risk of developing or worsening diseases.",
      "The vagus nerve is the longest in the body. It is the main component of the parasympathetic nervous system of the autonomic nervous system and is the conductor of all immune defense mechanisms. If the vagal tone is activated, the parasympathetic nervous system functions properly, and the risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke are reduced. It is also good for the intestines by improving digestive metabolism and decreasing migraines. Not only will this allow you to age healthier, but it also lowers an individual's risk of death and the need for medication or hospital visits.",
      "HRV (Heart rate variability) functions as a biomarker in health and disease. It is also the best biomarker to track our longevity.",
      "The chart above shows our clinical trial results on HRV, conducted at KRISS. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, we obtained results that showed the activities of the parasympathetic nerves of the autonomic nervous system were increased by over 275% by stimulating the cardiac branch of the vagus nerve.",

      "amofit S is a unique bioelectronic wearable device that improves the overall human body by transmitting mild electromagnetic signals to the nervous system through the vagus nerve in the chest area in the form of electric currents. It improves sleep, stress, and anxiety by restoring the balance of the autonomic nervous system. It also enhances memory and creativity by promoting the generation of alpha brain waves and restores the internal balance through homeostatic autoregulation mechanism.",
      "Studies have shown that vagus nerve stimulation treatment can delay significant effects related to aging. This may help protect people from chronic diseases that are more likely to occur as people get older.",
      "'amofit S', with AMO Lab's proprietary neuromodulation technology, cVES (cervicothoracic vagus electromagnetic stimulation), targets the vagus nerve in the human's autonomic nervous system. With a mild intensity similar to the innate magnetic field generated by the human body itself, the electromagnetic signal passes through the skin, muscles, and bones without any interference. It then is transmitted to the vagus nerve in the chest area. This signal regulates the vagal tone and activates the parasympathetic nervous system.",
      "'amofit S' provides two healing modes. After powering on the device, you can switch from CALM mode to FOCUS mode by pressing the touch area. CALM mode can increase the vagal tone and activate the parasympathetic nervous system to improve sleep, stress, and anxiety and correct the body's internal balance, as well as help with chronic diseases related to problems in the vagus nerve and the autonomic nervous system. FOCUS mode can enhance memory and creativity by increasing alpha brain waves.",

      "CONCLUSION",
      "The result of analysis of ECG to evaluate the stress relaxation effects of AMO+ products are as follows:",
      "1) There were significant changes in HF ratio on ECG after use of AMO+ for a short term (2 hours). It is thought that the parasympathetic nervous system is activated by wearing the product in the experiment. It is considered that AMO+ induces relaxation and sleep because parasympathetic activation dilates blood vessels and relaxes the mind and body.\n2) However, there was no significant difference in HF ratio on ECG after use of fake product for a short term (2 hours).\n3) There were significant changes in HF ratio on ECG after use of AMO+ in a long term (72 hours). This demonstrated that AMO+ not only has the short term effects, but also provides the long term effects, activating the parasympathetic nervous system.\n4) The effect of activating the parasympathetic nervous system of AMO+ is considered effective for sympathetic hyperactivity (immune depression, increased fatigue, insomnia, etc.) suffered by many modern people due to heavy work load and stress.",
      "In a clinical trial conducted at Kyung Hee University Hospital in 2019, the sleep improvement effect was demonstrated through analysis on Insomnia Severity Index (ISI).",
      "We conducted a 30-day study with adults who self-reported sleep difficulties and after using AMO+, we found that: 95% of participants improved their overall Sleep Score; 85% were more satisfied with their sleep pattern; 75% reported positive impact on their daily functioning. A statistically significant reduction in mean Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) score from 15.7 (moderate insomnia) at baseline to 8.15 (sub-threshold insomnia) after 14 days of cVES treatment was observed. ISI score reduced by 7.55 (i.e., 48% reduction).",
      "In a clinical trial conducted at the KRISS (Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science) in 2020, EEG (brain wave), electrocardiogram (ECG) and melatonin (sleep-inducing hormone) were analyzed to demonstrate the effectiveness on the activation of parasympathetic nervous system of the ANS (autonomic nervous system) and the improvement in sleep, stress, anxiety, and brain function.",

In the electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis, the increase of alpha wave ratios in F3, F4, Fp1, and Fp2 positions in insomnia patients after wearing real devices indicates stress reduction. In the saliva test, the increase in melatonin levels in insomnia patients at nighttime indicates an increase in sleep-inducing effects. Thus, real AMO+ devices reduce stress and improve sleep induction.",

A significant difference was found in the case of HF power of ECG. The ECG HF component is a representation of vagal activity [14]. ECG HF power reflects the parasympathetic nervous system activity. The HF power increase indicates an improvement of parasympathetic nervous system activity. The rise of High Frequency (HF) components indicates improved vagal nerve activity, which is observed in Fig. 3 after using the VNS device. There is a significantly different HF ratio between ECG acquisition before VNS and after VNS device usage.",

      "This study concludes that the ECG analysis of the HF ratio for the real device shows a significant increase in the HF ratio and reduction in stress. In the EEG analysis, the increase in the alpha power ratio of F3, F4, Fp1, and Fp2 indicates stress reduction. Based on the salivary melatonin results, the nighttime melatonin level of insomnia persons after using the real device shows a significant value, resulting in induced sleep in insomnia persons. The subjective evaluation also shows a satisfactory level after the use of the real device. Thus, the real AMO+ device reduces stress and improves sleep induction. It provides sleep improvement for individuals who cannot fall asleep easily due to stress, people who sleep less than 7 hours, and people suffering from sleep problems. It is also helpful for wellness purposes for individuals such as active people who care about wellness and want to improve their body functions, people who need their heart rate and respiration rate stabilized, and people who are living uncomfortably due to stress. Although this study is limited to the analysis of bio-signals and melatonin levels, the future study will focus on full night sleep monitoring for insomnia persons in order to assess overnight sleep quality.",

      "\"It has improved sleep and anxiety.\"",
      "My parents and I have been sharing an amofit S for just over a month. It only took a week for me to notice a difference, particularly when it came to the quality of my sleep. I have a history of dysregulated sleeping patterns, often having a lot of trouble when it comes to falling asleep, and I would also wake up in the middle of the night and stay awake for hours before I could sleep again. After using the amofit S, I would fall asleep noticeably faster (up to 30 minutes faster), and if I do happen to wake up in the middle of the night, I usually stay awake for less than an hour.",
      "I also experience anxiety and panic attacks, and using this device regularly has lessened the amount of anxiety I experience, considerably. For the past two weeks my workload has increased greatly and while this would usually elicit an anxious response, I was relatively calm throughout. I did feel stressed but it was nowhere near as debilitating as it could have been. During those days I wore the device for about 3 hours per day. The amofit S technology appears create a \u201cbuffer effect,\u201d helping regulate the nervous system so that there are no extreme responses.",
      "My parents have reported better sleep. They will get up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom or wake up due to noise, but ever since using the device (they use it for anywhere between 1-3 hours a day, each) they often sleep through the whole night. I have also noticed that they are happier, get frustrated less often and laugh more. It is helping them with feeling calmer and they like to wear it while watching television or on the computer.",
      "Great job amofit S team, and thank you for bringing us this technology.",
      "\"I am so grateful for the changes I experienced.\"",
      "I have been suffering from sleep problems for decades, waking up early and with very short deep sleep period. Years ago, I started using a under-pillow device to monitor my sleep quality. As expected, the daily reports were not satisfactory. One figure in those reports worried me very much. My HRV (heart rate variability) was always below normal value, warning me of potential heart diseases.",
      "Based on some knowledge of ANS, the story of Amofit S really interested me and I thought it was worth trying out to see its effectiveness. I received my Amofit S on 11 July 2022 and started using it every day for 2 or 3 sessions of calm mode. The effect is very obvious that my total sleep period and deep sleep period are lengthened, and I feel refreshed, waking up every morning. Most amazing of all is that my HRV value has been able to fall within normal range since my first day using Amofit S.",
      "Besides, in the past when I went to sleep late or kept awake overnight, I could feel my heart beating strongly the next day. Recently, I accompanied my sister in the hospital overnight until 5 am next morning before I could have a nap of 2 hours. To my surprise, I did not have that bad feeling as it used to be, and my body recovered very quickly.",
      "In view of this, I asked my sister to try using Amofit S. She is a diabetic with hypertension, receiving constant medications. She has occasional heart palpitation. She reflected that the device did some help in reducing the occurrence of heart palpitation, and her blood pressure were not adversely affected under the coupled effect of medications and Amofit S as well. Hope that this favourable effect will persist and become more prominent in the near future.",
      "I am so grateful for the changes I experienced and hope that more and more people can benefit from Amofit S, restoring a balanced state of body.",
      "\"Just try it! I did it and I am very happy with my device!\"",
      "It works!",
      "As a high-sensitive person, I have been stressed my whole life. With aging, I became more sensible, and any negative news could derail my mood. The last couple of years, it was too much stress and my body gave me some additional health problems. I am aware about the benefits of stimulation the vagus nerve. I bought a promising gadget that needs some audio records to work properly. It did nothing for me as far as I experienced in the last two years.",
      "When I saw some advertising on Facebook about amofit S, I thought \u201cOK, it is another gadget, that will promise some stress relief\u201d. I went to the crowdfunding website and started reading the reviews. The backer asked varied questions. The response from the amofit team is impressive. They cite even detailed information about scientific studies about the function and benefits of stimulation of the vagus nerve. The customer service seems to be good as well. As a backer, I am experienced with crowdfunding over several years. You always have to be a little skeptical about promises.",
      "But with a growing level of stress and sleeping problem, I was \u201cseduced\u201d (means convinced) that could work for me. I took the plunge and ordered one amofit S. After a couple of days, I got it, recharged it and wore it overnight. Next morning it was the first night since months that I awoke without tension headache. Still skeptical, I tried not to be too optimistic. After the second night, I realised that the \u201csum-sum-sum\u201d feeling in my body was gone. It was just disappeared in the morning.",
      "After a couple of days, I felt relieved. The sticky feeling of not being able to relax was gone. I used the amofit S nearly permanent in the relax modus for about three weeks. The only break was the recharge time each day.",
      "I am starting now to use the Focus mode once a day as well, because I feel I can deal with more activities. With my stress level in the past, I couldn\u2019t handle more input. But now, I feel more balanced. The stress wheel has slowed down to 75% at least, which is an enormous relief for me. That increased my energy level, improved my concentration and my creativity comes back slowly as well. Now, I have time to be more active with people and do physical activities.",
      "Now, I reduced the use of both Calm and Focus one time per day, to maintain the positive results. I can speak just about my experience. As someone with a lot of health problems, less stress can to some miracles for the body. I know many health problems grow over the past years and it needs more time for my body to recover. But I am optimistic that it will be beneficial to give my vagus nerve some support with the amofit S.",
      "Do you wonder if this is the right gadget for you? Just try it! I did it and I am very happy with my amofit S!",
      "\"I am absolutely sure this device will have great long-term effects on my health.\"",
      "I have now used my Amofit for 1.5 months and I am amazed at the instant change in my sleep patterns.",
      "I use a Fitbit daily since years and for the last year I have become increasingly worried about the minimal amount of both my deep sleep and my REM-sleep. Normally for a night it would be around 8-10 minutes of each. I have done all kinds of things to increase this over the last year, like going to bed early, cold room, no computer/phone, etc.",
      "This changed right away when I found the Amofit. After a few nights this figure has increased to at least 1 hour of REM-sleep + more than 1 hour of deep sleep. And this has been like this now for 1.5 months, night after night. I am absolutely sure this will have great long-term effects on my health.",
      "I also tried it on in preparation for a stressful presentation for 50+ people some weeks ago. It made a HUGE instant difference in how I felt! It took away my pounding heart and stressful feeling in a few minutes. I am amazed!",
      "I am very pleased with my Amofit and 100% satisfied with this amazing product. I will also continue to explore the focus-function further. So far, I have not tried that.",
      "Thank you so much for developing this product!",
      "\"It has helped with my General Anxiety Disorder (GAD) symptoms.\"",
      "I never expected my experience to be so good! I would say it has been life-changing for me. I have been suffering with GAD (General Anxiety Disorder) for 3 years and have been prescribed many drugs which help a little but not a lot. Along with the anxiety I have an internal pulsation at the base of my spine with a general vibration spreading through me and extreme inappropriate nervousness. I noticed improvement generally within a few days of wearing my Amofit on the calm green setting for one or two full sessions a day. I feel so much calmer and my acute nervousness has diminished enormously. Now after a month on, I feel almost normal and can't thank the team at Amofit enough. My vibrations are much improved too and I sleep better which is a bonus.",
      "I look forward to using my Amofit daily and will tailor my sessions according to need. I can feel myself actually becoming calmer as the green session progresses. It's brilliant. Thank you so much!",
      "I might add that I have also been very impressed with the efficiency, speed, and aftercare supplied by your company and the discussions on the forum are so interesting and helpful. Once again, thanks so much! Who would ever have thought that this little device could be so effective? I'm so glad I found you and decided to try it!",

      "\"TRANSFORMATIVE\"",
      "I have Bipolar (and the cognitive impairment it caused) & Anxiety Disorders, all of which greatly & negatively impact on my life. I'm on optimal treatment and there is nothing more that can be done for me, medically. An Indiegogo email arrived and, most fortunately, I read it!",
      "Amofit S immediately piqued my interest. I wrote to the production team with some questions re its safety with mental illness. They replied almost instantly, sending useful links. (NB: I never saw it as a substitute for my treatment; only as a potential adjunct.)",
      "I told my psychiatrist I'd backed this and he was very interested, also to see the links. My psychotherapist, likewise. Neither had any issue with me trying it. After all, it's not a drug and works by optimising 2 helpful, natural body systems. As I am unable to work and on Disability Pension, this was a huge outlay for me. But I thought \"JUST TRY IT. You'll never know if you don't\". I was not very invested - whatever improvement, however small, I'd be happy. E.g., even a ~10% improvement would be very worth it to me.",
      "If I'm particularly stressed, I am allowed to top up my meds with valium. It works very well. I love it, but have to use it as little as possible.",
      "The day I started using Amofit S, I'd been significantly anxious & agitated, so had had one dose of valium. Hours later it was wearing off & I was clock-watching as to when I could have another dose. Then it occurred to me: \"try Amofit S first\". I honestly had NO preconceived idea of what to expect - how I might feel nor how long it would take \"to work\". So I put it on & basically forgot about it. By around the 1 hour mark I was stunned to suddenly notice \"I feel exactly like when I've had valium\".",
      "And that wasn't all. The following morning, immediately upon opening my eyes, I was struck by how profoundly peaceful I felt, plus my first thought was \"I feel normal\". I can't remember when I last felt anything resembling these. It had just paid for itself in spades.",
      "My psychotherapist said that my face looked different (in a good way) and the lines on my brow were noticeably less. I told my psychiatrist what she had said and he nodded.",
      "I keep a daily chart of my mood & energy for my psychiatrist. Having bipolar disorder, it's typically some degree of up & down fluctuations. Since starting Amofit S, the \"mood line\" has virtually flat-lined at \"neutral\". There's also been a most worthwhile improvement in energy and productivity, and frequency thereof.",
      "For weeks ALL this has very reliably continued. Needless to say, I am THRILLED. I can envisage myself using this - and any future versions - for life. As far as I'm concerned it already paid for itself in the first 24 hours of use. Worth its weight in gold. * If it were lost, stolen or broken, I would immediately order another.",

      "I am not usually someone who writes reviews but after trying Amofit S I felt compelled to as I want people having anxiety to try it as it might be the device which breaks the vicious cycle of recurring anxiety which was the case for me. I think this device maybe a gamechanger for people suffering from anxiety. 5 years back I started having anxiety due to many factors, which I don't want to get into detail about. After that stressful event, the anxiety didn\u2019t stop and I used to have massive anxiety for no specific reason throughout the day. Increase in heart rate, palpitation, throbbing head, can\u2019t concentrate on work. My heart was beating an average of 90 bpm whenever i checked. I was worried for my health and did basically everything a man can possibly do to reduce it. I tried medicines (Concor, Xanax, clonazepam, gabapentin, Phenibut, ashwagandha), GABAergic products, supplements and even regular exercise. (by the way the list of medicine that I have tried is massive)",
      "Nothing seemed to reduce it significantly, and one day when I was browsing notebookcheck.net I saw an article about Amofit S and I went ahead and joined the campaign as I am always on the lookout for anything, which can alleviate my state. When I received it I was not very confident that it could help me.  I started wearing it regularly for minimum 3 hours a day. After almost 48 days wearing it regularly. Do I feel cured?",
      "From being doubtful in the first 2 weeks if the device has any effect to actually coming to the realization that things have changed is a process of discovery. So what changed for me?\nI am calmer, my heart rate average is down generally at 68 to 70, I rarely get throbbing head anymore (as if my head or my heart is going to burst), and thoughts which promote anxiety seem less. The choking feeling in my throat and chest rarely show up and I feel my sleep is better and restful. There is something which has happened as if that state of anxiety has been pushed back. As if the boiling pot which was my head has become lukewarm. Palpitation has become very less frequent to further add.",
      "I think this device might be game changing for people with anxiety and I recommend whole heartedly to anyone who suffers this quietly. Please try it, it may and I believe it will help you. There may be patience needed with the device, so give it time if you feel it\u2019s not helping. I still feel the long-term effects and side effects, if any, should be researched. But in the 48 days I have used the change in quality of life has been massive. If it could help me who was completely consumed in anxiety for so long, then so it should help you.",
      "Love you all fighters out there. The state you are in is not irredeemable.

      "Thank you for such a wonderful product. Like most other people I was skeptical at first, but when you're in constant pain with no relief in sight you'll try just about anything. I noticed a difference from the first time I put on Amofit S. I felt calmer, less depressed and the fibromyalgia pain lessened. Migraines were much improved as well. Now that I've been using it consistently for a while, I really notice when I forget to put it on. I try to wear it for two cycles a day and then recharge. When I don't wear it, I can feel a migraine coming on, which reminds me to put it on and it stops the pain in its tracks. I have very bad reactions to medication, so it's wonderful to find something that works so well without side effects and drug hangovers. Thanks again for making Amofit S available. Your product can help so many people who are suffering to find relief.",

Like with all mental health issues we know there are connections with the gut - but wow - she feels so much better. And it has put her in a much better head space to. She says she doesn\u2019t get the low lows and the high highs. She is able to work more effectively and feels much better mentally.

    "description": "Best Small Pocket Knives for Everyday Carry | Bomber & Company urban survival & paracord gear.",
    "company_name": "Bomber & Company",
    "allParagraphs": [
      "Best Small Pocket Knives for Everyday Carry | Bomber & Company urban survival & paracord gear.",
      "After the original B-2 Nano Blade raised nearly $450K in total funding last year, it went on to become the most funded pocket knife project in history. This time around we wanted to do something different by getting all of our original backers involved in the design process.",
      "We're extremely proud to introduce the newest addition to our B-2 Pocket Knife Collection - BLITZ, a SMALL pocket knife designed and created by all of our backers!",
      "Over the past year, we asked all of you to help us design and create the ultimate pocket knife together as a community of adventurers, creators, and designers through a series of surveys, updates, and emails. This included over 1,000 surveys from 22,000 original backers and over 10,000 data points analyzed to create the World's First \"Crowd-Designed\" Project.",
      "The B-2 Pocket Knife Collection was inspired by the notorious B-2 Stealth Bomber military aircraft.  The B-2 Bomber is notably the most advanced warplanes in history. Nearly 80 percent of the aircraft is made from woven composites that incorporated glass, carbon, and graphite fibers. The B-2 BLITZ, made of 440Carbon Black Stainless Steel, is the newest addition to our collection. The original B-2 Nano Blade was designed as an everyday carry keychain pocket knife. The BLITZ is a slightly bigger, slightly beefier, and ever so slightly... more badass.",
      "Based on your feedback, we incorporated these aspects of design into our new Bomber B-2 BLITZ Pocket Knife. Our new BLITZ design is meant to be a chubby style knife. It's wider than a normal proportion of a standard knife. This allows the BLITZ pocket knife to be more durable and stronger in situations that require the use of force. It also gives a stronger grip to the user's hold. At only 3.7 inches, the B-2 BLITZ is small enough to conceal in any coin pocket. Its the first of its kind and we are absolutely sure you will love it!",
      "Dimensions  \nUltraLight Weight: < 2oz \nLength of Blade: 3.7cm \nThickness: 7cm Open Body Length: 9.5cm \nHandle Length: 5cm \nMaterials (Blade and Body): 440Carbon Black Stainless Steel \nHardness: 58-60HRC (Rockwell Hardness Scale)\nColor: Jet Black",
      "Tanto Blade - Many backers asked if we can incorporate a tanto blade into the new design. The blade has a high point with a flat grind, leading to an extremely strong point that is perfect for stabbing into hard materials. The thick point of the tanto blade contains a lot of metal near the tip, so it is able to absorb the impact from repeated piercing that would cause most other knives to break. Bonus: We are also able to utilize a serrated edge and straight edge.",
      "Small Size -  Discrete concealability is the definition of the B-2 BLITZ Pocket Knife. The B-2 BLITZ Pocket Knife will be approximately 9.5cm or 3.7 inches in length. We wanted to keep it small enough to be fully-concealable (in coin pocket) and easy to carry on a day to day basis but also heavy duty like a full pocket knife.",
      "Blade - The B-2 BLITZ Pocket Knife will have an oversize grip in width and blade which gives it a better handle for tactical use. This style of \"chubby knife\" is the first of its kind.",
      "Just like with the original B-2 Nano Blade, the B-2 BLITZ Pocket Knife incorporates both a serrated and a non-serrated precision cut blade. The non-serrated portion of the blade features a flat grind. The serrated part (teeth) of the blade, however, uses a chisel ground. We designed the serrated part of the knife to be able to scrape flint or even split wood. The blade itself is very robust and the serrated chisel can be used to wedge and pry. Offering two types of blade options gives the B-2 BLITZ Pocket Knife full tactical abilities despite its smaller form.",
      "Serrated and Straight Edge - Based on the backer data and feedback, we found that 58% of our backers wanted a straight edge and 42% of backers wanted to see a split blade. By utilizing the Tanto blade's multi-edges to have BOTH serrated and straight edge, we can have both features in one knife. Just angle the Blitz at 45 degree to designate a full straight edge. ;)",
      "440Carbon Black Stainless Steel - The entire body and blade of the Blitz will utilize 440Carbon Black Stainless Steel. 440Carbon black stainless steel makes the B-2 BLITZ one of the strongest pocket knives ever created by mankind. Rated at 58-60HRC (Rockwell Hardness Scale) the B-2 BLITZ Pocket Knife is extremely tough and will stay sharp for longer periods of use. 440C is a highly durable and corrosion resistant stainless steel. The B-2 BLITZ can endure years of outdoor wear without extra maintenance to protect the blade from rusting.",
      "Bomber Signature Perforations - Many backers mentioned adding our signature 3 perforated holes into the blade. Perforated blades allow cutting and slicing of materials to not stick onto the blade itself. It provides a cleaner, sharper cut.",
      "Heavy Duty Screws - The B-2 BLITZ Pocket Knife will utilize stronger and larger screws than the original B-2 Nano Blade. This allows the pivot point of the blade to absorb extreme impact or force meaning it will be more durable than ever.",
      "Urban Military Concept - All of our Bomber & Company products have a military design and tactical aesthetic. The B-2 BLITZ Pocket Knife is engineered to hold durability and functionality to the standard of military-grade equipment. Vincent Pilot Ng (Lead Designer) has had over 10 years of professional experience in product design. He has brought about other renown products to markets such as the Bomber Barrel Duffle Bag, original B-2 Nano Blade, and Halo Belt.",
      "Legality - As a two-handed folding blade under 3 inches in length, it is technically legal worldwide. Please double check with your local customs to make sure the knife falls within local legal restrictions.",
      "Weight - The ultralight weight of the B-2 BLITZ Pocket Knife comes in at less than 2oz making it one of the lightest, fully functional, 440C black stainless steel tactical pocket knife in the world.",
      "Folding/Locking: The B-2 BLITZ Pocket Knife is both locking and folding. Safety was one of our main concerns when it comes to a knife of this size. We wanted the design to be suitable for beginners as well as intermediate knife experts. The lock is a lever rather than a push button. You can actually use the spine to scrape flint without the worry of it coming around when the blade is locked. This makes the knife design much more robust than traditional smaller blades which are just folding.",
      "When the B-2 BLITZ Pocket Knife opens, the lever \"SNAPS\" into place to lock the blade from accidentally closing when in use. The user can feel and hear the tactile sound and click on the lock. To close, all you have to do is press the locking lever to open. Utilizing the latest manufacturing and engineering technology, we made sure to leave ZERO wiggle room.",
      "Over the past year, we have had several reiterations of prototyping as you can see below.  The first prototypes were designed out of aluminum casts and wood. After several months of collecting surveys and feedback, we added many more features including a quick access tab, serrated edges, and even a thumb grip for better stability when in use. See the below pictures.",
      "All Bomber & Company products were originally designed for ourselves. We engineer everything under strict quality and durability standards. It is our promise to provide a Lifetime Warranty for the B-2 BLITZ Pocket Knife. If it ever breaks, send it back to us and we will replace it free of charge!",
      "Examples of BLITZ B-2 NANO BLADE KNIFE USES:",
      "ABOUT US \nBomber & Company is an industrial urban product design company based out of San Francisco, CA USA with a mission to provide premium survival gear to the modern explorer. We believe that your everyday gear should be functional and minimal. We're here to design quality products that all hold a life-time warranty.",

Today, we proudly present the fastest consumer resin 3D printer in the world - Rocket 1, which is able to print at an unprecedented 380mm/h. You don't need to spend hours or days waiting anymore. With Rocket 1 you can have your designs completed within minutes.",
      "Rocket 1 is not only fast, it also prints with outstanding accuracy. With 0.035mm XY resolution and 0.001mm Z-axis resolution, Rocket 1 prints every pixel quickly and accurately, and the surface finish is exceptionally smooth and perfect.",
      "Rocket 1 projects the light from the top of the machine down to the resin surface and cures it, so there is no replaceable screen or release films required. This means less waste and lower power consumption. Of course, it also helps save you money and time.",
      "With industrial-grade quality, Rocket 1 is durable, robust, and stable with a life expectancy of more than 18,000 hours.",
      "Rocket 1\u2019s resin tank holds 3.7kg of resin, which can contain large models. However, you don't have to worry about wasting resin. HITRY developed a filling liquid that is insoluble in resin, non-toxic, reusable and inexpensive. With this liquid filling the tank, you can finish your print with only 300g of resin remaining.",
      "To avoid the resin messy when using, we enlarge the side panels by 10mm and deepen it by 5mm to allow more space to drain the overflowing resin quickly",
      "Powered by all these innovative technologies and designs, the curing parts in Rocket 1 are free from the effects of gravity and pulling forces, which leads to more possibilities in printing various materials, especially glass-like transparent models and sponge-like flexible models.",
      "How does Rocket 1 print so fast? We'll go over its technology in more detail. Digital continuous liquid forming\uff08 DCLF\uff09is a new generation of 3D printing technology developed by the HITRY team, which effectively increases printing speed and print quality by reducing the resistance of cured parts.",
      "Dead zone is the base of DCLF tech. The dead zone is a thin, liquid interface of uncured resin between the oxygen and curing zone. Light passes through the dead zone and cures the resin beneath it into a solid part. During the curing process, resin keeps flowing onto the curing part, maintaining a constant layer of liquid, hence the curing part is less affected by sinking down. Moreover, Rocket 1 increases the thickness of the dead zone by 10 times, improving printing speed and quality even more.",
      "The key to the blazing-fast printing speed is the fast-leveling photosensitive resin developed by the HITRY team. The nanomaterials in this resin cause the resin to flow into the dead zone and level quickly during printing, significantly reducing printing time.",
      "Another key feature of Rocket 1 is its top-down printing design. Unlike the bottom-up printing method, top-down printing sinks the curing model down into the resin instead of pulling it up, to avoid the influence of gravity and peeling forces. Therefore, users don't have to worry about layer separation or wrapping.",
      "Rocket 1's top-down printing design ensures that models print with little or no support, which saves a lot of time during post-processing.",
      "The top-down printing design also helps print large solid leveling models quickly and effortlessly without the need for a scraper.",
      "You don't have to be a professional to enjoy this 3D printer. Rocket 1 comes pre-calibrated and ready to use straight out of the box. There are no installation steps required, making it a true plug-and-play device.",
      "Its intuitive touchscreen makes Rocket 1 so easy to use that anyone can realize their creativity in an instant. All you have to do is choose your model file and then start printing at the touch of a button. Within minutes, you'll see the detailed print rising from the tank. Furthermore, Rocket 1's ergonomic design allows you to operate the touch screen standing up comfortably, instead of straining while bending over.",

      "Professional model repair toolset. Smart supports adding. Fast model slicing.",

Whether you're preparing meals in the great outdoors, handling everyday cutting tasks, or adding it to your collection, the Dragon Ridge Knife is your indispensable choice.",
      "We created the Dragon Ridge Knife with several goals in mind:",
      "Breaking the Mold: The market is flooded with knives that look alike, primarily because of the limitations in titanium alloy precision machining. To cut costs, most knives feature solid handles. We wanted to break this barrier by incorporating large-scale hollowed designs to reduce weight while ensuring the knife remains strong and light, making it easy to carry. We used very small milling tools to carve intricate details, making the handle's fine details truly exquisite. Additionally, we incorporated embossing on the handle to enhance the knife's overall texture and dimensionality, which is more complex and time-consuming than standard processing methods. Paired with a high-performance M390 blade, this knife is truly made for both use and collection.",
      "Inspired by the Dragon Skeleton: The hollow shape of the entire knife body resembles a dragon's bones, with a scale-like design on the back clip, adding to its aesthetic appeal.",
      "Practicality for Outdoor Use: Our work often takes us outdoors, and a knife like this is incredibly practical. It can serve as a kitchen knife for cutting meat and vegetables and can also handle tough materials.",
      "These reasons led to the birth of the Dragon Ridge Knife.",
      "The Dragon Ridge knife is designed with versatility and portability in mind. Its compact size makes it easy to carry and use anywhere. Whether you\u2019re exploring the outdoors, tackling tasks at home, or adding it to your everyday carry, its sleek design fits seamlessly into your lifestyle.

This premium steel ensures precise cuts, making your utility knife experience seamless. Whether slicing vegetables, cutting meat, or handling tough materials, the M390 blade maintains its edge longer than traditional blades.",
      "We chose M390 steel to achieve the pinnacle of craftsmanship. Creating a titanium knife with a hollowed-out design is costly and complex, but we embraced this challenge to produce a knife that is both functional and collectible. M390's hardness and resilience ensure lasting sharpness for precise cuts every time.",
      "M390 steel outperforms D2 in wear and corrosion resistance, keeping the knife sharp and reliable even under demanding conditions.

The titanium handle, with its intricate hollowed-out structure, adds depth and character while maintaining a subtle charm.",

      "1.2M dogs die in accidents yearly. Wuffguard is a car seat designed to absorb 2,000lbs of force.",
      "In fact, existing solutions weren\u2019t designed to keep dogs safe in the car. They were designed to keep the people in the car safe. This means that all the existing car solutions give you a FALSE sense of SECURITY\u2014while your dog remains at risk of injury or worse...",
      "If you are a dog parent who cares about your furry family member as you would a human family member, then you NEED Wuffguard.",
      "Finally\u2014a dog car seat solution made to actually SAVE your dog\u2019s life",
      "Wuffguard is designed to be infinitely safer than other solutions\u2014in the front AND back seat! Wuffguard is the only car seat with a net that catches your dog and does not slam them into a hard surface or propel them into someone or something else.",
      "Your insurance will NOT cover any claims involving an unrestrained dog",
      "Did you know insurance companies can deny coverage if your dog wasn\u2019t restrained properly? This can leave you with tens of thousands of dollars in repair and liability costs.",
      "Even as a great driver, you could be left with a hefty fine\u2014or worse...",
      "Did you know that animal restraint laws are getting much stricter\u2014fast? In many places, an unrestrained dog in the car will not only get you slammed with a hefty fine\u2014but you could also be charged with reckless driving or worse\u2014animal cruelty...",
      "\u201cOne second we were driving along\u2026the next we were pushed off the road, flying all over the place.\u201d\n\nOn a day like any other, dog walker and trainer Meredith LoPresti was driving her car with Husky Jasper lounging in the back seat, when her car was forced off the road, propelling Jasper out of the side window. He was killed instantly. Meredith said she\u2019d never even thought of needing a safety solution for Jasper until it was too late\u2014and now, she urges other dog parents to invest in safety solutions that could have prevented the death of her best friend Jasper.\n\nUnfortunately, Meredith\u2019s story isn\u2019t unique. Despite considering our dogs an important part of our family, many of us fail to take basic measures to keep them safe during car rides.",
      "According to the Center For Pet Safety, the science for pet safety is still at an early stage, and the goal of crash test ratings isn\u2019t actually to measure injury to the pet\u2014it\u2019s to protect human life. This means that in case of an accident, your current dog safety solution would keep YOU safe\u2014but not your furry friend...\n\nThat\u2019s why Wuffguard created a system that protects both. Wuffguard prevents injury to your dog AND prevents your dog from being propelled out of the seat and into you.",
      "As long as the seat can be pushed down, you can install Wuffguard (60-second installation!) in any seat you and your pup prefer\u2014and then keep it there as you would a child car seat! Plus it\u2019s water-resistant and machine-washable.",
      "1- Why is Wuffguard more expensive than other solutions? Because, unlike other solutions, Wuffguard is the product of two years of extensive research, and design iterations to bring you a solution that will save your dog\u2019s life in case of an accident\u2014not just claim to do it.",
      "2- Will Wuffguard fit in my car? Yes! You can easily set up Wuffguard in any car seat that you can fully reach around from front to back. This includes front seats, captain chairs, and split-bench seats.",
      "3- Set up time? 60 seconds or less!",
      "4- Will this prevent me from getting a large ticket? Guaranteed. Wuffguard meets and exceeds the requirements/guidelines for proper pet restraint in cars.",
      "5- Will this prevent me from having a claim denied by insurance? Yes! You\u2019ve done your best to keep your dog safe, and insurance companies will not be able to claim otherwise.",
      "6- What force does Wuffguard absorb? A whopping 2,000 lbs of shock... That is INSANE!",
      "7- Am I getting the best price? Guaranteed. Wuffguard\u2019s Indiegogo price is the best deal that will be available now or ever again.",
      "For more common questions, head over to our FAQ section!",
      "With its innovative, patent-pending design, Wuffguard is built to protect your dog not only during an accident, but also from the impacts of hard braking (that often occurs between 20 and 45MPH). Here\u2019s how Wuffguard provides optimal safety for your pup, step by step:",
      "Experiencing impact in a harness-based car seat is like dropping your dog off a bridge, attached to a taut rope, resulting in bruising and internal injuries\u2014or worse. Even in minor incidents.",
      "In Wuffguard, it\u2019s like falling gently into a soft but sturdy net.",
      "Which scenario would you choose for your pup?",
      "When we created Wuffguard, we knew optimal comfort was non-negotiable for our furry friends. Wuffguard is stretchable and extends across the entire car seat, so your dog can feel free while staying safe. Wuffguard stays put, and the blue color provides your dog even further comfort (it\u2019s one of the colors dogs see best!)",
      "Included with your Wuffguard VIP or Early Bird purchase, you\u2019ll get our two essential add-ons: The Pup-Proof Lining and the Snuggle Buddy Pillow.",
      "Can\u2019t get enough Wuffguard? Add on any of our \u201cultimutt\u201d optional accessories to make your fur baby\u2019s ride even better:",
      "*Note: If you are not a VIP or Early Bird backer, we recommend adding the Pup-Proof Lining and Snuggle Buddy Pillow to your order.",
      "Say goodbye to restrictive, pricey, and inconvenient car seats that don\u2019t actually keep your furry friend safe in an accident. Say hello to Wuffguard. Here are just a few things that make Wuffguard unique in this market:",
      "Existing car safety solutions for dogs are inadequate. Wuffguard can save dog lives\u2014without being restrictive or inconvenient (it takes only a minute to set up)! The patent-pending design is the industry\u2019s first to offer a crash safety zone and a 7-point shock absorption system, and it extends across the entire car seat for optimal freedom.",
      "It\u2019s estimated that over 30 million dogs ride unprotected in cars every month in the US alone.\n\nIf a car crashes at just 25mph, an unprotected dog can be propelled forward at a force equal to 40 times its weight. This leads to countless injuries and fatalities.\n\n And in the case of hard braking\u2014which happens much more often than accidents\u2014slowing down from 45 to 20mph in two seconds throws an unprotected dog forward with a force equal to its own weight, causing trauma and injury especially in small dogs.\n\nIn either case, most existing devices couldn\u2019t prevent injuries and fatalities\u2014but Wuffguard can.",
      "The majority of available car seats for dogs fall into two categories: flimsy baskets requiring a harness (can\u2019t accommodate medium dogs) and harness-based devices for the back seat (can\u2019t accommodate smaller dogs).\n\n Wuffguard is the safe, comfortable option that works better than both the harness or the flimsy basket.",
      "Wuffguard has a unique, patent-pending design with a range of science-based features that work in perfect harmony to save lives.",
      "With Wuffguard, set-up is easy and takes less than a minute every time, so you and your furry best friend can get where you need to go ASAP.",
      "Did pup take a dive in the lake? No pawblem. Wuffguard is water-resistant, and our waterproof Pup-Proof Lining accessory can hold up to a gallon of water!",
      "Stricter laws are starting to be implemented across the world concerning dog car safety, with an increasing number of US states charging drivers hefty fines under distracted driving laws. Some states have banned unrestrained dogs in the front seat or altogether, and so has the UK. Countries including Germany and Canada are following suit.\n \nAs this trend continues, keeping your dog safe during car rides will no longer be a question of morality and choice, but also of legal and financial consequences.",
      "The unexpected strikes fast, and it can get really expensive even faster. You might find that your pet insurance is less than helpful\u2014in fact, they\u2019ll deny your claim if your pup was unrestrained\u2014or that you have to pay large sums out of pocket.",
      "This could be financially devastating. The average cost of an emergency vet bill is $800-$1500, and surgery after a car accident can rack up $10,000 in medical bills with the vet\u2014easily.\n\n And that\u2019s if you\u2019re lucky and your dog stands a chance\u201412.5% of car accidents are fatal to the dog involved.",
      "There\u2019s no comparison to Wuffguard when it comes to safety, comfort, and freedom. Your furry friend will be safe and cozy, and you can chat and enjoy the scenery together, next to each other.",
      "The Wuffguard team is business experience, creativity, and a deep love of animals\u2014all wrapped up in one pup-approved package.",
      "Wuffguard\u2019s inventor, Kurban, was on a 4-year work assignment in Kenya and his youngest daughter Sabrina was having a hard time adjusting to their new life there\u2014a world away from their home in Canada.\n\n In a stroke of luck, Kurban\u2019s coworker\u2019s American Eskimo had a litter of puppies, and Kurban decided that a new furry family member would brighten up the family\u2019s African adventure.",
      "When Kurban arrived at his coworker\u2019s farm one day, a wet, dirty lump came wobbling towards him. It was Momo, looking for her forever home\u2014and love at first sight for Kurban.",
      "What a surprise Sabrina got when she opened the car door after school that day to find a tiny, dirty farm puppy looking up at her with big eyes! After a thorough, loving bath, Momo went from brown to white, transforming into a gorgeous dog who would become an important member of the family\u2014which she\u2019s been for nine great years now.",
      "The family eventually moved back to Canada and Momo\u2019s truly loving life there\u2014as playful as that wet, dirty puppy, but dry and warm in cozy sweaters in Spring, Autumn, and Winter (she has yet to acclimate to the cold weather!)",
      "Kurban and his family took Momo everywhere with them, and when it was just her and Kurban, Momo preferred being in the front seat of the car, next to him. But after a major car accident that left Kurban on a walker and crutches for three months, he realized that, had Momo been with him, she would have been killed.\n\n Kurban immediately began researching car seats for dogs but wasn\u2019t able to find one that accommodated small to medium-sized dogs in the front seat. Thus, Wuffguard was born\u2014out of a desire to keep Momo, and other dogs like her, safe and happy.",
      "We\u2019ve gone through many technical enhancements and various prototypes before reaching the current version of Wuffguard. Here are some of the steps we've taken to ensure that Wuffguard is the safest solution on the market:\n\n 1) Our first prototype had no padding, no crumple zone, aluminum front posts, and an aluminum bar. From the aluminum bar, the idea of a crumple zone came up.",
      "2) Next, we included a plastic bar that would bend or break after 240 pounds of force shock absorption.",
      "3) We decreased the gaps in Wuffguard\u2019s webbing to accommodate smaller dogs.",
      "4) We made Wuffguard more secure by extending the back and side height and angling the sides to make it harder for a dog to jump out.",
      "5) We improved shock absorption by adding padding to the front of Wuffguard and by adding elasticity to the webbing.",
      "6) We created the Pup-Proof lining, which protects car seats from muddy paws and accidental spills.",
      "7) We created the Wooftastic Netting that keeps hard-to-restrain dogs safely secure in Wuffguard.",
      "8) For our latest version, we created a restraint system: the Safety Clip Cord, which is long enough to allow a dog to reach the front of Wuffguard but no further.",
      "We\u2019re confident that our Wuffguard manufacturing and shipping timeline takes into account all foreseeable factors. However, in any manufacturing process, unforeseen delays can be a factor. Political instability, natural disasters, or a pandemic resurgence could all cause supply chain issues. Should any risks or challenges arise, our number one priority will be to communicate with you and do everything we can to mitigate the delay. We\u2019re so grateful for your support in this project, and we appreciate you being a part of our mission to save dogs\u2019 lives via safer car travel.",

      "Discover the magic of botanical and spice essence with Mufee. Easily make essential oils, hydrosols, infusion oils, and more, right from your home.",
      "\u25cf Simple: Add your botanicals, tap the screen, and let Mufee do the rest.",
      "\u25cf Efficient: Distillation ensures a clean and efficient process.",
      "\u25cf Versatile: Create a variety of products, from essential oils to infused butter.",
      "With just a few simple steps, you can easily create your own unique essential oils. Set it and forget it!",
      "\ufe31Essential oil making steps",
      "1.  Cleaning flowers \n2. Add pure water and flowers to the pod\n3. Set the temp & time, Starts\n4. Get your essential oils",
      "The distillation is first initiated with a temperature between 80 and 85 degrees. Gradually, steam is formed. It then deposits itself onto the plants and captures all their aromatic molecules. Afterwards, it condenses by passing through a refrigerant. As the steam comes into contact with it, it cools and then liquefies to produce the distillate, which we collect in a container shortly afterward. As a result of this vacuum distillation, circle cooling system, and oil-water separation, our organic Lavender essential oil, and hydrosol, both 100% natural and organic, are obtained in a short time. This unique technique mainly allows us to preserve the finest organoleptic properties of the plants for superior end products.",
      "MUFEE's PID temperature control technology and suggested time setting make the extraction of essential oils more efficient.",
      "Two of MUFEE's key design features address the water wastage issue common in traditional distillation systems. Firstly, our condenser utilizes a closed-loop cooling system, eliminating the need for a constant water supply. Secondly, we employ vacuum pressure to physically separate oil and water, replacing the traditional method of running tap water. In traditional distillation, consuming over 20L of water to distill just 1L of material is not uncommon. MUFEE, however, achieves zero water waste. Furthermore, MUFEE's distillation and infusion functions allow users to transform fresh flowers or unused spices into fragrant essential oils, promoting resource conservation.",
      "MUFEE distilled essential oil is designed to add up to 1L of water. Under normal circumstances, the extracted spices are enough. However, to make the essential oil extraction more efficient, we are equipped with a 350ML water replenishing tank. When extracting essential oils, please check in advance whether the water replenishing tank is sufficient. It is recommended to use distilled water.",
      "Many essential oils need to be diluted to help with its tolerability and minimize the chances of irritation. This can be done by mixing it with a carrier oil, such as coconut oil, jojoba oil, olive oil, argan oil, grapeseed oil, or avocado oil. After dilution, she recommends doing a small patch test first to gauge how your skin will react to the mixture. If there isn\u2019t any irritation, then you can start applying it on larger areas.",
      "You can incorporate essential oils\u201d like lavender or chamomile \u201cat the end of a hard day to decrease stress as part of your aromatherapy routine. Johns Hopkins Medicine cites aromatherapy accessories (such as bracelets that can absorb essential oils for you to sniff throughout the day) and aroma sticks as the best ways to use essential oils through aromatherapy.",
      "What carrier liquids are best? Olive oil, avocado oil, coconut oil, MCT oil, butter, ghee, vegetable glycerine, and honey are also available",
      "1.  Add the herbs or spices into the Infusion pod\n2. Add the base oils\n3. Set the time & temperature and click start\n4. Get your infused oils",
      "Mufee\u2019s intuitive infusion function offers a comprehensive solution, automating processes like drying and decarboxylation to simplify the creation of tailored extracts.",
      "Oil infusion involves the process of adding any herb or botanical to a carrier oil, butter or fat of your choosing. This process infuses the goodness of the ingredients into the oil, making it a healthier choice for cooking, consumption or topical use. With just a few simple ingredients you can create an extensive range of creations that will impress even the most discerning palates!",
      "MUFEE's technology significantly accelerates this process, resulting in a high-quality infused oil that can be used in a variety of applications. From baking and cooking to food sauces, butter, chocolate, and gummies, the possibilities are truly endless.",
      "Essential oil and hydrosol extraction share a common starting point: steam. However, the end products differ significantly. Essential oil extraction involves a high-temperature process that isolates the concentrated aromatic compounds of the plant, resulting in a viscous oil. Hydrosol extraction, conversely, produces fragrant water that retains many of the plant's water-soluble properties.",
      "Rosewater, a natural hydrating powerhouse, locks in moisture, leaving your skin supple and refreshed. A single 150ml bottle can last up to 15 days, making it both efficient and affordable.",
      "Disinfection: Spray your garments from 20-30cm away to prevent oversaturation. Target areas like collars and cuffs where odors tend to linger. Ironing after application enhances fragrance diffusion.",
      "Sleep Aid: Lavender and chamomile in our hydrosol promote relaxation and restful sleep. Avoid over-spraying to prevent overpowering scents.",
      "Each step could be easily set up with Mufee's panel which makes your scent journey simple.",
      "After three years of intensive research and development, MUFEE is the result of a perfect blend of aesthetics and functionality. Its innovative lifting design, refined through countless iterations, ensures it fits seamlessly into any home or workspace.",
      "We owe Kickstarter backers an apology. Due to an oversight by our previous design team, the placeholder photos from the template were not replaced with our actual team photos. This was never our intention, and we take full responsibility for the mistake.",
      "MUFEE was born out of our extensive collaboration with the vast agricultural and horticultural communities in Utah. Our team is passionate about nature and believes in the power of plants. We\u2019re inspired by their life-giving energy and their constant striving towards the sun. Since some of us also love to cook, we decided to create a 2-in-1 machine that combines our love for nature, healthy living, and food.",
      "We recognized the limitations of traditional distillation methods, including operational complexity, safety risks, water wastage, and low extraction efficiency. We also noticed that the full potential of essential oils and infused oils wasn't being realized due to the challenges associated with their extraction.",
      "Our team sought to address this by developing a user-friendly, high-quality extraction and infusion machine suitable for home, restaurant, bar, and small workshop settings. We collaborated with professionals and traditional users to identify the pain points of copper pot stills, such as complex setup, space requirements, and water consumption.",
      "Our solution combines the heating needs of extraction and infusion with electronic temperature control and a closed-loop cooling system to create a safe, efficient, and energy-saving device. Through rigorous testing and refinement, we've achieved a balance between ease of use and professional performance.",
      "MUFEE isn't just a machine; it's a catalyst for a new lifestyle experience. Unleash your creativity and craft unique DIY products. We value your feedback as we continue to optimize MUFEE and shape its future.",
      "Our team has extensive experience in electronic product design, development, and production. We're excited to introduce our latest innovation.

      "My wife was running her food truck, The Coop, while I was finishing my degree in mechanical engineering. I had to go and fix things for her regularly, so I began to carry more tools on me, trying to make quick fixes and get back to studying. One day, under the counter working on a leak, frustrated with the nut and bolt prowess of the multi-tool I always carried, the idea for the Omnilock\u2122 began to take shape in my head. I decided to try and design my dream multi-tool, one that could take advantage of the new wrench design to the fullest. I\u2019m very happy with the results, and I\u2019ve not carried another tool since the first UNION\u2122 prototypes were built.",

      "Get the optical performance of a professional desktop microscope with any typical smartphone!",
      "We are now working hard in full power to process the shipping for KS backers. I understand you are waiting for the newest progress on the project. It is also essential for the communication to update you on the project status. So we are glad to let you know some progress.",
      "1. Production.",
      "According to our schedule, we would start shipping in March for Kickstarter backers and in April for Indiegogo backers. So we worked hard since the campaign's success at Kickstarter and even started early preparation before the campaign ended. We got every step well organized, and finally, at the end of February, we had enough inventory to start shipment in March.",
      "2. Shipping progress",
      "We started the shipping process on March 10th, 2021, for Kickstarter backers. It is about 9000 packages to be sent (11000 including the Indiegogo In-demand orders). So it is a challenging task and needs some time to finish. I would like to show you some pictures to let you know the process.",
      "We estimated to finish the shipment for most of the Kickstarter backers at the end of March. So we can start shipping for Indiegogo backers in April 2021 as scheduled.",
      "In 2018, we took Kickstarter and Indiegogo by storm with the first Fingertip Microscope - iMicro Q, earning 6000 pledges from the community and over 10000 iMicro Q delivered to our backers. Since then, we've launched another iMicro C in 2019, with a longer working distance and a broader field of view. We delivered over 14000 Fingertip Microscopes units with these two successful, accomplished campaigns to microscope fans in over 70 countries. It is a breakthrough in portable microscopy - we're quite proud, and thank you all for your support.",
      "We never stop - now we've taken our effort one step further and are pleased to bring you the new, improved version of the fingertip microscope - iMicro Q2.",
      "Since Antony van Leeuwenhoek invented his microscope in the 17th century, there has been tremendous progress in microscope technology. Microscopes with excellent performance are usually bulky, heavy, and expensive, even for portable ones. With our years of effort, what we introduced in 2018 - the fingertip microscope iMicro Q - is a real breakthrough in mobile microscopy. It has the comparable optical performance to a professional desktop microscope and enables you to carry it as easily as you bring your phone. In addition to the iMicro Q's excellent optical performance and portability, iMicro Q2 has a new design to enable it to work with any smartphone.",
      "Here are some micrographs taken with iMicro Q2 (using an iPhone 11):",
      "It has the same high magnification as iMicro Q. When used with a smartphone, it can observe, for example, at full view, the mouth part of the housefly at a magnification of ~100x and then zoom in detail up to 800x magnification. It is able clearly to see the spiral structure of the tip of the mouthpart at high magnification. If you don't have a microscope, you never know a housefly has such a fine structure at its mouth part. It is amazing!",
      "The clear observation of the spiral structure of the mouth part of the housefly is already proof of its high resolution. We did some further tests: the USAF 1951 resolution test chart was used to test the resolution of iMicro Q2 on an iPhone 11. The intervals between the finest test bars are 2.19 micrometers. The finest test bars on the 7th group are clearly seen, indicating its resolution is far beyond that.",
      "A grid calibration target was used to test the distortion. Even in full view at the edge of the visual field, no noticeable distortion was observed.",
      "Based on this optical performance test, iMicro Q2 has excellent optical performance, definitely comparable to a desktop compound microscope.",
      "A stem of xylophytadicotylendon T.S. was observed under iMicro Q2 as well as a desktop microscope Motic DMB-1223 (price ~2200USD for microscope + 500USD for camera attachment). No noticeable difference was observed, as shown in a side-by-side comparison.",
      "It is about the size of a fingertip and weighs only 0.5g (~1/60 oz). It is very thin, only 3.2mm (1/8 inch). No parts extrude beyond the edge of your phone when it is installed. Also, We considered the package's portability from the beginning of the design. It is packed in a card-size thin PP case, which is easy to fit into your wallet!",
      "The Fingertip microscope differs from a comprehensive desktop microscope - it does not introduce a bulky and expensive focus-tuning system. In contrast, the iMicro Q2 has no knobs and buttons at all. Compared with the original iMicro Q, the new iMicro Q2 is more comfortable to align and attach to your phone's camera. Just connect and point closely toward what you want to see, and it works!",
      "We are very proud of the Fingertip Microscope and would like everyone to be able to afford it. Even though it has such an excellent performance, we tagged it with an attractive price: ~1 percent of a traditional desktop microscope cost. With the money you would need to buy a traditional desktop microscope, you can purchase many Fingertip Microscopes, making this great for children and students.",
      "When we launched iMicro Q, we were often asked: does this work with my phone? There is no more confusion with iMicro Q2: We design it to work with any phone with a camera. iMicro Q2 will be coupled to your smartphone by an innovative, re-useable, nano-suction pad. Whether your phone has a single back camera or multiple back cameras, a flat camera(s), or extruded camera(s), the iMicro Q2 will work with them all. Please see the picture for your reference to see how it looks with different camera configurations.",
      "The magnification mainly relies on its complex optical system for traditional compound microscopes, including objective and eyepiece. Its total magnification is a combination of the magnification of the objective and eyepiece.",
      "For our fingertip microscope, three stages of magnification are combined to achieve the total magnification. First, the lens provides optical magnification to generate the image on the smartphone camera's sensor; second, the image on the sensor is displayed on the much larger screen via the electronic process and magnification; third, digital zoom provides further magnification as a digital magnification to the image. The total magnification is a combination of these three.",
      "Therefore, iMicro Q2 uses a different process and technology compared to a traditional microscope. Thanks to the advance of micro-optics and smartphone technology, and with the effort and expertise accumulated in the past years, we have enabled iMicro Q2 to achieve excellent performance at a low cost.",
      "We have walked a long way to develop these smartphone-based microscopic tools since registering the first patent in 2012. We have already successfully built a series of smartphone microscope products, including iMICROSCOPE, iMICROSCOPE R, and the \u03bcRuler, iMicro Q, iMicro C, as well as this new version iMicro Q2.",
      "We have shaped and polished our Fingertip Microscope idea according to previous backers' and customers' suggestions and comments based on our previous successful projects. We have optimized the optics and the overall design, and each step was tested and refined using prototypes to achieve the best performance possible.",
      "The lens is a crucial component of the system. A small ball lens (van Leeuwenhoek) is a straightforward approach. But it is well known to suffer from a very limited usable field of view due to severe field curvature effects, spherical and other aberrations. The iMicro Q2 uses a more complex multi-aspherical lens with a dedicated design to achieve both high performance of magnification and low aberration.",
      "Light and illumination are essential to microscopy. Nowadays, every smartphone comes with a camera as well as a flashlight. The original iMicro Q used a light guide technique to introduce the light to the point of the lens field of view. iMicro Q is a great design but incurs a compatibility problem with some phones with a long distance between the camera lens and flash.",
      "In iMicro Q2, we incorporated a new innovative design: Reflective/Transmission illumination. In this design, the thin PP case is not only used to pack and protect the product but also used as a light-reflective illumination box. The light from the flashlight and ambient light goes into the transparent light guide to illuminate the sample. Simultaneously, the light is also reflected from the thin PP case's bottom wall to illuminate the sample. Because of this design, the Reflection/Transmission illumination achieves its high performance with flexibility to work with all the different phone camera lens-flash configurations, therefore being compatible with any smartphone. Even for the phones/pads which do not have a flashlight, it works well with just good ambient light illumination or using close to an ambient light source.",
      "Compared to conventional adhesive, the nano suction pad mimics gecko's foot-pads: it has thousands of micro air pockets functioning like micro-suction cups to hold the device to the phone.",
      "Every on-and-off application will leave nothing on the phone. This newly developed \"nano suction pad\" is residue-free, non-tacky, and repeatable. The use of a nano-suction pad has been proved in our previous product, and it is repeatable and easily cleaned by a PSA tape (such as Scotch tape).",
      "Every smartphone now has an auto-focus function. This automatic focus function also works when iMicro Q2 is coupled with your smartphone. We have precisely designed and machined iMicro Q2 to control the focus point accurately. As long as you point it closely towards a sample plane, the sample falls into the autofocus range, and it will automatically focus for a clear image.",
      "A high-quality \u03bcRuler (stage micrometer) will be provided (as an option) with iMicro Q2 to calibrate the scale-bar in our App, i-Seeing, and enable you to measure size accurately. Please see our previous campaign, \u03bcRuler- A micro-ruler to measure micro-objects, for more information.",
      "iMicro Q2 actually works with any camera App which can control the flashlight when shooting. In some cases, it is crucial to have a scale-bar and ensure its accuracy on the micrograph. The dedicated App, i-Seeing, was designed to take micrographs to meet professional demand. The scale-bar on the micrograph can be toggled on/off to enable you to embed a scale-bar on the image if required.",
      "The iMicro Q2 is very easy to align and attach to the phone's camera. Just connect and point closely towards what you want to see, and it works!",
      "The iMicro Q2 is very easy to align and attach to the phone's camera. Just connect and point closely toward what you want to see, and it works!",
      "The picture shows the comparison of the same scale target being observed with iMicro C and iMicro Q2 (when no digital zoom is applied), so you can compare their visual field. They are complementary: iMicro C has a lower magnification and a larger visual field, while iMicro Q2 has a higher magnification and a high resolution. The detailed comparison between iMicro Q2 and iMicro C is shown in the table. They are both suitable for different yet complementary purposes.",
      "It is super portable, and you don't need complicated settings, so you can immediately take images, use them for reporting, and transfer images to your colleagues. Plus, you can use it with any smartphone. It can be used in many professions where you need accurate changes and immediate research in the field. For example, it can monitor a knife's sharpening process, check the masks' quality, and measure small machinery parts' quality. It can also check the mounting of samples on a TEM grid, check the quality and texture of cloth, identify counterfeit, evaluate the printing quality, and check the flaws in jewelry and many other applications. It is not just a tool and can also be used for a lot of fun: parents might use it during play to explore the wonderful micro-world with their child.",
      "Many of our previous backers shared their beautiful and amazing pictures when they used the fingertip microscopes. Here are a few examples of previous backers' photos with the iMicro Q and iMicro C on their phones.",

    "company_name": "Natasha Egan",
    "allParagraphs": [
      "When drug risks are hidden, real-world data speaks. Built to protect pets-and inform those who care.",
      "We\u2019re a team led by a founder who is a seasoned tech product manager with a background in launching data and AI platforms that transform complex data into tools people and businesses can actually use. This work began after one of our own lost a beloved cat to a newly approved opioid - one no vet warned about, and whose serious side effects no one could explain until it was too late.",
      "What started as grief turned into a mission - and now, a platform in development. We\u2019re building RiskSignalData with a small but dedicated team of engineers, former FDA experts, and scientific advisors. The concept has already received early validation from the National Science Foundation.",
      "We believe pet parents - and the professionals who care for animals - deserve better tools, better information, and better outcomes. RiskSignalData is how we begin delivering that.",
      "RiskSignalData is the first AI platform designed to bring  transparency to veterinary drug safety. It transforms decades of FDA CVM drug safety data - reported by veterinarians and the public - into a searchable, AI-powered interface that lets users ask questions in a ChatGPT-style format. It\u2019s designed for everyone who makes decisions about pet and animal care - pet parents, veterinarians, insurers, and others.",
      "With your support, we\u2019ll move closer from proof of concept to launch-ready infrastructure. This funding will allow us to build the first tool that makes veterinary drug risks visible - before another pet suffers or dies needlessly. Contributors will help create a system that empowers pet parents, equips veterinarians, and arms advocates and others with real-world data, while exposing the dangers pharmaceutical companies keep buried. We've talked to hundreds of pet parents who've shared the same pain points, the same frustration, and in too many cases, the same devastating loss.",
      "We\u2019re raising $25,000 to build the first working version of RiskSignalData - an AI-powered platform that makes hidden veterinary drug risks finally searchable and understandable.",
      "Your support will fund:",
      "We\u2019ve already invested personal funds to cover 18-month long research, technical scoping, and early design. This next step - what you\u2019ll help fund- gets us from idea to MVP: a usable version that people can access and learn from.",
      "We\u2019re offering early access and real involvement. Backers will receive behind-the-scenes updates, early access to the platform, and the opportunity to help shape which features get built first. This isn\u2019t just support - it\u2019s partnership in building a tool that could save lives.",
      "If we don\u2019t reach the full goal, we\u2019ll focus on building a leaner version of the platform with core functionality. That includes searchable FDA CVM drug safety data and a simplified user interface. It may not include the advanced AI model right away - but it will still serve pet parents who need answers now. Every dollar will go directly toward development, and nothing will be wasted.",
      "Veterinary drug safety is a silent crisis. New drugs are approved after being tested on small groups of young, healthy animals. The real-world risks - seizures, organ failure, cancer, death - aren\u2019t discovered until after the drug is already in widespread use. And even then, the public isn\u2019t warned.",
      "The FDA doesn\u2019t disclose the drug\u2019s name in its after-market drug safety data. The data is buried in raw files that require technical skill to even read. There\u2019s no dashboard. No alerts. No access for the people who need it most - pet parents and veterinarians making life-and-death decisions every day.",
      "RiskSignalData will change that. Our platform will use advanced AI to detect patterns across millions of records - uncovering risk signals that would otherwise remain hidden. Anyone will be able to ask a plain language question and get a clear answer about what risks have already been reported.",
      "The same question you\u2019d ask a vet -\u201cHow safe is this drug?\u201d - you\u2019ll be able to ask our system. And it will answer, using real-world data, not the sanitized version pharmaceutical companies choose to share.",
      "We\u2019ve done this before! Our team\u2019s background includes building complex data and AI platforms for organizations like Oaktree Capital Management, Disney, LiveRamp, and a blockchain startup, to name a few. We know how to turn fragmented, high-stakes information into platforms that are clear, usable, profitable, and built for real-world impact.",
      "Now we\u2019re applying that experience to one of the most overlooked corners of medicine - veterinary drug safety.",
      "We're not a pharmaceutical company. We're not a government agency. We're people who've lived through the loss, confusion, and helplessness that comes when a pet if harmed by a drug no one warned us about.",
      "We\u2019re building this platform because it didn\u2019t exist when we needed it. With your help, it finally can - so no one else has to learn the truth too late.",
      "Building an advanced AI platform that processes drug safety data isn\u2019t simple. The datasets are massive, inconsistent, and sometimes incomplete. Making that information accessible, accurate, and responsible takes both technical skill and ethical care.",
      "We\u2019re also developing in a highly sensitive space. Veterinary drug safety is emotionally charged, legally complex, and often entangled in industry politics. There\u2019s no roadmap for what we\u2019re building - but we believe that\u2019s exactly why it\u2019s needed.",

      "Propel wasn\u2019t just built to be versatile \u2014 it was built to be welcoming. Because the best ride isn\u2019t the fastest. It\u2019s the one everyone can enjoy.",
      "We started with a simple idea: what if everybody could ride?",
      "Not just the thrill-seeker or athlete, but the curious. The cautious.\nThe ones who say, \u201cI\u2019ll just watch.\u201d The dad who wants to fly, but also cruise with his kid.\nThe friend who\u2019s never stepped on a board. The partner who\u2019s up for it \u2014 if it feels easy enough. The teen who wants to send it in Jet Kart\u2122 mode.\n\nAll on the same board. In the same session.",
      "So we stripped away the barriers: the gear, the guesswork, the intimidation. And replaced them with something better: click, swap, ride.",
      "One chassis. One battery. One board. Five ride modes. Infinite shared memories.\nFrom beach house to boat, dock to daytrip \u2014 Propel turns any body of water into a playground. No pressure. No prep. Just that quiet smile when someone says: \u201cWait\u2026 I got this.\u201d",
      "Propel was developed with safety at its core \u2014 featuring an enclosed jet propeller (no exposed blades) and a stability-first inflatable board. It\u2019s welcoming for families, teens, parents, and even grandparents. If you can stand or sit, you can ride Propel.",
      "Deflate or disassemble Propel and it fits into two compact wheeled bags for easy transport. It packs neatly into your car trunk or boat \u2014 no trailer or garage space needed. Bring it anywhere and turn any body of water into your playground.",
      "Don\u2019t let the approachability fool you \u2014 Propel Foil delivers adrenaline for even seasoned riders. It\u2019s fast, fun, and ultra-quiet \u2014 combining the freedom of a foil with the thrill of a jetski. And with extended ride time built in, the fun doesn\u2019t have to end early. Just flow, freedom, and full-throttle excitement.",
      "At the core of Propel is our Universal Chassis System (UCS) \u2014 engineered for durability and seamless integration across all five ride modes. Each V-hull inflatable board and Jet Kart\u2122 hull wraps around it, creating a stable platform for any riding style. All major components \u2014 including the motor, handlebar, and foil system \u2014 connect using tool-free, quick-turn hardware, so you can switch modes in minutes. Whether you\u2019re standing, seated, or flying above the water, every part works together \u2014 smoothly and securely.",
      "Propel was designed with safety at its core \u2014 so anyone can ride with confidence. From the soft, stable inflatable boards to the padded handlebar and auto-shutdown magnetic safety leash, every detail helps riders feel supported from the start. The QuietJet\u2122 thruster system, used in E-Scooter, E-SUP, and Jet Kart\u2122 modes, features vector steering controlled through the wireless remote, plus multiple throttle profiles so riders can start slow and unlock power as they progress. Whether you\u2019re guiding your kids, cruising solo, or riding seated in Jet Kart\u2122 mode, Propel keeps every ride comfortable, predictable, and fun.",
      "With a high-capacity 50.4V/50Ah Smart BMS battery, Propel delivers up to 3 hours* of ride time in eFoil mode \u2014 that\u2019s 2\u20133x longer than many electric boards. In thruster-powered modes like E-SUP and Jet Kart\u2122, expect 30 to 60 minutes of ride time depending on rider weight, speed, and conditions. Built-in safety features include thermal, voltage, and current protection, plus a magnetic leash that shuts off the motor if you fall. Our dual-circuit system keeps charging and riding separate, and the battery mounts securely without tools. Fast charging (~2 hours) gets you back on the water quickly.",
      "Propel\u2019s QuietJet\u2122 propulsion system delivers up to 10kW of FOC-controlled thrust for buttery-smooth acceleration and speeds up to 25 mph (40 km/h) in eFoil mode. In thruster-powered E-Scooter, E-SUP, and Jet Kart\u2122 modes, riders cruise comfortably between 6\u201312 mph (10\u201320 km/h) with stable, intuitive control. A dual-purpose wireless remote with multiple throttle profiles lets riders start slow and unlock power as they progress, while the QuietJet\u2122 thruster adds vector steering for precise directional control.

Every component is built for real-world durability \u2014 from reinforced electronics to saltwater-rated, IP67\u2013IP68 waterproof materials.",
      "Propel isn\u2019t just another electric watercraft \u2014 it\u2019s a complete 5-in-1 system built for maximum versatility, beginner-friendly access, and unbeatable value. While other brands limit you to one or two modes, Propel delivers five, with fast, tool-free setup, a portable inflatable design, and even Jet Kart\u2122 mode for seated fun. You get longer battery life, better portability, and the freedom to ride however you want \u2014 all in one package.",
      "Propel is for anyone and everyone who loves the water or just wants to experience something truly new. We\u2019ve seen kids, parents, and even grandparents light up during our test rides. Our mission is simple: remove the barriers and let you ride your way. As founder Jason says, \u201cThe thrill of riding should be accessible, safe, and fun for everyone.\u201d Propel delivers exactly that.",
      "Above are real first-time users from our campaign video shoot. We handed them the board, let them ride, and then asked: \u201cHow was it?\u201d This was truly their first time ever riding the product \u2014 no practice runs, no rehearsals. Don\u2019t just take our word for it \u2014 hear what real riders say on their very first ride. \n\nIf you missed it, watch the Propel Foil - Promo Video to see them in action!",
      "Don\u2019t let the size or inflatable design fool you \u2014 Propel boards are engineered for performance, with ultra-light swing weight that makes them incredibly agile and responsive on the water. Thanks to cutting-edge drop-stitch technology, they deliver stiffness, control, and ride feel on par with hard carbon fiber boards, breaking the old stigma that inflatables aren\u2019t high-performance. We\u2019ve pioneered a unique inflatable V-hull, shaped for smooth water release and clean touchdowns, enhanced by a rear water separation edge that reduces drag for more efficient lift.\n\n*Note: Final production boards will include full Propel graphics (not white). See renders below:",
      "Whether you want maximum stability or nimble precision, there\u2019s a perfect board for your style. The Pathfinder is our most stable, beginner-friendly platform, ideal for E-Scooter, E-SUP, Scooter-eFoil, and Jet Kart\u2122 modes \u2014 anyone can hop on and ride comfortably. The Navigator is its agile sibling, blending stability with sharper handling for progressing riders. For pure E-Foil performance, the Glider is our smallest, most responsive board, with concentrated underfoot weight and a feather-light feel, unmatched in agility and control (not recommended for handlebar use). With strategic D-rings, soft silicone handles, and an optimized rocker profile, Propel\u2019s inflatable boards prove you don\u2019t need carbon to perform \u2014 just smart, purposeful design.",
      "With a unique inflatable V-Hull design (for better tracking and smoother directional control) and a reinforced PVC dropstitch hull paired with an EPP foam core + aluminum chassis, this board is engineered for durability and performance. At the rear, an integrated water separation edge reduces suction, letting the board release cleanly from the water for easier lift-offs and touchdowns. Add in the custom EVA deck pad and super-comfy silicone handles, and you get a compact, travel-ready platform that\u2019s both rugged and refined.",
      "Meet QuietJet\u2122 \u2014 our fully enclosed, safe jet propulsion system. With no exposed blades, a low-maintenance design, and ultra-efficient thrust, it delivers smooth, powerful acceleration across all modes while keeping riders, wildlife, and equipment safe. Backed by ~10 kW peak power, CFD-optimized Kort Nozzle engineering, and a whisper-quiet FOC-controlled motor, QuietJet\u2122 offers top speeds up to 25 mph (40 km/h) in eFoil mode and 12 mph (20 km/h) in thruster modes \u2014 with passive water cooling, reverse thrust, and optimized efficiency at ~22 km/h for longer ride times.",
      "Propel\u2019s padded, angle & height adjustable handlebar gives riders extra stability and control, with multiple adjustment points to fit various heights and riding styles. It\u2019s fully removable when you want a free-glide foil experience and mounts tool-free with a secure quick-connect system. With integrated remote placement and tilt-assist steering (for E-SUP and Jet Kart\u2122 modes), it\u2019s designed to make every ride feel smooth, intuitive, and confident.",
      "Propel\u2019s hydrofoil system features a lightweight 6061-T6 aircraft-grade aluminum mast and durable glass-fiber composite wings, delivering balanced performance and durability.

      "Stretch goals are bonus milestones we unlock when the campaign reaches certain funding levels. The more backers we gather, the more awesome extras we can add \u2014 from upgraded accessories to bonus gear to product enhancements. Help us hit these goals by sharing the campaign and spreading the word \u2014 every backer brings us closer to unlocking more for everyone!",
      "Propel began with a simple question: \u201cHow do we bring the freedom and thrill of foiling to everyone?\u201d",
      "Founder Jason Toth, former pro snowboarder (Burton, Volcom, Oakley) and lifelong board sports addict, fell in love with foiling five years ago \u2014 and never looked back. It feels like snowboarding on powder: smooth, weightless, and deeply addictive. A glide that resets your brain and reconnects you to nature. Jason is fluent across all foil disciplines \u2014 prone foiling, wing foiling, para-wing, downwind, wake, tow, and e-foiling \u2014 and has become passionately dedicated to sharing the freedom, thrill, and joy of getting people out on the water and playing.",
      "But when Jason tried to share that joy, he hit the same wall again and again: \u201cIt looks amazing\u2026 but I could never do that.\u201d  Too many boards. Too much setup. Too many barriers.",
      "So he asked: What if one watercraft could carry someone from first glide to full flight \u2014 without making them feel like a beginner?",
      "That spark became a mission. That mission became a system. And that system became Propel:\na 5-in-1 modular watercraft that adapts to the rider \u2014 not the other way around.",
      "Backed by 20+ years of design, manufacturing, and production expertise. We built Propel to be more than fun. We built it to be inviting.",
      "One craft. Five modes.\nNo tools. No confusion. No Stress.\nJust a watercraft that makes everyone say: \u201cI want to ride.\u201d",
      "Jason teamed up with a small but mighty team of engineers and designers who shared his passion. Together, they sketched out a multi-mode watercraft concept and got to work. After over two years of R&D, that idea became the 5-in-1 electric watercraft system we\u2019re introducing today. We built prototype after prototype, testing in oceans, lakes, and pools, refining every detail. We added inflatable elements for stability, plug-and-play connectors for ease, and a jet drive for safety. There were late nights in the workshop and early mornings on the water \u2014 we\u2019ve got the scarred shins and epoxy stains to prove it! But the real proof was when first-time riders hopped on and were gliding within minutes. That\u2019s when we knew we\u2019d created something truly special. This isn\u2019t just a product \u2014 it\u2019s a new way to share the thrill of riding with everyone you love.",
      "To bring Propel to life at the highest quality, we partnered with the best manufacturers in the business. GP87 Inc., led by a former Formula 1 engineer turned CEO MJ. They helped us to refine the hydrodynamics and ensure the design is ready for scaled manufacturing. And surf legend John \u201cBosch\u201d Atkins of Blue Sea Watersports lent his 50+ years of board-shaping expertise to perfect the ride feel and durability. With their help, we\u2019ve taken Propel from a garage project to a production-ready reality. Our prototypes are already conquering waves and turns in real-world tests, and the results are thrilling.",
      "And the Team Behind the Scenes",
      "Propel is backed by a dedicated team of in-house and external experts \u2014 from industrial designers and software engineers to operations specialists and specialized manufacturing partners.",
      "Together, we\u2019ve worked through every detail to bring this innovative 5-in-1 watercraft to life, all driven by one shared goal: delivering an exceptional product to our backers.",
      "We\u2019ve been hands-on from day one \u2014 testing, refining, and obsessing over the experience to ensure it delivers not just performance, but something truly unforgettable.",
      "We\u2019re all in \u2014 and we can\u2019t wait to get this in your hands.",
      "At our core, we\u2019re a team of adventurers and dreamers. We believe time on the water is pure magic \u2014 a blend of freedom, excitement, and Zen all at once. We believe everyone deserves to experience that magic. Our mission is to redefine personal watercraft to make it more inclusive, more versatile, and more fun than ever before. Propel isn\u2019t just another product launch \u2014 it\u2019s the start of a movement to break down barriers in water sports. When you back Propel, you\u2019re joining that mission. You\u2019re helping a small team of passionate builders and riders share the stoke of \u201ceverybody flies\u201d with the world.",
      "We\u2019ve spent the past two years building, testing, and refining every part of Propel \u2014 and now we\u2019re ready to move from prototype to production.",
      "\u2714 Working beta prototypes completed and featured in our campaign videos\n\u2714 Battery, jet drive, and modular systems tested and validated in real-world conditions\n\u2714 Branding and board graphics finalized, with sample units produced\n\u2714 Supplier and manufacturing partnerships secured\n\u2714 Test rides with first-time users, families, and pros \u2014 all delivering overwhelmingly positive feedback (the riders you see in the video were testing for the very first time!)",
      "Next step: As soon as the campaign closes, we lock final tooling and begin production sampling to bring Propel to life for our backers.",
      "We believe transparency is key \u2014 especially when you\u2019re backing a campaign like this. We\u2019ve clocked countless ride sessions on our pre-production units, pushing every part to perform, improve, and impress. From the battery, motor, and ESC to the inflatable chassis, we\u2019ve tested and refined it all through hands-on trials, including:",
      "\u2705 Saltwater exposure and corrosion testing\n\u2705 Drop and impact durability checks\n\u2705 Beginner trials with riders aged 15 to 70\n\u2705 Real-world testing for foil lift, stability, and ride handling",
      "We\u2019re not starting from scratch \u2014 Propel is production-ready, and this campaign is your chance to join early and ride a system that\u2019s already been proven in real-world action.",
      "We\u2019re committed to keeping everything transparent \u2014 including shipping and taxes \u2014 so there are no surprises later. Our goal: deliver safely, affordably, and on time. We\u2019re committed to keeping things transparent, here\u2019s exactly how it works.",
      "Shipping is not included in your pledge. To simplify fulfillment and avoid delays later, we collect a $1,000 shipping deposit at checkout.",
      "Once your Propel is ready to ship, we\u2019ll calculate the actual cost based on your delivery address and chosen method:",
      "Why a deposit? Propel is a large-format, high-value electric watercraft with a lithium battery, Jet Kart\u2122 hull, foil system, inflatable board, and modular parts. Shipping costs can vary significantly by country, season, and fuel prices \u2014 this deposit gives us the flexibility to offer the safest, most cost-efficient delivery method available for your region.",
      "You\u2019ll confirm your shipping details via a post-campaign survey and receive full tracking once your order ships.",
      "Due to the size and value of Propel \u2014 including a large-capacity battery, inflatable boards, foils, jet systems, chassis, and travel gear \u2014 shipping involves three large, heavy packages: one battery (classified as hazardous goods, requiring special handling) and two oversized boxes with the board, foil systems, motors, chassis, and accessories.",
      "While the total door-to-door shipping cost may seem high at first glance, it typically breaks down to about $400 per package depending on destination \u2014 a fair reflection of the size, weight, and special handling required.",
      "We\u2019re actively working to reduce costs by negotiating preferred carrier rates, using bulk container shipments to major continents, and partnering with fulfillment centers for efficient final delivery. While global rates can be unpredictable, we\u2019re fully committed to keeping backer shipping costs as low and fair as possible and will pass along any savings we negotiate..",
      "Propel is a next-generation watercraft \u2014 and like many hardware products, it may be subject to import duties or VAT depending on your country\u2019s regulations.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know:\n\u2714 Tariffs and taxes are not included in your Indiegogo pledge or shipping cost. These charges are collected separately by your country\u2019s customs agency at the time of delivery.\n\u2714 Rates vary by country and may depend on factors such as total value, product classification, and shipping method. Please consult your local import rules for electric recreational equipment.\n\u2714 Special note for USA backers \u2014 We\u2019re monitoring the tariff landscape closely. While current policies are in flux, we believe many restrictions may ease by the time Propel begins shipping in 2026 \u2014 and we\u2019ll explore every possible route to minimize costs for U.S. backers.",
      "We will:\n\u2714 Provide complete commercial invoices and accurate customs documentation.\n\u2714 Work with fulfillment partners to minimize delays and optimize HS code classification.\n\u2714 Notify you of any known tariffs before shipping, so you\u2019re not caught off guard.\n\u2714 If you have questions about how duties might apply in your country, feel free to contact our team \u2014 we\u2019re happy to help you navigate it!",
      "Will I be able to track my shipment?\nYes \u2014 all shipments include full tracking and insurance.",
      "How are units shipped?\nWe partner with international logistics providers experienced in handling lithium batteries and watercraft equipment. Your Propel will arrive in a secure, foam-protected carton or hard case depending on your order tier.",
      "What if I live in a remote area?\nWe\u2019ll work with our partners to get your order to you. Remote delivery surcharges may apply, and we\u2019ll notify you during the final address confirmation process.",
      "Estimated Delivery\nBacker shipments begin in late spring 2026, fulfilled in waves based on tier and order date. You\u2019ll receive updates throughout the process \u2014 from production to final delivery. We fully believe in the mantra: under-promise and over-deliver \u2014 and we\u2019ll do everything we can to get your order out even earlier if possible!",
      "Imagine: one board, five thrilling ways to ride \u2014 and everything you need included.",
      "We\u2019re on a mission to change the way people experience water adventures, and we can\u2019t do it without you. Propel Foil isn\u2019t just another gadget \u2014 it\u2019s your ticket to endless fun, new challenges, and unforgettable moments shared with the people you love.",
      "We\u2019ve done the work: built the prototypes, tested every ride mode, and assembled an incredible team. Now, the final \u2014 and most important \u2014 piece is you.",

      "Although the history of the toilet brush is more than 2000 years old, not much has changed in our modern, civilized world.",
      "This patented invention is a much more hygienic toilet cleaning device than the conventional toilet brush or silicone brush. CLOOUBRUSH only works with water pressure and enables thorough and hygienic cleaning under and over water without bristles and contamination. In addition, this invention does not require a collecting container (brush holder), as is familiar from toilet brushes. Dirt and grime therefore no longer collect in unhygienic toilet brush containers. In addition, CLOOUBRUSH is made of dirt and water-repellent recycled plastic, which also prevents dirt and grime from sticking. Thanks to its efficiency and sustainable concept, you reduce your cleaning agent costs and water consumption enormously and make a major contribution to environmental protection. Our promise: CLOOUBRUSH still looks like it did on the first day, even after decades.",
      "Hygiene comes first:",
      "The innovative solution was developed with the highest hygiene standards in mind. CLOOUBRUSH leaves a flawless toilet.",
      "Here are some reasons why CLOOUBRUSH is the best choice for your bathroom.",
      "Here you can see toilet brushes that have been rated 4 stars or more. That's how much you pay for toilet brushes that you then have to throw away and replace again and again because they smell too strong, have become unsightly and unhygienic. This not only puts a strain on your own wallet, but also on our much more valuable environment.",
      "Test with the prototype",
      "No tedious, unhygienic scrubbing and smearing dirt back and forth. CLOOUBRUSH uses state-of-the-art technology to clean your toilet thoroughly and hygienically - without the use of bristles and harsh chemical.",
      "When using conventional brushes, it is not uncommon to find paper residue from the previous user in the brush head. The brush is often taken out of a container in which water with lots of dirt has collected. Before the brush reaches the toilet bowl for cleaning, a few drops usually fall onto the toilet rim or the floor, creating a hotbed of danger.",
      "This is no longer appropriate in the 21st century.",
      "The revolutionary toilet cleaning solution was developed to make life easier and more hygienic. CLOOUBRUSH does not require a brush holder, so absolutely no disgusting liquids can accumulate and disgust and bad odors are a thing of the past.",
      "CLOOUBRUSH VS. SILICONE TOILET BRUSH  +  CONVENTIONAL TOILET BRUSH",
      "Forget annoying dripping and messy handling. The innovative design ensures that the product does not come into contact with faeces. No more dripping dirty, smelly water on the toilet seat and floor. No more contact with dirt, faeces and paper waste.",
      "Effective under and over water and in hard-to-reach places.",
      "CLOOUBRUSH is just as effective under water as it is above water. Cleans in hard-to-reach places and also removes limescale, urine scale, dirt and grease under water with every use.",
      "Here is a tough demonstration compared to a conventional toilet brush with ketchup, curry, mayonnaise. urine scale, limescale and deep cleaning automatically after every visit to the toilet, thanks to the fragrant, environmentally friendly 3-in-one cleaning stone. And best of all: biodegradable.",
      "The result: CLOOUBRUSH cleans two toilet bowls in the same time, where a toilet brush can only manage one.",
      "Not only can you connect CLOOUBRUSH to your standing toilet or wall-mounted toilet, but you can also simply unscrew the CLOOUBRUSH and screw it onto your shower hose or bathtub hose. This means you can clean your joints or wall and floor tiles throughout the bathroom and remove dirt and limescale.",
      "The all-rounder cleans your entire bathroom effortlessly. CLOOUBRUSH can be easily attached to your existing shower hose or bathtub hose in no time at all.",
      "effortless cleaning of bathroom tiles",
      "Cleaning under the toilet rim, demonstration with a colored adhesive material.",
      "Self-cleaning by simply holding under running water, thanks to dirt and water-repellent materials.",
      "Our product range includes a selection of environmentally friendly cleaning products that are perfectly adapted for use with our appliances. These cleaning agents are  biodegradable and do not harm the environment.",
      "3 in one cleaning stones.",
      "dissolves limescale, urinescale and has aromatic fragrance,  is biodegradable.",
      "Personalize your cleaning experience with optional fragrance and cleaning stones that have a effect for up to a month. Enjoy a pleasant atmosphere while ensuring an exemplary and, above all, clean toilet for you and your loved ones without harming the environment.",
      "Adjust the cleaning intensity to your needs. CLOOUBRUSH has a pressure regulator that allows you to choose between a gentle clean (over water) and a thorough deep clean (under water).",
      "Refilling the cleaning stone is very easy. CLOOUBRUSH is easy to open and to close again. Choose from a range of fragrant cleaning agents and fragrances to customize the cleaning and fragrance experience to your personal preferences.",
      "The intuitive operation of the product makes it easy to use for people of all ages. From children to seniors, the user-friendly operation ensures hassle-free cleaning without complicated steps.",
      "The design makes it a breeze to use. With its comfortable handle, it sits comfortably in the hand and enables effortless cleaning in every corner of the toilet.",
      "The shape also makes it ideal for people with limited mobility.",
      "CLOOUBRUSH is made from materials that are designed for long-term use. The robust housing and precise workmanship guarantee many years of reliable use and still shine as brightly as on the first day, even after years of use.",
      "Make a statement for the environment and reduce plastic waste. CLOOUBRUSH is made from high-quality, durable recycled materials that guarantee long-term use while minimizing the consumption of single-use products.",
      "CLOOUBRUSH is made of dirt and water-repellent materials. The splashing and dripping of water and faeces/urine mixture on the floor and toilet seat, which often occurs with conventional brushes, is now a thing of the past. CLOOUBRUSH ensures an even distribution of the cleaning solution without unsightly splashes.",
      "According to the German Federal Institute for Population Research, there are around 196 million private households in the EU alone and 106 million private households in the USA, in which a total of around 780 million people live.  Based on these 302 million households, which should dispose of the brush set every 6 months, an annual plastic waste - calculated with an average of 200 grams - of an incredible 120.800 tons is produced (mind you, only in the USA and the EU). This corresponds to 6040 fully loaded trucks, in the form of plastic pellets. This does not include hospitals, schools and other public facilities, including restaurants. This rough calculation does not even include the packaging material and the generation of CO2 and particulate matter during delivery. You can now imagine how much plastic waste is created by the inefficiency of conventional toilet brushes/silicone brushes and the resulting \"need\" for more cleaning products and even more plastic waste and waste of our global water resources.",
      "Good news for you: You can save the continuous cost of replacing brush sets, CLOOUBRUSH will be your hygienic and most importantly cost-effective helper for many years to come.",
      "Good news for the environment: 120800 tons of plastic waste and the resulting CO2 and particulate matter in the U.S. and EU alone can be avoided.",
      "Facts: Sad but true, 6040 trucks lined up in a row make a distance of 70 miles/113 kilometers, all polluting the environment with CO2 and particulate matter.",
      "Toilet brushes lined up in a row with (average 40 cm) which are only disposed of in the U.S.A. and the EU annually, would result in a distance of more than 3 times the distance to the moon and back.",
      "Most people flush the toilet twice, the first time to prevent the conventional toilet brush from being contaminated more than necessary by wet toilet paper that gets \"tangled\" in the bristles and by human excrement. The second flush is carried out to remove the residue. This means that CLOOUBRUSH can reduce water consumption in the toilet by 50%.",
      "Good news for you: you can do without the second flush. This means that you save an average of 10 liters of fresh water and 10 liters of waste water with every flush. So with just one flush per person per day, you would save 3650 liters of fresh water and 3650 liters of waste water per year (waste water is generally more expensive than fresh water).",
      "Good news for the environment: With 780 million people in the USA and the EU, this currently means a potential saving of 2.847.000.000.000 liters of fresh water and 2.847.000.000.000 liters of waste water (assuming one toilet flush per person per day per year).",
      "Facts: Sad but true, 2.847.000.000.000 liters of water is equivalent to half of Lake Michigan in the USA, 6 times as much as Eriesee Lake in the USA/Canada, or 60 times as much as Bodensee Lake, spanning 3 countries: Germany/Switzerland/Austria.",
      "Thanks to the advanced conical design, water is also used more efficiently inside the CLOOUBRUSH, while cleaning performance is maximized and water consumption is minimized. This not only reduces water consumption, but also saves money on the water bill.",
      "CLOOUBRUSH uses an average of just 50 ml of water per toilet visit.",
      "Conventional cleaning with a traditional toilet brush usually involves using large quantities of cleaning agents to \"try\" to reach as many areas as possible under the toilet rim and in the toilet bowl above and especially under water. This is because this is where urine scale, limescale, tend to accumulate. In contrast, CLOOUBRUSH only works with the efficiently used water pressure, making the use of urine scale and limescale remover in large quantities completely unnecessary. If required, a fragrance and cleaning agent can be added to the mixing chamber inside the cleaning rod, which is biodegradable and environmentally friendly. CLOOUBRUSH saves you money in the long term compared to conventional methods, as you need fewer cleaning agents (scouring powder, hang-on scented stones, urine scale remover, limescale remover). The exact dosage guarantees optimum use of cleaning agents without wastage.",
      "Good news for you: you can save yourself the constant expense and disgust of cleaning the brush set and toilet because CLOOUBRUSH does not require any cleaning agents at all thanks to the efficient use of water pressure. This means that you save money every time you clean by simply dispensing with cleaning agents. CLOOUBRUSH cleans your toilet cost-effectively and to the highest standard, even without cleaning agents.",
      "Good news for the environment: once again, this means a huge potential saving of tons of plastic waste and in some cases tons of aggressive chemicals for the USA and the EU alone, if you only consider the 780 million people who live there.",
      "The advantages of CLOOUBRUSH at a glance",
      "1. Fewer cleaning agents (scouring powder, fragrances, urine scale remover), which is good for the environment and your wallet.",
      "2. No need to constantly replace the toilet brush and holder. Protects the environment and saves you money.",
      "3. 50% saving on fresh water (water wastage) by eliminating the second flush. Protects the environment and saves you money.",
      "4. 50% saving on waste water (waste water costs are usually higher than fresh water costs). Protects the environment and saves you money.",
      "So not only are you doing something good for your hygiene and your wallet, you are also doing something good for our environment and conserving our resources.",
      "The good part: the investment pays for itself quickly thanks to the savings.",
      "In highway toilets, hospitals and many other public facilities, it is now common practice for the toilet seat to be completely cleaned after every visit to the toilet. Touch-free taps, soap dispensers with sensors and electronic hand dryers can be found here. The light also switches on automatically via motion detectors; only the toilet brush is still in a corner that nobody really wants to come into contact with.",
      "Modern design for every bathroom.",
      "The sleek and elegant design of the product makes it a modern addition to any bathroom d\u00e9cor. It blends seamlessly into different styles and adds an appealing aesthetic to the room.",
      "Installation video (Standing-WC)",
      "Installation video (Pre-wall WC)",
      "The installation of the product is very simple. Follow the clear instructions to effortlessly attach the product to your toilet. It can be installed on a pre-wall toilet as well as on a floor-standing toilet, caravan or boat.",
      "Your safety is our top priority. CLOOUBRUSH has been developed according to the strictest safety standards and tested for two years to ensure a reliable and safe cleaning solution for your home.",

      "Innovative gift idea: Surprise your family or friends with a gift that is not only practical but also innovative. CLOOUBRUSH is a unique gift idea that will bring enthusiasm and joy to every household.",

    "company_name": "Tinipak",
    "allParagraphs": [
      "Safety features and a personalized design, all in a modular streamlined bag are weighing 660 grams.",
      "I\u2019m Hoang - a father of two children. When one of them started primary school, I was confused about choosing a suitable backpack. Most of the backpacks that I saw were flashy, bulky, and failed to meet my expectations for a school backpack. I also felt they put my kid at risk of falling by being off-balance. Besides, bringing an extremely heavy backpack to school every day could cause many back issues for kids, such as back pain. Since collecting and working with backpacks has been my passion for such a long time, I had a desire to design a capable backpack for my little son. This was the powerful motivator for me to make my dream come true.",
      "After extensive research, I noticed that to reduce back pain, the weight of backpacks should account for 5-7% of a kid\u2019s body weight. However, a light backpack is insufficient to keep them protected from the books in their backpack, which easily bumps into their back when moving around and causes pain.",
      "Hence, after two years of development, the first Tinipak version was born. It was called TiniBox, with a mission to help kids \u201cfly to school.\u201d Tinipak is the lightest ergonomic backpack and at the forefront of personalized and flexible design - with easy to attach accessories.",
      "The prominent zippers on minimal pattern create a modern and unique look for Tinipak and highlight the Paker - a compelling feature to show kid\u2019s personalities. Tinipak has 3 Simplicity colors available with the personalized packers collection.",
      "We combined student-friendly features with a gender-neutral style to create a Tinipak backpack.",
      "Paker is a collection of patches designed by Tinipak. Paker can be changed for different special occasions, making it superior to other backpacks' fixed and boring stickers.",
      "Paker has been made for the global version and updated continually.",
      "Each of our products (TiniBox, TiniPenbox, and TiniPencilbox) included a Paker. Paker will be distributed at the end of the campaign.",
      "Tinipak has chosen magnetic locks that are easier for little hands. The convenient magnetic chest strap helps to keep the shoulder straps from slipping off kids' little shoulders, letting them free to run and jump.",
      "The innovative magnetic buckle is attached directly to one strap without webbing, enabling easy one-handed attachment/detachment.",
      "Modular with TiniFile: The power of organization with 11 compartments keeps school supplies separated and clean, with quick access and easy storage.",
      "TiniBox can be used for kids who want to organize books in a large space, or it can be more organized with TiniFile, where books and papers are divided into three vertical compartments for children who need to be careful and tidy.",
      "Tinipak found that wearing ID cards around the neck is very inconvenient and annoying for children because they are so active. To facilitate the most comfortable experience for children at school every day, Tinipak designed TiniCard for the global version.",
      "TiniBox is designed with a thick back panel and ergonomic prototype frame, keeping kids safe from back pain caused by backpacks. Tinipak leads the market with lightweight, ergonomic backpacks for kids and focuses on maximizing innovative features for kids at school. A sternum strap prevents the straps from sliding off kids\u2019 shoulders while they inevitably run and jump around with their backpacks on.",
      "With TiniFile, books are close to your back, which avoids distributing the force that causes back pain.",
      "In poor lighting conditions like early morning, in the rain, or in the dark, the reflective lines in front of the TiniBox and on the two straps are highly visible to any traffic, which helps avoid accidents.",
      "It is common for kids to take regular public transit (vs. a dedicated school bus) to school, so they need a transit card and some cash on the way. They may also be required to have their name tag/ID showing (e.g., a lanyard around their neck in school). TiniCard is designed to streamline both of these student needs.",
      "Other backpacks on the market cannot achieve any functionality to facilitate a quick and easy experience. Tinipak, with a modular design, helps kids feel more comfortable when they bring it to school.",
      "Other backpacks have traditional pen cases, which are inconvenient: Everything is floating around in space. It can be disruptive for students when they try to find what they need. Moreover, it is hard to consider which one might be missing, a part of why kids forget their stuff.",
      "TiniPenbox is designed to keep the stuff that goes to school neat, convenient, and organized with your kids.",
      "Tinipak keeps students from forgetting or losing their belongings, as all items are organized.",
      "All stuff designed by Tinipak: We focus on the convenience of the product and the detail of items, like the more extensive and bolder digit to help kids easily see numbers.",
      "We chose materials to meet the following criteria: lightweight, durable, and convenient for children to use.",
      "Our product is mainly designed for kids. However, according to the many positive feedbacks we've received, Tinipak has been enjoyed by many adults as well. Our product would be perfect for those who are under 5\u201911\u2019\u2019. You can read the review from Pangolins- a team of backpack geeks, for further information. So if you are a grown-up and considering owning one, let\u2019s give it a try. We believe that it won\u2019t make you disappointed!",
      "We have spent the last two years researching the design and materials to create a backpack. It took us 18 months of failures to design a beautiful product on paper that was too difficult to build in practice. However, from this first lesson, we gained a lot of experience and knowledge to make Tinipak\u2019s first product.",
      "We comprehend our target users and their context of use, and we can determine their demands. We try to meet their needs, providing them a comfortable experience, which lets them focus on learning.",
      "The design process is an iterative process that involves sketches, 3D design, mockups, trying on models, and sewing on the sample fabrics. For each version, we evaluated the users\u2019 context and requirements to check the design's performance and then tried to match the users\u2019 specific context and satisfy all of their relevant needs. For this, I observed my son's usage context and behavior for quite a long time and then tried to identify and address the limitation for each version.",
      "The best product has to be perfect in every detail. An example of this is designing a durable zipper head that is easy for children's small hands to hold and pull. Being a small start-up like Tinipak, we were so glad to convince YKK, the no.1 zipper brand globally, to become our partner.",
      "For the development of Paker, after researching many partners around the world, we are proud to have chosen in-house production of all Paker, so we, Vietnamese, make them. We printed on different materials to achieve the perfect finish and retain the most vibrant colors for more children's enjoyment.",
      "From Osprey, The North Face, Jack Wolfskin, Samsonite, and the newer, creative brand names such as Peak Design and Nomatic, we found that the next generation of backpacks is becoming more innovative and convenient, providing a better experience for users.",
      "Historically, the backpack was created during wars, when soldiers had to carry large amounts of equipment into battle. Afterwards, it became more widely used in daily life. However, we realized that their features were not optimal, especially for primary/elementary school life. Children with small shoulders wear backpacks every day; however, few brands have yet to design anything for them. We realized that we needed to redefine school backpacks, and with that, Tinipak was born. Our goal is to help students go to school more comfortably and conveniently.",
      "Tinipak's first version was launched in Vietnam in August 2020. It gained a considerable number of compliments from Vietnamese residents and foreign followers. We appreciated the suggestions and feedback from the first followers, which allowed us to perfect this version to launch on Kickstarter and bring this dream to the world.",
      "Over the years, with diligence and craftsmanship, Vietnam has produced many products for leading brands globally. However, Vietnam doesn\u2019t yet have a world-recognized brand, and we feel that we have a mission to make one.",
      "To build a well-known brand, besides excellent manufacturing, it is necessary to develop an industrial design. Thousands of Vietnamese students in this field have graduated, but there is no place to build their skills, and they work in different jobs. For this reason, we would love to promote this industry in our country.",
      "After a minor scale release in Vietnam, we hope that the global community will support our campaign. This can motivate us to build a team, a company, and a pretty new profession in Vietnam. Your support also helps us focus on creating, designing, and manufacturing high-quality backpack brands and solving problems with intelligent, handy solutions.",
      "We have spent over two years - such a long journey to be here. If Tinipak brings real value to you, please support us and share Tinipak with everyone.",
      "We can't do this without you.",
      "Suppose our shipping carrier attempts delivery to you and the package returns to our warehouse (either because you're not there, the wrong address was provided, or you moved without telling us). In that case, it will be the buyer's responsibility to pay the shipping fee to reship the order. When you receive your tracking number, please keep an eye out for the package.",
      "Backers from all other countries (apart from the United States) may have to pay additional import duties or other applicable taxes to the concerned authorities upon receipt of their goods - depending on the import policies of their respective countries.

    "allParagraphs": [
      "Award-winning device, extending all your portable electronics' battery lifespan by as much as 50%.",
      "And fast-charging and overnight charging also shorten battery lifespan.",
      "A battery that is charged to 100% is under high chemical stress, which increases battery wear. Fast charging not only accelerates this wear but also raises the battery's temperature, which is even more harmful to its long-term lifespan. And with overnight charging these batteries stay under high chemical stress for hours\u2026 Besides, why would you want to charge fast if you have 7 or more hours to charge your battery overnight?",
      "Lithium-ion batteries power our world, but their gradual wear forces us to replace our 'old' devices more frequently. Shockingly, a quarter of all devices end up in the trash simply because their batteries have worn out. This not only hurts our wallet, but also leads to mountains (literally) of e-waste, which is a significant environmental concern. On top of this, dealing with batteries dying on us throughout the day becomes a recurring inconvenience.",
      "Plugged between your charger and device, Leo first analyzes your battery and then automatically sets an optimal charge limit, regulates charging speeds, and schedules timely breaks to keep your batteries healthy for years.",
      "(see FAQ for sources and more information)",
      "It is this combination of features that makes Leo so effective in improving the lifespan of your batteries:",
      "Leo automatically sets an optimal charge limit at approximately 90% for all your USB devices. Maintaining your batteries within the range of 10% to 90% can already significantly extend their lifespan.",
      "(While Samsung phones include this feature by default, it's a rarity among smart devices and nearly nonexistent among non-smart ones. To see how Leo's capabilities stack up against other devices, refer to the comparison lower on this page.)",
      "Leo charges at a slower, more sustainable rate when you have the time, such as during the night. However, with a simple push of a button, you can switch to fast charging when needed!",
      "During night charging, Leo takes a break at around 80%, effectively reducing the duration your batteries remain at a high charge percentage and voltage.",
      "(iPhones use the same trick at night, but they do not offer a charge limit and will still charge to 100% eventually)",
      "Leo works just by plugging it in between your device and your charger: Plug&Play. You do not have to do anything yourself. Even one of our team members' grandmothers is using a prototype of Leo, and she just turned 87!",
      "Leo can be used to optimize charging for practically all your USB-C devices. Whether your device uses a USB-C to lightning cable or a USB-A to USB-C cable, they can still benefit from Leo. Its adaptability enables implementation on both the charger side and the device side.",
      "As mentioned earlier, you can still opt for a fast charge up to 100% when necessary. Simply hold the button to swiftly override Leo and switch to fast charging. This way, there's no need to unplug Leo.",
      "Leo is designed with sustainability in mind. Our device is built to last for many years, and with updatable software, it will stay up to date throughout its lifespan. We've made the cable modular and easily replaceable to ensure longevity, as we understand that even the best cables can wear out over time.",
      "You don\u2019t need an app or anything to make Leo work: just plug it in. But if you like extra features: here we go. With the Leo App, you get a dashboard with battery analytics, you can measure battery health, see charging graphs, and keep Leo up to date with OTA firmware updates! We will continue adding new features through the app and Leo.",
      "How? Let\u2019s say you own 3 rechargeable portable electronic devices:",
      "Average smartphone: ~$823\n3 other devices (headphones, smart watch, tablet, mouse, keyboard, speakers, go-pro, etc): ~$450\nTotal: ~$1273\n\nIf you would be able to improve the lifespan of these devices by just 5% (representing a value of ~$64) Leo would already earn back its value, as Leo is priced at ~$59 on Kickstarter. The expected improved lifespan actually reaches as much as 50%, which would mean a 10x return on investment within the current lifecycle of your devices.",
      "Lab results actually show as much as a 63% lifespan increase, but as we aspire to underpromise and overdeliver we assume a lifespan increase of as much as 50%.",
      "After a year of continuously cycling dozens of batteries using different protocols of Leo, our results were unanimous. Across all the protocols we examined, we consistently observed a substantial extension in battery lifespan, reaching up to an impressive 63%. The actual degree of battery life extension largely depends on the user's existing efforts to mitigate battery degradation.",
      "The experiments were done with AccuBattery installed, in order to externally validate our findings. With over 10 million downloads, this trusted battery analytics app showcases an example of the tangible impact of Leo on battery longevity.",
      "To learn more about the science behind Leo and optimal battery charging, go to our FAQ page.",
      "Our journey began approximately 3 years ago as part of an MS Physics literature study on battery degradation mechanisms. We then started running the first tests.",
      "In the renowned Demonstrator Lab at the Vrije University in Amsterdam, we converted our ideas into an actual first prototype. With this prototype, we started testing the effectiveness of our protocols both in the lab (see our technical validation section), as well as testing with our first beta testers.",
      "Next step: implement all of our learnings and beta tester feedback. Brainstorming, sketching, 3D printing, and testing everything we could think of.",

    "description": "Tiny, light, versatile with long working distance, compatible with any phone camera and affordable.",
    "company_name": "QingYing E&T LLC",
    "allParagraphs": [
      "Tiny, light, versatile with long working distance, compatible with any phone camera and affordable.",
      "Since Antony van Leeuwenhoek invented his microscope in 17th century, there has been great progress in microscope technology. Microscopes with excellent performance usually are bulky, heavy and expensive, even for portable ones. Last year, together with our 4398 backers, we made a huge success on portable microscopy with our first fingertip microscope. Now we glad to introduce a new model of our fingertip microscope - iMicro C. It has simpler design, larger view field, lower cost and more importantly a longer working distance so it is versatile for observing different objects. It is so tiny that it adds almost nothing on your phone but enables you to carry a microscopic tool with you as easily as you carry your phone. In addition, all the items packed in a thin PP case can be easily fit into wallet.",
      "This video is a demonstration of the long working distance of iMicro C so you can see many interesting things for fun.  What in the video is small snails in a aquarium, seen with iMicro C through the glass wall of the  aquarium.",
      "Different from our first fingertip microscope (iMicro Q), iMicro C has been designed with relative low magnification power, so it has a larger field of view of about 5mm so that it is very good to observe some \"large\" micro-objects, such as small insects and tiny mechanical/electronic parts.",
      "Different from iMicro Q with very high magnification power and very short working distance, iMicro C has a long working distance of about ~4mm. So it can be used to observe objects that iMicro Q can not access to, such as SMT parts on PCB, defects inside of a crystal and something behind glass window. As shown it is snail eggs on the inner surface of a aquarium, shot through glass wall of the aquarium.",
      "It is also easy to obtain clear image, as it has larger DOF (depth of field). Roughly a 0.5mm DOF was obtained on the tilted ruler at 45 degree.",
      "The USAF 1951 resolution test chart (defined by the U.S. Air Force MIL-STD-150A standard of 1951) was used to test the resolution of iMicro C on an iPhone 7. It can distinguish the finest pattern of group 6 (4.38 micron). This is really excellent provided its relative low magnification.",
      "Smartphone microscope is different from comprehensive desktop microscope, it is not able to introduce bulk and expensive focus tuning system. But we find alternative solution for focusing and easy operation. A focus ring can be used to assist focus to obtain clear image easily. Also when not using focus ring, it is best practice to put phone against a desktop surface and tilt it to adjust focus with increased stability.",
      "The microscope itself is only 12 mm (1/2 inch) and weighs only 0.5 gram (1/60 oz). All the parts are packed in a thin case of the size a credit card with only 5mm thickness.",
      "iMicro C will be coupled with your smartphone by nano-pad. It is designed to work with any phone with camera. No matter for phones with single back camera or multiple back camera, with a flat camera(s) or extruded camera(s), We have not yet found exception. Please see the picture for your reference to see how it looks with different camera configuration.",
      "Traditional desktop microscope is very expensive, while fingertip microsocpe is affordable for every one. We want every child can have a microscope to explore the world.",
      "For traditional compound microscopes, the magnification mainly relies on its complex optical system, which includes objective and eyepiece. Its magnification is a combination of the magnification of objective and eyepiece.",
      "For our fingertip microscope, three stages of magnification are combined together to achieve the total magnification. First, the lens provides optical magnification to generate the image on the smartphone camera's sensor; second, the image on the sensor is displayed on the much larger screen via the electronic process and magnification; third, digital zoom provides further magnification as a digital magnification to the image. The total magnification is a combination of these three.",
      "Therefore, iMicro C uses a different process and technology compared to a traditional microscope. Thanks to the advance of micro-optics and smartphone technology, with the effort and expertise accumulated in the past years, we have enabled iMicro C to achieve excellent performance at a low cost.",
      "We walked a long path for the development of smartphone based microscopic tools since the first patent in 2012. We have already successfully built a series of smartphone microscope product including iMICROSCOPE, iMICROSCOPE R and the \u03bcRuler as well as the first fingertip microscope iMicro Q.",
      "Based on these successfully projects, we shaped the initial idea of Fingertip microscope and polished it according to the great support and comments from our backers and customers. We optimized The optics as well as the design and each step was proofed with prototype to achieve the best performance.",
      "The final finished version has a structure that uses a flexible transparent focusing ring which can be installed and removed on the diffusing ring, as shown in the figure.",
      "The lens is the key component of the system. A small ball lens (van Leeuwenhoek) is a simple approach. But it is well known to suffer from a very limited usable field of view due to severe field curvature effects as well as spherical and other aberrations. iMicro C uses aspherical lens with a dedicated design, to achieve its high optical performance.",
      "Different from conventional adhesive, the nano suction pad mimics gecko's foot-pads, it has thousands of micro air pockets functioning like micro suction cups to hold the device to the phone. Every time it is applied and removed it leaves nothing on the phone. This newly developed \"nano suction pad\" is residue-free, non-tacky and repeatable. The use of nano-suction pad has been proofed in our previous product and it is repeatable and easily be cleaned by a PSA tape.",
      "Every smartphone now has an auto-focus function. When iMicro C is coupled with smartphone, this automatic focus function also works. When you point the lens at an object and get it within proper working distance, the phone will automatically focus to obtain a clear image.",
      "A high quality \u03bcRuler (stage micrometer) will be provided (as an option) with iMicro C to calibrate the scale-bar in APP and measure size. Please see our previous campaign \u03bcRuler - A micro-Ruler to measure the micro objects for more information.",
      "It is important to keep a scale-bar and ensure its accuracy on a micrograph. The dedicated APP i-Seeing was designed to take micrographs to meet professional demand. The scale-bar on the micrograph could be toggled on/off to let you embed a scale-bar on the image if you\u2019d like.",
      "As the iMicro C has a longer working distance, it is able to use ambient or artificial light to illuminate the objects, also the flash light is easy as the addition of a light source. So there are more options and the flexibility to control the light to obtain the desired effect.",
      "The iMicro C has been designed to be simple for everyone to use. No complex knobs and adjustment: just align it with phone's camera, attach it to the phone and then point at the sample or any interesting things you would like to see.",
      "You may see more details of iMicro Q here: https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/imicro-add-an-800x-microscope-to-your-phone/",
      "We are a group of microscopy enthusiasts and experts who aim to provide new microscope tools for you to enjoy microscopic photography and explore the micro-world. We have put our effort into this area for quite a few years and got several patents authorized since April of 2012. After putting such a lot of effort into to developing iMicro, we want to control its cost and make it affordable to everyone. Mass production is very important to be able to control the cost, so we need your support to start our first mass production run.",
      "We\u2019d love it if you could tell your friends, family, and the rest of the world about Fingertip microscope.",
      "Please join our Facebook fingertip microscope group, there many fingertip microscope users and lovers share pictures and experiences with lot of discussions.",

      "A: We have tested on many type of drains around the world. We can\u2019t guarantee 100% match, but 99% of the drain will work: there is always some drain design with specific purpose, and those are the one we are not sure of.",
      "How long will the PressDrain last?",
      "A: With the idea of design to last, every part of PressDrain is tough enough to last for years. If you want a specific number, we will say it will last for 2 year.",
      "Will I hurt my self from using PressDrain?",
      "A: The blade is not sharpened, the blade is more like scissors, only the wedges is hardened.",
      "Will my kids hurt themselves with PressDrain?",
      "A: Like we said on the page, blades are hidden inside the base, your finger will not reach the blades.",
      "Also, we have childproof design, it is not easy to separate two parts, preventing kids from taking it apart and play with the metal part.",
      "Last but not least, you can always twist it to close the drain, turn into stopper.",
      "PressDrain can catch jewelry, but what if I drop something in?",
      "A: PressDrain is fitted with metal part in the base, it will largely increase the difficulty for small item to fall through. Then you can easily take your small item out.",
      "So I just press it to cut hair, how many times I will need to press/step if I feel water flow turn slow?",
      "A: Depending on the amount of hair tangled in the base, a few presses until the water flow again. Like we demonstrated in the page.",
      "Can I cancel the pledge, or can I get a refund after the campaign?",
      "A: No, while you can cancel your pledge before the campaign ends, we do not offer refunds once the campaign ends as we need the fund to produce our units. We appreciate your understanding of our policy and your support.",

      "We have analyzed the existing products on the market. The existing fans on the market mainly include the following categories of products:\n1. Traditional handheld fans: small size, portable, but limited wind power, low wind speed, cannot meet large-scale cleaning needs.\n2. Multifunctional cleaning fans: strong wind power, covering many scenes, but large size, difficult to operate.\n3. High-power industrial fans: strong wind speed, long endurance, but expensive and noisy.\n4. Intelligent adjustable fans: more intelligent, humanized, suitable for multiple scenes, moderately priced, but complicated to operate.\nSummary: The existing products on the market have certain deficiencies in function. Booster Turbo Fan combines the advantages of various products and avoids their respective shortcomings to a certain extent. It is an innovative product.",
      "By chance, by observing the blades of modern drones, we innovatively applied the drone ducted power group to the fan for the first time. We used 11 ducted blades designed independently and matched them with a 50,000r/min high-speed brushless aviation motor. The wind speed can be accelerated to 55m/s and the continuous thrust can reach 1400g.",
      "When we were doing market research, we found that there were certain safety issues with the products on the market, so we included this part in our design scope. Finally, after multiple rounds of safety tests, we made a relatively satisfactory design.",
      "Finally, after our continuous discussion and testing, we finalized the final version, which combines the advantages of current market products and makes up for the shortcomings of current market products to a certain extent. It is an innovative product. At the same time, we named it Booster TF64 A1 after our company.",
      "He can adapt to various scenarios and help you complete various tasks. He will become a powerful assistant in your life.",
      "Booster TF64 A1 uses a motor with a maximum power of 750 watts and a maximum wind speed of 55 meters per second, making you feel like you are holding a tornado in your hand.",
      "We equipped it with 8 10C kinetic batteries with a total capacity of up to 4000mAh and a maximum battery life of up to 80 minutes. While enjoying high wind speeds, it also has ultra-long battery life, giving you plenty of time to complete your work.",
      "The detailed front LED lighting design makes everything visible, so you can use it even at night to enjoy the lighting and coolness at the same time.",
      "For its core, the brushless motor, we use the best cooling technology available today, so that you can enjoy the huge wind force brought by the Turbo Fan for a long time while the core temperature of the motor remains relatively stable. You don\u2019t need to worry about the motor overheating, and you can use it with confidence.",
      "This video will give you a detailed introduction on how to use this product and what scenarios in life it is suitable for.",
      "Why choose Booster instead of ordinary brands? First, because our design is better, we use 64MM ducted air outlet. Second, we have 1400g super thrust, while ordinary brands generally have thrust of 200 to 300g. Third, we use super-long battery life, with a maximum battery life of 80 minutes, while ordinary brands have a battery life of 20 minutes. Fourth, we use brushless motors, while ordinary brands use brushed motors.",
      "We have also adjusted our products for different regions and countries around the world to ensure that they meet the standards of different countries so that every customer can use our products.

      "Check out the chart below to find out why the Freewell Magnetic VND Filter Kit is absolutely one of a kind!",

And chances are, while you're reading this, some of yours are working overtime\u2014shoulders up to your ears, neck stiff, maybe even a clenched jaw? Sound familiar? It's all thanks to fascia, the connective tissue that holds everything in place. Over time, repetitive motions, stress, and sitting too long (hello, desk life) cause both muscles and fascia to tighten up, leading to that all-too-familiar stiffness.",
      "Not only does the OBT release muscle tension and stubborn knots, but it also loosens tight fascia, improving circulation, flexibility, and easing migraines and tension headaches. We\u2019ve got your back\u2014along with your neck, shoulders, and everything in between ?. The result? You\u2019ll feel restored, revitalized, and more at ease with your body\u2728",
      "The OBT is available in two elemental material options: natural Jade gemstone and hypoallergenic Zamak alloy, both offering durability and therapeutic benefits. Each feature of the OBT is thoughtfully crafted to target specific muscle groups and pressure points, providing relief and recovery from the tension of everyday life ?.",
      "The Orijin Body Tool, made from Zamak alloy, is ideal for hot and cold therapy due to its high thermal conductivity. For cold therapy simply submerge the OBT in ice water for 3-5 minutes (32\u00b0F/0\u00b0C), or for hot therapy, place the OBT in warm water (100\u00b0F-110\u00b0F/37.8\u00b0C-43.3\u00b0C) for 3-5 minutes. This allows the OBT to absorb and retain the temperature, providing soothing relief for muscle tension, headaches/migraines,  inflammation, and soreness.",
      "The Orijin Body Tool sets itself apart by merging ancient techniques with modern design. Rooted in tradition and crafted with a sleek aesthetic, it\u2019s both functional and visually striking. Made from high-quality Zamak alloy and Jade, it effectively relieves muscle tension and knots, providing targeted relief that helps you feel restored and ready to take on the day",
      "The OBT Recovery Body Oil, made from 100% natural and scentless Argan oil, (included in every Kit in our rewards!) is the perfect companion to the Orijin Body Tool. Argan oil, known for its rich moisturizing and anti-inflammatory properties, allows the OBT to glide effortlessly across your skin, reducing friction while nourishing and soothing.",
      "The pain is in the pudding... While the average massage in North America costs around $130 US per session (with high-end spas or specific therapeutic treatments potentially costing more), less than 20% of the 80% of adults who experience body or muscle pain actually seek professional help. With the Orijin Body Tool, we aim to relieve both your tension and your wallet, offering a convenient, affordable way to find relief in the comfort of your home.",
      "We are delighted to offer worldwide shipping! The shipping rate to your country is displayed in the above table. You'll be charged for shipping in our post-campaign survey.",
      "This isn't our first rodeo. We've been fortunate enough to receive funding and deliver on all our campaigns. We'll aim to continue that very same tradition come fulfillment time for your OBT's.",
      "We\u2019re thrilled to introduce the Orijin Body Tool to the Kickstarter community and to create a community of our own, composed of individuals who desire to slow down, be more mindful, present, and aware in their day-to-day lives. Thank you in advance for your support. If you\u2019re new to our community, welcome and thank you for joining us. For those who are returning supporters, thank you for believing in what we do \u2764\ufe0f.",
      "At ORIJIN we strive to slow things down and intentionally think about designs and systems that can be made better. In a world inundated with information and stimuli, we aim to harmoniously intertwine form and function, making designs and systems that provide for the space to be present and aware in our daily lives.\n\nThank you for checking out our campaign <3",

    "company_name": "Nommi",
    "allParagraphs": [
      "Nommi keeps you connected worldwide with virtual sim, dual Wi-Fi and wireless charging.",
      "Nommi is an LTE hotspot with virtual SIM technology and dual wifi for seamless global internet access.",
      "Nommi keeps your personal data safe and your costs low while giving you access to millions of networks so you always stay connected.",
      "Worldwide Use - Nommi's virtual SIM solution removes the need to buy a local SIM in every country you visit or use expensive data roaming. You will be online in 132 countries with fast LTE data and relevant plans. We do also have wi-fi hotspot coverage in 160 countries globally.",
      "Wifi Optimization - Nommi\u2019s unique dual wifi feature saves your cellular data by seamlessly connecting your device to public wifi networks. It also provides a separate guest wifi network that you can share with family and friends. Lastly, it serves a wifi range extender so you can enjoy wifi in a cozier part of your home.",
      "Smart Charging - Nommi's Power version allows you to charge your phone using its Qi Wireless charger by simply placing your device directly onto the charging pad. No more wall chargers, adaptors or USB ports when you're on the go. It's compatible with all Qi-certified devices so \"shoot, my phone battery is dying\" syndrome is replaced with a full charge and more online time.",
      "Nommi is the world's first hybrid device that provides a new kind of connectivity experience in one sleek and portable design. No need to hassle with SIM cards, carry old-fashioned personal hotspot devices or remember to bring your powerbank. To get online, all you have to do is activate a data plan via the app.",
      "Traveling is exciting, but often stressful having to worry about data vs. wifi coverage, roaming fees, and whether or not you\u2019ll be able to contact friends or family. Nommi was designed to solve these added stresses, so there\u2019s little to no change in how you move, communicate, or search in your everyday life.",
      "Nommi offers high quality, global connection for all travel lovers.",
      "While traveling, Nommi allows you to focus on the \u2018travel\u2019 part. Nommi acts as a wireless hotspot for all your devices in over 132 countries. This means wherever you are traveling, you can stop stressing about buying, activating, or inserting SIM cards. Of course, if you already have your favorite data plan from a local operator, feel free to use your SIM. Simply insert it into the micro slot on the side of Nommi like you would on an iPhone.",
      "The easier way is to use a data package via the app and ditch the SIM. That\u2019s right, as soon as you land you can post your selfie from the plane, email your boss or text your Mom with zero lapse in connection!",
      "Customize your Data - Nommi\u2019s user friendly app makes it easy to update and keep track of your usage.",
      "With the Nommi app, you can easily access and manage your device from your smartphone.",
      "You will be online in 132 countries with fast LTE data and relevant plans. We do also have wi-fi hotspot coverage in 160 countries globally.",
      "Prevent unauthorized access to your network and conceal personal data.",
      "By default, Nommi is configured to automatically encrypt all your data through secure servers when you connect to public wifi networks. Although VPN brings extra security, it can make connections slower, so feel free to disable it via the app for the networks you trust.",
      "Making the most of your networks - Nommi only offers the best wifi connection for fast downloading and browsing.",
      "Data is expensive and constantly searching for a local wifi network is exhausting. With Nommi, you\u2019ll never miss out on a strong wifi connection speed and the best part is, you\u2019re simultaneously saving money and data.",
      "Nommi gives you unlimited access to it's worldwide Wi-Fi database and tests surrounding wifi networks before taking you off 4G.",
      "Nommi\u2019s dual-wifi feature is on by default and constantly scans available wifi networks as a background process. When it finds a quality wifi network, it will check to see if our crowdsourced password database contains a password for it. If a password matches, Nommi will try to connect, testing the speed of the network without interrupting your current cellular connection. Once everything checks out, Nommi initializes VPN over the network, tests it one more time and only then starts to route your traffic over public wifi. Ultimately this feature saves your cellular data allowance. As a Nommi user, not only do you have access to a large existing database of passwords, but you can also help curate this global database and share passwords with others by adding them via the app.",
      "Keep your personal network private but still share Nommi with friends.",
      "Similar to professional wifi routers, Nommi will provide two wifi networks (SSID) connections. The primary is your own private wifi network, secured by a strong password and encryption, to which you connect your own devices: laptop, ipad, smart watch, printer, etc. The secondary is a guest wifi network made specifically for your friends and colleagues. This guest wifi allows them to connect without password, but only after the app has notified you and asked for permission. Never again will you have to read the alphabet off the back of your router or spell out complex symbols for your visiting friends. When they are connected, they will be isolated from your primary private network space. Via the app, you\u2019ll also be able to see who is currently connected and how much data they\u2019ve used.",
      "Your long distance relationship solved - Nommi provides a wider reach for low signal areas.",
      "It\u2019s fairly common to have low wifi signal depending on where your home router is located. Let\u2019s say you get bad connection in your room because your router is downstairs. Nommi will automatically extend to the fastest available nearby network, doubling your wifi signal range. You can also specify which signal you want to extend to in the \u201cWi-fi Extender\u201d section via the Nommi app. This feature is useful not only at home, but more importantly at hotels, where you only get good wifi signal near the door, because there\u2019s 1 wifi router per floor. Leave Nommi halfway between you and the wired router location and enjoy strong wifi signal.",
      "Nommi keeps up with the latest technology by combining power and connectivity in one device.",
      "No need to carry that old-fashioned personal hotspot device or a power bank any more. The Nommi Power version combines both.",
      "Place and charge - Remove the burden of disconnecting and inserting a charging cable every time you need you pick up your phone.",
      "Charge your phone using our Qi charger by simply placing your device directly onto the Nommi Power charging pad. Compatible with all Qi-enabled devices, there is no need to plug your device into a wall charger or USB port. It\u2019s extremely convenient and avoids having to buy new USB cables every time your old one breaks. Qi wireless charging is supported by most Android flagship smartphones (Samsung Galaxy, Google Nexus and Pixel, etc) and Apple\u2019s latest iPhone 8 and iPhone X models.",
      "Nommi\u2019s strong battery is intended to keep your charge high over long periods of time.",
      "Nommi\u2019s Slim version has a high performance 3500mAh battery that can deliver more than 16 hours of battery life when 4G/wifi sharing. Nommi\u2019s Power version has a 10000mAh battery that can operate around 48 hours with 4G/wifi sharing. When using the wireless charging function on the Power version, the battery will last long enough to charge your iPhone twice and still work for 24 hours as a 4G/wifi sharing hotspot.",
      "Nommi is the perfect accessory for your next trip.",
      "Finally, the bulky, boring brick that we know as a Power Bank has been revamped to one sleek, portable design. Nommi is convenient and comfortable to hold in your hand and still flat enough to put your smartphone on it. Both the Slim and the Power version are lightweight and compact, designed to take up minimal space in your already packed suitcase, carry-on or purse.",
      "Which model is right for you?",
      "We both [Alyona and Kairat] love traveling. As soon as you exit the airport doors, you smell new scents, feel the temperature, and hear street sounds. You see what people look like, how they dress and know you\u2019re about to have a new life experience. All the feels aside, we also like to stay hyper connected with easy access to our email and social media. It\u2019s the first thing we check in the morning and the last thing we scroll through before bed. When the plane lands, we want to be connected instantly.",
      "Why wasn\u2019t there a device that kept us connected abroad?",
      "Kairat and I met for the first time at an IT conference where we discussed this recurring issue and so, the idea of Nommi was born.",
      "What about one that is equally useful at home to avoid multiple devices?",
      "We spent hours brainstorming the idea in cafes, with friends, even boring our relatives with talks of Nommi. Finally, we decided to start a business to figure out if we were the only ones with this problem.",
      "We ended up learning there are plenty of people like us - people who are not satisfied with the current solutions, who don\u2019t want to buy a monthly data plan when coming to a country for just 3 days, who want to pay just for what they use. We brought up a team around the concept and did tests for more than a year.",
      "Now we\u2019re here, launching our crowdfunding campaign with our first working prototype which you can check out live in action below:",
      "For more detailed information on how to use Nommi, check out our educational videos below. We thank you for your support and are extremely excited to share Nommi with you!",
      "7+ years of experience in corporate segment, with focus on eCom/digital. Works on popularizing of STEM among women. Marketing and business development expertise.",
      "MIPT graduate, 15+ years in ICT industry, started first company 12 years ago, now leading KZ smart-city company, 100+ staff. Telecom, hardware and software expertise.",
      "Interested in hardware from 6 years old. FInalist of international math/robotics competition in Sweden. Degree in IT and certificate at Korean UNIST with the focus on architecture and hardware.",
      "Degree in IT, additional certification at Malaysia Multimedia University. Manages corporate (some are Forbes 500) clients within multiple CIS countries.",
      "5+ years in design. Participant of Salone Satellite Moscow (2014,2015,2017), Salone Satellite Milan (2015), London Design Fair (2016). Her style focuses on sensuality and minimalism.",
      "How does Nommi work?",
      "It acts as usual personal hotspot (mifi), but without need to get new local sim card when you travel. Also it saves your data plan allowance by routing your traffic over wifi networks. The Power version has 10000 battery to provide power bank with with QI wireless charging.",
      "Do I have to buy a monthly subscription in order to use Nommi?",
      "No, not at all. Besides, if for any reason you don\u2019t want that option, you can still insert your data sim card into the standard sim slot that Nommi has, or use Nommi only as dual wifi repeater and range extender (plus powerbank feature in Powerbank version). Please keep in mind, that if you've purchased Nommi via crowdfunding, we provide you with updated wifi passwords in our crowdsourced database free for life. In short, you can still get better wifi experience even without any subscription.",
      "What if I want to return the device?",
      "Your device has warranty policy and if there's anything broken/missing or there's other case indicated in the policy - please reach out to us on this.",
      "Are there hidden extra/fees I should know about?",
      "No fees from our side. However, you may still want to keep your current phone SIM, especially for GSM phone calls and texts. Your current operator will still charge you, but you can lower your bill by switching to a smaller data plan.",

      "How long does it take to fully charge the device?",
      "Nommi Power - about 5 hours\nNommi Slim - about 2 hours",
      "How far does the wifi range extender go?",
      "Generally speaking, Nommi doubles your current wifi range. It will catch another network at 30-50 meters if no concrete walls between and interference (other closed wifis around) is not too much. For example, if your current home wifi router is on the 1st floor, covers the 2nd floor nicely but doesn\u2019t work on the 3rd floor at all, then put Nommi at 2nd floor, it will cover 3rd floor nicely.",
      "Which 3G and 4G frequencies, bands and technologies device support?",
      "Support TD-LTE/LTE FDD/WCDMA/GSM;\nBands: B1/B2/B3/B4/B7/B17/B20/B40/B41; 850/900/1900/2100; 850/900/1800/1900",

    "allParagraphs": [
      "Best Concealed Carry Pocket Knife for Everyday Carry - Lifetime Warranty - Urban Survival.",
      "B-2 Bomber Nano Blade Tactical Pocket Knife",
      "Inspired by the B-2 Stealth Bomber military aircraft, the B-2 Bomber Nano Blade is the last everyday pocket knife you will ever need to carry. The mini tactical B-2 Bomber Nano Blade is designed with precision and detail that allows it to be extremely robust and versatile in every survival situation.",
      "We wanted to design a quality miniature tactical pocket knife that can endure the toughest daily tasks and also small enough to carry without notice. In other words, we wanted an all around badass pocket knife that was fully concealable.",
      "Urban Military Concept: All of our Bomber & Company products have a military design and tactical aesthetic. The B-2 Nano Blade is engineered to hold durability and functionality similar to military grade equipment. Vincent Pilot Ng (Lead Designer) has had over 10 years of professional experience in product design. He has brought about other renown products to markets such as the Bomber Barrel Duffle Bag and Halo Belt.",
      "Blade: The blade is split with a serrated teeth edge as well as a sharp edge. The sharp edge is perfect for thin sharp precision slices whereas the teeth is perfect for tougher materials like wood. The B-2 Nano Blade uses the \"Great American Tooth\" pattern much like in traditional crosscut tree saws. The pattern was designed specifically to saw and rake wood fibers. The blade is also perforated to allow cutting and slicing of materials to not stick onto the blade itself. It provides a cleaner sharper cut.",
      "The non-serrated part of the blade or precision cut blade is flat ground. We were looking into both options during the design process and concluded that a flat ground blade would be more versatile for most people's daily use of an every day carry.",
      "The serrated part (teeth) of the blade, however, is a chisel ground. We designed the serrated part of the knife to be able to scrape flint or even split wood. The blade itself is very robust and the serrated chisel can be used to wedge and pry.",
      "Although the knife is very small, it was engineered to be very tactical. The versatility of both blade styles give it an advantage over every other small pocket knife.",
      "Sizing: Discrete concealability is the definition of the B-2 Nano Blade. The full opened length is only 80mm and when closed, it stands at 48mm in length, 20mm in width (closed) and only 5mm thick. The miniature size of the pocket knife means it can easily be hidden in any coin pocket or clipped onto keychains without notice.",
      "Weight: The ultralight weight of the B-2 Nano Blade comes in at less than 1oz making it the world's lightest, fully functional, 440C black stainless steel tactical pocket knife.",
      "Materials: 440C black stainless steel allows B-2 pocket knives to be one of the strongest nano blades ever created by mankind. Rated at 58-60HRC the B-2 Nano Blade is extremely tough and will stay sharp for longer periods of use. 440C is a highly durable and corrosion resistant stainless steel. The B-2 Nano Blade can endure years of outdoor wear without extra maintenance to protect the blade from rusting.",
      "Casing Design: The B-2 Bomber Nano Blade Pocket Knife embodies a full redesign of the vintage SR288 stock casing. Originally, this discontinued casing was used for full-sized pocket knives ranging from 5 to 9 inches. The reason we have chosen this stock casing is because of its ease of use, comfort, and reliability in tactical use. Our redesign of the stock casing has given the body a tremendous upgrade in quality as well as addressed the original flaws that didn't make it a versatile knife.",
      "We have upgraded the casing material to a heat treated 440C black stainless steel and shrunken the size dramatically to a miniature version similar to its older brother. In addition, we upgraded the blade material to 440C black stainless steel to achieve a 58-60HRC hardness scale.",
      "Upon doing so, we were able to add the Great American Tooth pattern for \"sawing\" tougher materials like wood. Staying true to its size proportionally, the thickness of the casing comes in at 5mm. Ultimately, with the entire redesign, we were able to increase the overall mobility, strengthen the tactical utility of use, make it fully concealable by size, while maintaining a very comfortable hold and improving the military/tactical aesthetics of the entire pocket knife.",
      "Folding/Locking: The B-2 Bomber Nano Blade is both locking and folding. Safety was one of the main concerns when it comes to a knife of this size. We wanted the design the be suitable for beginners as well as intermediate knife experts. The lock is a lever rather than a push button lock. You can actually use the spine to scrap splint without the worry of it coming around when the blade is locked. This makes the knife design much more robust than traditional smaller blades which are just folding.",
      "When the B-2 Nano Blade opens, the lever \"SNAPS\" into place to lock the blade from accidentally closing when in use. The user can feel and hear the tactile sound and click on the lock. To close, all you have to do is press the locking lever to open.",
      "While designing the B-2, we made sure to leave ZERO wiggle room. Once locked into place, the blade is completely tight and will not move. It was incredibly difficult engineering this, as the B-2 is very small in size. We made sure to trial and error fractions of a millimeter to finally get the B-2 to hit perfection.",
      "The B-2 Bomber Nano Blade is the world's smallest and lightest tactical pocket knife ever to be created by mankind.",
      "Minimal and Versatile",
      "Robust and Precise",
      "Functional and Tactical",
      "All Bomber & Company products were originally designed for ourselves. We engineer everything under strict quality and durability standards. It is our promise to provide a lifetime warranty for the B-2 Bomber Nano Blade Pocket Knife. If it ever breaks, send it back to us and we will replace it free of charge.",
      "Our goal was to make the most compact, stylish, and functional miniature tactical pocket knife ever created. With the measurements of 80mm in total length and weighing at less than 1 ounce, the B-2 Bomber Nano Blade is the perfect concealable everyday carry miniature tactical pocket knife.",
      "It's simple. We made the B-2 Nano Blade pocket knife compact and ultra-light while still holding an extremely tactical feel and durability. We eliminate the bulk, weight, and hassle from traditional everyday carry pocket knives, creating a seamless experience for you every single day.",
      "Examples of B-2 NANO BLADE KNIFE USES:",
      "Hi-Res Gallery: HERE",
      "Prototyping:",
      "The following shows the steps of prototyping as well as process of how the B-2 Nano Blade came to life. During the design process, we had a few key elements we wanted to incorporate into the B-2 Nano Blade. The knife had to be small enough to carry discretely, however still big enough to be used as a functional knife. It also needs to be extremely durable. Consequently, we decided to use 440Carbon stainless steel because it is corrosion resistant as well as stronger than most standard 5Cr13MoV stainless steels.",
      "The following picture shows a 2 dimentional drawing of the B-2 Nano Blade. It was our first drawing of the knife. It gives us the very basic design look and length.  Once we achieved the perfect look and tactical feel of the knife, we were able to create a CAD rendering.",
      "Once we had the 2D drawing, we were able to start making a visual product with depth. We then adjusted the thickness of the knife in the CAD rendering to create the perfect 3D model. We then use the 3D CAD model as a blueprint for the first tangible product.",
      "Below is the first handmade prototype of the B-2 Nano Blade. We had used sheet aluminum to wire cut the first prototypes.  As you can see in the pictures, we had cut out the holes for the screws as well as perforation in the blade using this method. This was not a functional prototype, as it was not safe enough to use. The sheet aluminum is soft and just an early design to understand the overall feel, weight, and hold of the knife. Once we had the overall aesthetics of the knife down, we needed it to be fully functional in the following steps.",
      "In the second prototype, we managed to produce it out of real stainless steel. Using 5Cr13MoV stainless steel, we were able to achieve a stronger, more tactile, precise, and functional prototype. This gave us an understanding of first case usage, mobility, and design aesthetics. We also added more functionality to the blade by adding a hole for a keyring, as well as tilted the perforated slots in the blade to a 15 degree angle.  This allowed material to slide off easier than standard verticle perforated holes.  The second prototype does not have a blade edge or a serrated blade.",
      "Our third prototype, we added a precision grind onto the blade. We originally decided to go with a serrated blade \"chisel grind\" (meaning only one side of the blade was sharpened) because we were going to add a serrated section.  The following final prototype shows a \"flat grind\" on the blade because it allowed both left and right handed users.  It was ultimately more versatile. As you can see in the video below, we show the differences between the final prototype and the third prototype with different grinds on the blade.",

      "We put a lot of effort into making HANCEPT Zero Mk2 the perfect pen shape. \nIn particular, the shape of the pen point holder is a structure that transforms from a card shape, so a special engineering structure was required.",
      "After much research and development, we have completed an entirely new engineering structure that is normally stored in side for durability and protrudes when necessary to form a certain angle.",
      "Zero Mk2 is crafted from premium materials like 316L stainless steel, 6000-series aluminum alloy, durable POM, and powerful N52 neodymium magnets. Even after repeated drops, it stays intact, ensuring exceptional durability while maintaining its sleek design and smooth functionality.",

Any additional charges incurred after the initial dispatch of the HANCEPT Zero Mk2 will be the responsibility of the recipient.",
      "Due to the unpredictable nature, and varying policies for each country and delivery region, we cannot cover these fees in advance or include them in our shipping fees. We strongly encourage all backers to double-check their local policies regarding imports from other countries.",
      "The HANCEPT Zero Mk2 is manufactured and shipped from the Republic of Korea, and therefore is not significantly affected by recent U.S. tariff increases on products from China. Changes or reductions of the product's declared value, product type, or product made cannot be made.",
      "HANCEPT is a brand that combines the Korean word \"HAN,\" meaning \"one,\" with the English word \"CONCEPT,\" reflecting our commitment to introducing uniquely one-of-a-kind products to the world.",
      "The journey to bring HANCEPT Zero to mass production was filled with countless trials and refinements. Over 20 complete redesigns were undertaken, and through multiple prototype validation phases and partial renewals, a total of 34 design modifications were made.",
      "From 3D-printed shape verifications to rigorous material testing with aluminum, steel, brass, and titanium, every aspect of strength, weight, and durability was examined. No shape in HANCEPT Zero exists purely for aesthetics\u2014each form serves a purpose, creating a perfect balance of function and beauty.",
      "One of the greatest engineering challenges in developing HANCEPT Zero was perfecting the nib holder. While the idea of rolling a flat plate into a pen is not new, achieving a fully functional nib structure is a different challenge altogether.",
      "Designing a mechanism that forms a precise 20-degree angle was already complex, but fitting this entire structure within a mere 2mm thickness added another level of difficulty. Beyond the mechanical design, ensuring durability and manufacturability required extensive engineering, testing, and refinement.",
      "Ultimately, we developed the patented nib holder that defines HANCEPT Zero, a proprietary technology registered both domestically and internationally.",
      "The average human hair has a thickness of 0.1mm. To perfect HANCEPT Zero\u2019s seven folding hinges and reciprocating slide mechanism, an astonishing precision of 0.01mm\u2014one-tenth the thickness of a hair\u2014was required.",
      "With 54 interlocking components, even the smallest deviation could cause cumulative errors, affecting the overall functionality and precision of the pen.",
      "Since a minor flaw in a single part could impact the entire transformation mechanism, precise manufacturing was essential. To meet these stringent requirements, we employed precision CNC machining\u2014one of the most advanced metal molding and machining technologies available, ensuring each component was crafted with meticulous attention to detail and perfection.",
      "With extensive feedback from our first model,\nwe pushed the design even further to create HANCEPT Zero Mk2.",
      "Every aspect has been refined\u2014from edge and corner enhancements to an optimized folding mechanism. The structure is now sleekly trimmed for smoother storage, reinforced to prevent reverse bending, and engineered for a stronger hexagonal frame that holds firm even under twisting forces. The result? A sleeker, stronger, and more seamless evolution of a groundbreaking design.",
      "It is not simply a pen produced by machines. Inspired by the handcrafting process of premium automatic watches, it is made purely through physical assembly methods without bonding, except for the magnetic fixing process.

      "Being a freeware developer, I'm asking for your help to share the expense of renewing the software certificate that makes Quick Access Popup and Quick Clipboard Editor available for free in complete confidence and safety! Buying a certificate for three years costs $625 USD. This is added to other support expenses (email support system, quickaccesspopup.com domain renewal). This is why I'm asking for your support up to $900 USD.",
      "To contribute, click the PICK YOUR PERK button above, select your currency and enter the amount you wish to donate. Thanks!",
      "I'm Jean Lalonde. the developer of Quick Access Popup (QAP), a Windows freeware that speeds up the work of thousands of PC users around the world, and Quick Clipboard Editor (QCE) and Windows Clipboard enhancer.",
      "QAP is making it easier and faster to open folders, documents or websites, to launch applications or scripts, to paste frequent snippets of text... and much more! It makes it so easy to change the folder in Save As dialog boxes. It will help you find back folders you opened recently or some time ago.",
      "QCE is giving an editing window and a memory to your Clipboard. It saves and retrieve your clips in multiple formats (including images) and allows to edit these clips with powerful commands before pasting with ease it to your destination window.",
      "I first developed these tools for myself. After I made it available on my website (originally under the name Folders Popup for QAP), enthusiast users made sounded suggestions that encouraged me to improve the app to make it the versatile and user-friendly productivity tool it became.",
      "Before I acquired a certificate for QAP, six years ago, more and more users were having problems installing my apps because their antivirus software falsely declared them as malicious (or malware). Protection tools use quick but \"approximative\" methods to detect malicious software. This result in an assumed little risk of producing \"false alerts\".",
      "From time to time, one of the fifty some protection software falsely declare QAP as malicious, while all others say it is clean. The problem is that a given user only sees HIS or HER protection software blocking QAP setup. The best solution to protect QAP against these false alerts it to register it with a \"software certificate authority\". This certification guarantees that the app comes from a legitimate publisher and is in its clean original form. This stopped malware false alerts almost completely.",
      "But this has an ongoing cost. Being a freeware developer, this is why I'm asking for your contribution. Thanks for helping me making QAP available to YOU in complete confidence and safety!",

    "title": "SlimQ F100: The compact 100W charging solution",
    "description": "The most compact worldwide 100W GaNFast charger with PFC, 4 ports, and converting cables",
    "company_name": "Homing Systems",
    "allParagraphs": [
      "The most compact worldwide 100W GaNFast charger with PFC, 4 ports, and converting cables",
      "SlimQ F100 is the by the far the world's smallest 100W GaN charger with a complete PFC function for true global use. Using next-generation GaNFast (gallium nitride) technology for small size and high power, it can charge up to 4 devices at the same time \u2013 from earbuds to phones, to tablets and the MacBook 16\u201d. It is nicely designed and supports most of the fast-charging protocols for modern phones and laptops.",
      "With a dimension of 70 x 68 x 29mm, the SlimQ F100 is smaller than two packs of Doublemint. It is by far the world's smallest 100W charger that has a complete PFC circuit (more about PFC later).",
      "Compared to a series of Apple's chargers, the F100 stands out with more power and more fast-charging ports.",
      "SlimQ F100 is easy to handle and carry around, thanks to its small size and carefully applied exterior material.",
      "If your laptop does not have a USB Type-C power port, don\u2019t worry! We have prepared more than 20 types of converting cables that work with virtually all laptops on the market, including Macbook Pro, Microsoft Surface, Lenovo, Dell, HP, Acer, ASUS, etc. (A list of the cables is in \"specification\" section)",
      "SlimQ F100 works well with Macbook Pro, including the Macbook Pro 15\" and 16\" that consumes max power of 87W and 96W, respectively.",
      "A new power semiconductor material - gallium nitride (GaN) - runs up to 20x faster than old, slow silicon (Si) chips, delivering up to 3x more power conversion and half the size and weight. GaNFast power ICs from Navitas Semiconductor enables the SlimQ F100 fast charger to reach world-class 94% efficiency, which means a cool operation in a small size. For more information on GaN, see www.GaNFast.com.",
      "SlimQ F100 includes a Power factor correction (PFC) circuit. The purpose of PFC is to improve the power factor which means power quality. Although the PFC circuit increases the charger size significantly, it increases energy efficiency, reduces electricity costs, and reduces the load on the electricity system. For adapters that have higher than 75W capacity, the PFC function is necessarily required by government regulations all over the world. With the PFC circuit, SlimQ F100 has a PF value of >0.95 compare to ~0.45 for chargers without PFC.",
      "The presence of PFC also makes our charger more environment friendly compared to one without it. Assume the charger is used 10 hours a day and 300 days a year, compared to one without PFC, our charger can save 230KWHr electricity, which is equivalent to 227 pounds of carbon emission. It takes ten trees to offset that amount of carbon emission.",
      "We believe design is essential and even the center of a product. We designed the SlimQ F100 with multiple use case scenarios in mind. We paid attention to subtle details that might affect the user experience. The following shows the original design sketches that have evolved into an actual product. Along the way, we have made improvements and compromises.",
      "With the design of foldable prongs and clip-on international converters, the SlimQ F100 is quite flexible to be used virtually anywhere in the world. Please note: we will give ONE free converter according to the country of shipping destination. For example, if ship to the UK, the F100 will have a UK converter with it. If ship to South Korea or Germany, it will come with a DE/KR converter. If you need all four converters, please choose them from the add-ons and add them to your order.",
      "There are situations where you will need an extension cable to reach a power outlet. For such cases, the specially designed extension cords will become handy. The cable has the clip-on plug to the F100 to make it look neat and maintain a small footprint.",
      "To show a little gratitude to our backers, we offer this Magnetic tip Type C to Type C cable at a significant discount. This cable is 5A/100W rated and is suitable for USB 2.0 data transmission. It comes in 5 colors and makes an excellent companion to the SlimQ F100 charger. Please note: it is only available as an add-on when you buy a perk.",
      "The product or product package you want to buy is called perks, and everything else is called add-ons. You need to choose the perk first and proceed to payment before you can see the add-ons.  Then on the same page, as you see the \"CHECKOUT\" button, you will see the add-ons available in \"Perks you may also like\" section.  You can browse all the available add-ons left and right; there might be many of them. Note: The following is a screenshot from PC, and it looks different on mobile phones but supports the same idea. Note: One add-on item can only be added once. Please feel free to contact us if there is any question.",
      "We will continue to receive ideas for stretch goals. The first stretch goal we picked is a USB Type-A to Type-C converter. The converter has a small footprint so you can literally leave it on the charger. It supports QC3.0 for fast charging and USB2.0 for data transmission. While we will all be using Type C in the future, we are still in a world of a mix of Type A and Type C. This little converter helps us to manage the transition into the future.",
      "We will include ONE converter for each F100 Charger that you receive when we reach the stretch goal!",
      "SlimQ 65W comes with a FREE anti-tangle Silicone Type-C to Type-C cable and a FREE carry case.",
      "The most challenging work for this product is to fit all the components into a small case and have it working at >100W. The following video shows the out of box board working at >100W consistently. The left screen shows a PF value of 0.99, which is almost perfect. The right screen shows it works at ~108W.",
      "My shipping address is not in the US/Japan/China. What converter do I get? Do I get all the converters?",
      "To avoid causing plastic waste, we do NOT send all four converters for each charger you buy. There are no converters for users in US/Japan/China etc. Otherwise, for each charger you order, we give one FREE converter according to the country of your shipping address. For example, for UK/Singapore/HongKong, we have a UK converter with it. For Korea/Germany, we have the KR/GE converter with it. If you are in EU countries, we will have the EU converter with it. If, for some reason, you do need a different converter, please order the converter package that has all four converters we have. The package is in the list of add-ons and costs $3.",
      "I have an old laptop that does not use Type C, how do I find the right cable for it?",
      "If your laptop is Lenovo, Apple, Surface, etc., it's easy to tell by its tip head. The difficulty may come in if your laptop is using a round plug tip. The reliable way to find the right cable is to find the dimension of the tip and find a matching one on our list. Make sure you find the matching one for a particular brand as some laptop models share the same tip dimension even they are from different brands. To find the dimension, as shown in the following pictures, you can either use a ruler to measure the current cable tip or research it online by using data on your current power adapter (normally on the back of the power adapter). If there is any doubt, please contact info@slimq.life with your computer model and a picture of the spec on your current adapter, so we can help you to find the right cable.",
      "How can I buy multiple cables of the same type?",
      "It is not easy to buy an add-on item multiple times on Indiegogo. Please contact us at info@slimq.life and let us know what the items and how many are. We need to make arrangements for that.",
      "I use the F100 charger for multiple devices, how is the power distributed among the ports?",
      "Please check the section \"Intelligent Power Distribution.\" where you can find a table of all combinations of use cases. Please feel free to contact us if you have any suggestions or feedback on this.",
      "I just bought an F100 yesterday, how to add a cable to my order?",
      "If your order is not in \"locked\" or \"fulfillment\" status, it means your order is still not processed. The easiest is to cancel the older order and make a new one and add the cable in the add-on section to your new order before making payment. If your order is already processed, there is no way to change it, please contact us at info@slimq.life, and we will help you with that.",
      "When will you ship the products?",
      "We plan to start shipping orders within July. For other shipping related questions, please refer to the \"Shipping Policy\" section down below.",
      "Do you have any referral program?",
      "Yes, absolutely. We offer 10% cash reward for any referral purchases. Please use this link to sign up. Then you will have your unique referral link. Just send your referral link to friends or colleagues, when they make a contribution to our project by using your link, you get a 10% reward. It is that simple!",
      "Although quite rare, international shipping may be subject to import taxes, customs duties, and fees levied by the destination country. YOU WILL BE RESPONSIBLE for those charges and procedures to clear custom for the shipped item. Again, it is your full responsibility to clear it by working with the shipping company or custom directly.",
      "It is also the recipient's responsibility for charges such as change of address, parcel holding, return fees caused by the recipient. So please make sure you have the correct address information, including a phone number on file.",
      "1) To which countries do you ship?",
      "We ship globally, excluding those have been flagged by courier services as restricted or high risk: Belarus, Cote d'Ivoire, Cuba, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Liberia, North Korea, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Syria & Zimbabwe. If you would like a shipment to any of these countries, we will make alternative arrangements that may cost more. However, we cannot guarantee the shipment's arrival.",
      "2) Do I have to pay European VAT / GST?",
      "Yes, and the amount will depend on your country\u2019s regulations. However, usually the price is not that high, and people just get it directly.",
      "3) What if my packet gets lost?",
      "If the packet is not marked as \"delivered.\", we can help to locate it and resend it when it gets lost. If the packet is marked as \"delivered\" in the mail system and you don't get it, it is your responsibility to contact the local post office or express company to get it resolved. For us to get involved, you need to get the post office to issue a letter stating the packet gets lost.",
      "SlimQ complies with the Indiegogo refund policy. You can cancel the backing and get fully refunded before the campaign is over. After the campaign finish date, there is no refund.",
      "If you bought the product by mistake, you could contact the SlimQ customer satisfaction team through info@slimq.life. You will need to ship the product back in its original condition and cover the shipping cost. When we receive it, we will issue you a refund by using PayPal.

      "The Key-X was designed by Key2Enable to be the perfect special education resource for students with Cerebral Palsy and many other disabilities and the perfect keypad for adults with Cerebral Palsy or any motor impairment. With the Key-X, a person with any disability can efficiently and autonomously write, work, study and play with a computer, tablet or smartphone without any barriers.",
      "Can you imagine how many thoughts become unexpressed, experiences unenjoyed, and talents unexplored just due to the fact that millions of people with Cerebral Palsy can't make a free and autonomous use of essential devices such as computers? Well, we can, which is why Key2Enable decided to develop a keyboard that is literally a key to open the doors of digital inclusion to people with Cerebral Palsy while also designing it to be just as useful to people with Down Syndrome, Autism, Tremors, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and many other physical, motor and intellectual disabilities.",
      "Developed in Brazil, Key-X has been already tested by over 2,000 people with different disabilities who have enjoyed the easy typing experience that the keyboard offers with its iconographic keys that are activated in double sequences.",
      "They have found that, with Key-X, they can even type any alphanumeric or accentuation character, along with punctuation, symbols, and any other command that is available in a conventional keyboard. This multifunctional keyboard also allows users to have precise control of the cursor on the screen, working like any common mouse, allowing people with Cerebral Palsy and other motor disabilities to work, write, study, research and even play.",
      "Also, keeping in mind the special needs of Key-X\u2019s users, the keypad for people with Cerebral Palsy and other motor impairments is built with large, well-spaced and touch-sensitive keys that allow the use of the panel without needing much force. However, the keyboard is robust enough to resist rough touches, and it can even be used with the feet, to further open more possibilities of usage to everyone who needs such a keyboard.",
      "The Key-X does not require any specific software in order to be used for internet browsing, social networks, text editors and even games, and its plug-and-play USB interface requires no configuration. Indeed, this device has been developed to offer unparalleled autonomy and control over computers, smartphones, and tablets to disabled people who have thus far struggled to make an autonomous and functional use of these devices.",
      "The Key-X also comes with accessories and aid applications that make it even more versatile and efficient as a tool for the digital inclusion of people with Cerebral Palsy and other disabled people:",
      "In the present campaign, we are offering the X-Trig as a complimentary extra reward for the backers who buy the Key-X or donate it to one of the pre-selected organizations that this campaign wants to support through the donation of Key-X Keyboards.",
      "The X-Trig, a robust external click switch, that allows full control of the Key-X for the users whose disabilities keep them from directly using the keyboard, is an accessory that comes with the Key-X as a reward of this campaign",
      "Earlier in 2018, the Key-X earned the inestimable support of the Singularity University, who has taken Key2Enable into its portfolio of companies that are leveraging exponential technologies to address the world\u2019s most intractable problems, and our experience in Brazil has been nothing but encouraging. To say that this fills our hearts with pride and motivation is an understatement.",
      "Gleisson Fernandes, a computer scientist with Cerebral Palsy, was the original developer of a special 9-key keyboard that allowed him to easily use a computer instead of the helmet pointer that he used before. When Key2Enable founders met Gleisson, an immediate friendship and collaboration began. Key2Enable took it from there, eventually developing the Key-X, an improved 11-key version keyboard that has all the functions of a normal keyboard and mouse.",
      "Daniel is learning how to code Java while using the Key-X just by blinking his eyes, using Key-X\u2019s accessory a-Blin-X, which allows people to use the keyboard even if they are severely disabled.",
      "Julia, on the other hand, was isolated due to her struggle with the limitations that Cerebral Palsy previously imposed on her, but she now goes to a regular classroom, in which the Key-X has allowed her to be considered the best mathematics student in her class.",
      "These are just two examples of success stories but, in Brazil, there are literally hundreds of similar stories of children and adults who overcame the typical barriers to communicate, work, study and play by using the Key-X.",
      "By being simply activated through a combination of two keys to delivering one command, and by having only 11 keys that control all the more than 200 functions that a regular keyboard has, Key-X is the perfect tool for the digital inclusion of people with Cerebral Palsy and other disabilities.",
      "Through our Indiegogo campaign, we want to:",
      "Allow people with Cerebral Palsy and other disabled people, as well as those who care for them, to know about our assistive technology and how it can improve their quality of life",
      "Promote the use of Key-X in the USA and around the world, creating an empowering culture for its use",
      "Pilot our Assistive Technologies in selected markets and channels across the United States in the next 6 months",
      "Work on our channels with partners with contracts at schools and reaching organizations for people with motor disabilities",
      "Reach a significant part of the 10 million people with motor disabilities in the United States over the course of the next 3 years",
      "You can support the Key-X Multifunctional Keyboard by purchasing one for yourself or for a loved one, or you can purchase one of these very special multifunctional keyboards and donate it to any hospital or organization in the world that you choose \u2014 and we will make sure that a Key-X will get there.",
      "Alternatively, since every dollar counts, you can make a contribution of any amount and we will pool all these smaller contributions together to purchase Key-X Keyboards and send them to the pre-selected and vetted organizations in our list above. So, when you make a contribution between $1 and $750, please make sure that you let us know to which one of these organizations above you want the Key-X Keyboard that you help to purchase and donate to go.",
      "We're in the early stage of an ambitious worldwide mission to offer autonomous and efficient digital inclusion and empowerment to people with Cerebral Palsy and other disabilities all over the globe to develop their skills, unleash their talents, and explore their individualities. With your help, we can make it happen, and one of the simplest but very effective ways of supporting our campaign is to like, comment and share our project on social media.",
      "For now, we already have some Key-X Multifunctional Keyboard units that are ready to be shipped. However, your contributions will allow us to fund the large-scale production and distribution of the keyboard that is going to make the lives of people with disabilities all over the world so much better.",

      "Flexible back support posture enhancer that fits in your lumbar region.",
      "Back pain at any level is almost universally attributed to our posture. How are you moving? Even with the knowledge of great posture, it is difficult to maintain it while focusing on a task and after our back has fatigued. The Dorsum\u2122 Exospine effortlessly supports your back, follows your movement, and reminds you to maintain great posture.",
      "The quick pace of life is rapidly increasing the risk of back pain and injury. Having the right support that enables solid movement mechanics can reduce the risk of back pain. Modern life is creating jobs that force us to move faster and work longer. All of these demands put extra stress on our shoulders, lower back muscles, and spine. 80% of adults experience back pain at some point in their lives. Here\u2019s where the Dorsum\u2122 Exospine comes in, supporting your lower back without restricting movement.",
      "The most common injuries happen from overuse of our bodies, which are the leading cause of repetitive motion strains. Repetitive motion puts enormous strain on your lower back, which can, in turn, lead to permanent injuries.",
      "Many back alignment products in the market serve different purposes and do not have a significant impact reducing back injuries. The Dorsum\u2122 Exospine exists in a new space we call Flexible Support, focused on prevention rather than rehabilitation.",
      "The Dorsum\u2122 Exospine is focused on postural support and muscular activation. It is not trying to limit the body\u2019s movement; rather, the Exospine encourages it to move properly throughout repetitive movements.",
      "In the market, there are few functional back supports designed for movement. There are posture reminders that are recommended for a short amount of use and back braces that are uncomfortable and restrict movement. The Dorsum\u2122 Exospine is used for better posture while doing sustained repetitive movement.",
      "The Dorsum\u2122 Exospine is for those doing work that requires \u201chinge\u201d movements. \u201cHinge\u201d movement jobs are jobs/activities that require bending over and lifting movements that can cause an individual\u2019s back to severely fatigued. The Dorsum Exospine is there to promote muscular activation so that posture can be maintained and overuse injuries limited.",
      "Use it at work, at home, and while doing recreational activities that require repetitive bending of the lower back and shoulders.",
      "The Dorsum\u2122 Exospine is for:",
      "Anyone that does repetitive movements as part of their daily activity.",
      "Start by turning the thumb screw and pulling the top portion upward to your size of Small, Medium, or Large. Then turn the screw back to a tight position.",
      "From the back, open the tab in the bottom of the pocket to insert the spine component all the way inside the sleeve, and close the tab to secure it in place. The exospine is designed to fit different size torsos of Small, Medium, and Large.",
      "Put on the shoulder straps around your arms.",
      "Close and tighten the waist belt around your hips.",
      "Locate the chest straps and pull outward to feel the support, while closing the straps at the bottom of your chest.",
      "As you move, the Dorsum\u2122 Exospine reminds you to correct your posture without much effort.",
      "It\u2019s comfortable and can be worn over and under clothing.",
      "We used a thermoplastic polymer, a very light and flexible material so it bends and moves with you to support your everyday movements.",
      "Using a 3D air mesh around the sides with a power mesh in the center, all specific fabrics that maximize airflow to keep you comfortable.",
      "The support has a positive feedback loop and 3 points of contact on the spine: the upper, middle, and lower regions of the back.",
      "The positive feedback loop that our brains create relies on multiple factors. If something feels good and you are rewarded for it, your brain will encourage you to seek out that feeling.",
      "The same can be said of the body.",
      "When it feels supported it will seek out the feeling to protect itself. When wearing the Dorsum\u2122 Exospine your body is constantly reminded of proper movement and postural function. So when you take the product off, your body will \u201cremember\u201d to some extent those postural cues and be able to move and stabilize more properly without the product on, teaching you what better posture feels like.",
      "From everything the Dorsum\u2122 Exospine can do, it does the best job at reminding you to have proper posture and movement throughout an activity. It does this on what is called a positive feedback loop. It reminds you to stay within the correct posture to activate your proper muscles when lifting/moving, and maintain proper postural/ergonomic techniques so injury is less likely to occur. When you feel something encouraging you to move properly, you\u2019ll be more likely to do it and are much more likely to avoid injury.",
      "The Dorsum\u2122 Exospine supports your lower back and upper back to stabilize your spine.",
      "It does not restrict movement, allowing you to activate your core muscle groups, and move freely.",
      "It provides all-day comfort to complete an entire day\u2019s work.",
      "Effortlessly reminds you to correct your posture so you can focus on doing the task at hand.",
      "Maximizes airflow so you can comfortably wear it under or over clothing.",
      "It is adjustable to Small, Medium, Large, and XLarge sizes.",

      "The spine component is removable for easy cleaning and the garment is easily washable.",
      "Washable and machine drying safe.",
      "We are a passionate team with a mission to create better products that improve people\u2019s health. It all started years ago when I (Leo) excitedly began work as a wildland firefighter. It was my career path and I went into training for fire suppression. The long days were hard, but on the rides back to camp we were greeted by the locals and thanked for coming in to save their towns from the burning fires. Even in such a fulfilling environment, the repetitive work of lifting equipment and carrying heavy packs took a toll on my back, to the point where resting against the sharp edges of a rock felt better than the pain. Though I found satisfaction in my work, the worry and fear of a potential back injury made me rethink firefighting as a career. I couldn\u2019t risk a back injury.",
      "I went to design school and took with me my experience as inspiration and started interviews with other first responders like myself. In conducting the interviews, I could feel the passion of heroic men and women for saving lives, and when I got to the hard questions, I could hear in their voices how a simple back injury crushed their dreams by preventing them from serving others. The more interviews I did, the more I saw the global problem caused by back pain. The courage of first responders to dive into danger to save a life inspired me to dive into creating my company to solve a problem for them, and that marked the beginning of prototyping a vertical flexible back support that years later would become the Dorsum\u2122 Exospine.",
      "After designing outdoor products and health care devices, and receiving design awards from the earlier concepts, I also kept receiving emails from first responders from all over the world telling me they wanted to go back to work and my prototype could help them.",
      "I built a team passionate for helping others and shaped Dorsum into the company it is today, making products that will limit career-ending injuries.",
      "Our first prototypes were designed to be worn over clothing, but they proved to be too hot and bulky.",
      "We reduced the weight and added ventilation using athletic compression fabrics and air meshes for a more breathable and comfortable support.",
      "Explored designs to best align the upper back in the correct position.",
      "We started 3D printing and looked at more ways to reduce material and size but still maintaining the right amount of support.",
      "We made it even more flexible, stronger, and easier to use.",
      "We conducted several rounds of fit tests to select the best design that would add the most comfort & support.",
      "We put it to the test under intensive training exercises doing repetitive motion activities requiring fast bending, twisting, and turning of the torso and spine. Several rounds of sweat tests helped us discover the areas that needed more ventilation.",
      "Back pain can end careers and dramatically change lives for the worse, and we want to help fix that.",
      "We created the Dorsum\u2122 Exospine as an answer to the many stories of career-ending back injuries we have heard and as a way of honoring and showing gratitude to the courageous first responders who participated in our tests. The Dorsum\u2122 Exospine will have a major impact on improving people\u2019s lives and we hope you will join us in our effort to make a difference in back health.",
      "We have many people to thank, many people who have shared their stories of back pain, given feedback, and participated in our product testing. But most importantly, the heroic men and women first responders who risk their health for the safety of others. Your ability to respond to emergencies has truly been an inspiration in our work, and for that, we thank you.",

      "The evolution of our successful Totem spinning top, now smaller, more stable, quieter, more spinning hours and made of metal.",
      "We have evolved our design from our previous plastic spinning top. By choosing aluminum as the new material, we have slightly reduced its size (33,10mm (1,30'') wide and 39.42mm (1,55'') tall), changed its motor to a smaller and more efficient one and redesigned its profile with a more attractive look. In addition, the new weight gives it a solid and quality feel.",
      "After several improvements and elimination of assembly and design issues, we have increased the battery life by 50% to a total of more than 6 hours of continuous spinning.",
      "Created in aluminum and titanium, each Metal Totem has a unique look and finish. With high precision milling all of our spinning tops look luxurious even when resting on the table.",
      "We offer 2 versions of black color, matte and shiny. We want you to enjoy the full Metal Totem experience, so we offer rewards with 2 and 3 tops.",
      "The motor, circuit and rotation sensor have been chosen and adjusted to the needs of sensitivity, efficiency and power.",
      "New motor is quieter, smaller and more efficient than that of the previous version of Totem. In addition, it is easier to produce it so we will have several manufacturers supplying all the motors we need.",
      "It's powered by a single CR2032 cell battery, perfect for its size and capacity. It can be changed in seconds, no recharging time required. A rechargeable LIR2032 battery can also be used, so there is no need to buy batteries every time they run out.",
      "A year and a half ago we launched our first crowdfunding campaign. With hundreds of orders and exceeding our fundraising goal we consider that we did a great job.",
      "We want to apply what we learned to this project and increase Totem's reach. We appreciate the support received, we hope it will also be a success.",

The team is specialized in searching for ideas, identifying problems and creating solutions where engineering and design build unique products. With the collaboration of external companies, METAL TOTEM will be completely designed, developed and manufactured in Spain.",
      "With this new challenge, we intend to put all our efforts into making it a successful project once again.",
      "We have learned a lot from our previous campaign and we want this one to be better planned and executed. We know where the potential problems are and we want to stick to the schedule.",
      "We have a reliable supplier for the metal parts and several backup companies. The electronic components are relatively easy to get, however we want to have enough of them before we start assembly.",

Products are being delivered to our warehouse early July. \n\nOur mission is to introduce innovative and meaningful solutions for comfort, support, and relief in your daily life through functional products like the Sitpack Zen X series.",
      "Are you looking for a portable seat that won't take up space in your backpack, enhances your balance, strengthens your lower back, and relieves aching knees and ankles? Look no further\u2014the vastly improved and upgraded Sitpack Zen is here",
      "Whether you're at home, at the office, or out in the great outdoors, Sitpack ZEN is designed to help you maintain perfect posture wherever life takes you. This truly ergonomic, height-adjustable chair allows you to relax in comfort while staying aligned, supporting your body\u2019s natural posture.",
      "We've taken our signature design and your valuable feedback to heart to create a chair that's not only ultra-portable but also incredibly functional. With key upgrades in comfort, durability, and usability, the new Sitpack Zen is the chair you've been waiting for!\nDesigned to meet the needs of adventurers, outdoor enthusiasts, and anyone on the go, the new Sitpack Zen is perfect for those who value both convenience and functionality.",
      "We\u2019ve listened closely to your feedback from our previous Zen campaign, and we\u2019re excited to share how we\u2019ve turned your input into meaningful improvements.",
      "\"The Y-Shape of the ZEN is the perfect angle to suspend a seat that is ergonomically designed to adopt each user. The \"hammock\" shaped seat provides both optimal comfort and flexibility\"",
      "We used materials made of recycled plastic to increase the seat size for greater comfort. We added a luxurious memory foam quilted seat.",
      "Our decade long experience in designing chairs has clearly given us valuable insights into creating products that address these specific needs.Sitpack 2.0 and Zen uniquely support and aid the improvement of each of these below conditions, for instance:",
      "These details not only highlight your products' functionality but also demonstrate the thought and expertise that have gone into their development.",

      "The Original Zen's foot mount had some challenges, but we've addressed this by reinforcing it with an aluminum insert, providing unparalleled stability in any situation. This enhanced design ensures it\u2019s stronger than ever.",
      "Previous backers will be able to purchase the new and improved foot, how ever it does require some installation skill. Guide will follow.",
      "A lot of our Zen backers pointed out that  was the lack of storage options for Zen. There were no carry case and no pocket, so Zen users have been using socks for easier storage. Finally with this new integrated pocket Zen socks are now completly redundant.",
      "With our brand-new \"button\" addition to the seat, packing up has never been easier. Simply use the button as leverage to lift the seat off the aluminum wings after loosening the seat straps and pushing down the ring. It's a quick and effortless process that gets you ready to go in no time!",

      "Now is the Time to Join Us in Bringing the Next Generation of Sitpack Zen to Life",

      "Don\u2019t miss your chance to be among the first to experience the new Sitpack Zen\u2014back our campaign today and secure your very own.",
      "We\u2019ve thoroughly reviewed the adjustable chairs available today, and there\u2019s still nothing quite like the Sitpack Zen. Since our launch in 2015, there have been virtually no options for high-seated, portable seating. However, after introducing Sitpack and achieving global sales, the market saw an explosion of seating solutions. Yet, even now, nothing matches the design of the Sitpack Zen X\u2014it's never even been copied. Why? Because it\u2019s an incredibly challenging product to make, arguably one of the most demanding seating constructions ever created.",
      "In our view, only one other chair on the market embodies the innovation and functionality that portable seating should deliver.",
      "You can use the Sitpack ZEN for commuting, going to the kids' football match, hiking, trekking, and more!",
      "If you backed our initial Zen campaing or go back and read about it you will find that we did have a ton of issues with our first partner B2B Link China. I will not go into detail, but the company was not mature to take on a project like Zen that requires so much detail. After things went south, we moved our molds to 3 other factories for testing, non of the factories where able to make a a fully automated production, as the molds was in such a bad state, that each part needed manual processing.",
      "To bring these improvements to life, we\u2019ve partnered with the reputable company Shinning Way Sourcing, renowned for their commitment to quality and innovation.",
      "This collaboration has enabled us to address every issue from the previous model with precision and care. From the enhanced locking mechanism to the reinforced foot mount, every component has been rigorously tested to meet the highest standards.",
      "With this partnership, we\u2019re confident that the new Sitpack Zen not only exceeds expectations but also sets a new benchmark for portable seating.",

I\u2019ve lived the struggle: cold nights, long walks, and overpriced Ubers just to get from a dorm to a party or back home. Buzz is the safer, more affordable solution. Our LED-lit vans, real-time event data, and $5 rides aren\u2019t just about getting from point A to B, they\u2019re about building a better college experience. Alongside my partner and co-founder, Jack Nagy, who leads our marketing as CMO, we\u2019re building something for students, by students.",

      "$15,000: App development (real-time tracking, scheduling, and live nightlife insights)",
      "If we don\u2019t hit the full goal, funds will still go toward launching a smaller test fleet to pilot the service.",
      "The Impact",
      "Buzz is more than a ride, it\u2019s a movement. Your support will directly provide students with a safer way to enjoy college life without breaking the bank or putting themselves at risk. No more overpriced rides. No more long walks alone at night. Just a reliable, fun, and student-first experience.",
      "With early interest from MSU and partnerships in progress, we\u2019re ready. Jack and I are both students who\u2019ve lived the problem and now we\u2019re building the solution. We are confident Buzz will transform nightlife and safety on campuses everywhere.",

We face hurdles like insurance complexities, regulatory approvals, and logistical coordination, but Jack has built businesses before, I have managed national logistics for global brands, and we know how to bring this to life. We surround ourselves with mentors who have 20+ years of real world business experience.",

      "Line Drawing:\nOnce the initial design was set, we translated the sketch into precise line drawings, where we refined every curve, angle, and dimension. This stage ensured that the proportions were just right and that the design would translate into a usable, ergonomic tool.",
      "3D Modeling:\nWith the line drawing as our blueprint, we created detailed 3D models, allowing us to visualize the knife in full depth. This step was crucial for evaluating ergonomics, handle shape, and blade geometry, ensuring that every element of the design was optimized for both form and function.",
      "3D modeling",
      "3D Printing:",
      "With the help of 3D printing technology, we created multiple prototypes for physical testing and functional verification. User feedback was invaluable, guiding us to make further improvements. We iterated on the design, optimizing ergonomics, aesthetics, and the overall user experience.",

    "company_name": "Sanjai Tripathi",
    "allParagraphs": [
      "The AUTOMATED Table Saw Fence",
      "Rip-it\u2122 is a retrofit system that adds affordable automation to your existing table saw setup. Professional woodworkers love Rip-it because it is fast, precise, and easy to use. Table saw work goes up to six times faster! Rip-it pays for itself within weeks in a busy shop.",
      "The system includes a motorized fence with touchscreen control, rack rail, and angle bracket. Here is a brief video showing the core function of Rip-it: dial your desired cut width, the fence moves quickly into place, and then make your cut",
      "Rip-it was invented by master cabinetmaker Jeff Hadaway, who recruited a team of skilled designers, engineers, and businesspeople (\u201cTeam Rip-it\u201d) to develop a robust product and bring it to market. Team Rip-it launched the product first on Kickstarter in July 2023, aiming to raise $150k for final development and manufacturing setup costs. And we succeeded! The campaign ultimately raised $216k from 211 backers. Their support has validated that customers are excited about the product and provided the necessary funding for the first production batches.",
      "Since the Kickstarter, we have heard from several others who want to back the project. In response, we have opened this Indigogo InDemand campaign! InDemand is a platform that enables companies to continue raising money as they start manufacturing and delivering products after a successful crowdfunding campaign.",
      "We are now offering Rip-it as an InDemand backer reward. With this limited-time offer, woodworkers can get Rip-it at a discount off the MSRP while helping to support the manufacturing launch as it occurs. Our target date to fulfill InDemand backer rewards is MAY 2024.",
      "Between now and then, we are finalizing the details of the product design, purchasing components inventory, setting up production, and then making and delivering the first batches of Rip-it. As that work proceeds, we will post updates here on InDemand (and via email and social media channels) so backers and supporters can follow the progress.",
      "The previous Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign provided sufficient capital for us to start production and deliver Rip-it to campaign backers. Team Rip-it is 1000% committed to delivering a finished, robust product and we are immensely and eternally grateful for backers' support.",
      "While additional funds are not needed to launch the product, they would certainly be helpful as we navigate the details and uncertainties of the production launch and build up inventory for future deliveries and sales. Additional funds would allow us to order larger quantities of machined parts and components, reducing costs and supply chain risks.",
      "For Indigogo InDemand backers, we can offer a complete Rip-it fence system as a backer reward. The complete system includes the digitally controlled fence, rail, and bracket to retrofit your existing table saw and table. The standard rail is 86\", which provides 52\" of rip capacity on the right side of the blade and 16\" on the left in our recommended configuration (see below), and users can move or cut the rail shorter to fit their table setup. Our target date for fulfillment of InDemand rewards is MAY 2024.",
      "Rip-it is the product of careful, iterative design and development. The result is a product that is functional while also being robust, full-featured, and easy to use.",
      "Intuitive Touchscreen Control",
      "Control Rip-it via the touchscreen with an intuitive, high-contrast interface that offers the choice of SAE or metric units and fractional or decimal display. The current design includes a 5.5\" screen, and the final production design will have a 7\" screen.",
      "Auto Locking",
      "Once it reaches the precise location, Rip-it automatically locks firmly into place with no action required by the user.",
      "Automatic and Manual Calibration Options",
      "Activate the auto calibration with a push of the button. Rip-it moves gently to touch the blade and detect the zero point. Or, calibrate the zero manually and set it at your preferred location. Rip-it only needs to be calibrated once at startup and will maintain accuracy for the entire shift.",
      "Choice of Units",
      "Users may select inches in fractional or decimal formats, centimeter, or millimeter units.",
      "Jog Function",
      "Use the jog buttons to control the motor directly, moving the fence in either direction for small or large adjustments.",
      "This project is the culmination of a dream that is years in the making. Jeff (the inventor) had the idea for Rip-it over 20 years ago. He had a prototype created and called the product \"Pick-it Fence.\"",
      "That initial attempt to bring the idea to market did not succeed, and the dream went on \"pause\" for a while, but Jeff never let it go. It stayed in the back of his mind. Eventually, he decided to try again. He recruited help from Steele Inc., a product design firm, to upgrade and update the product with modern materials and technology.",
      "The first update Steele Inc. designed featured a touchscreen, modern software control, and an aluminum unibody frame.",
      "Another (very shiny) prototype was created for live testing in professional shops.",
      "The 2023 update included a host of design-for-manufacturing improvements. The final version shipped to backers will be similar to this version but with a few additional enhancements, including a larger touchscreen, more robust mechanicals, and accessory T-slots on the top.",
      "The product is being brought to market by the Rip It Fence Company, which is based in Corvallis, Oregon, and has a manufacturing facility in Roseburg, Oregon. Our company mission is to fulfill Jeff's dream, deliver the product to all the backers, and then continue manufacturing and selling it in the future. We also have plans to develop a series of other affordable automated tools for professional woodworking shops based on the same technology platform developed for Rip-it.",
      "Developing any new product entails inherent risks, challenges, and uncertainties. We are highly aware of those and have worked to identify and mitigate those as best we can.",
      "One issue companies of all sizes and types have had to deal with lately is supply chain disruption. Manufacturing companies are particularly vulnerable if a key component becomes unavailable. With this in mind, we use common \"off-the-shelf\" parts as much as possible and have identified multiple suppliers for most of them. We also have identified local domestic suppliers for extrusion, machining, and anodization of the custom aluminum parts that go into Rip-it.",
      "Many new product companies struggle during the development stages due to delays, cost overruns, or failure to meet customer requirements and demands. To mitigate those risks, we have pursued an agile development strategy that involves building multiple successive prototype versions and incorporating user feedback and testing into each step. This way, we ensure we are developing what customers need and want.",
      "Some companies fail because of cash flow problems or because their business model has fundamental problems. To mitigate these risks, we carefully identified each component on the bill of materials and created detailed COGS and operating expense forecasts. We have received updated parts quotes and secured the lease on our manufacturing facility since the Kickstarter campaign ended, and our forecast model has proven to be accurate so far",
      "Ultimately, our goal is not just to get crowdfunding money. Our goal is to create a business that lasts. With that in mind, we have done and continue to do everything we can to make sure the Rip-it launch is successful, backers receive a great product as promised, and the business is sustainable in the long run.",
      "We have gotten this far thanks to the interest and support of many people, including woodworkers, media partners, service providers, and others who have helped us in various ways over the past few years.",
      "We are offering Rip-it on InDemand to offer one more chance for people to pre-order at a discount before the official launch.",
      "And even if you don't become a backer, you can help us spread the word! Tell your woodworking friends about the product, hit \"like\" to boost our page prominence, and use the Share Tools links to mention us on Facebook, copy the link to share anywhere, and like and follow us on Instagram and YouTube.",

      "I'm Derrick Mayes, founder of DreamSiphon design. I am an industrial designer, hardcore automotive enthusiast, and metalhead \\m/ (My credentials: http://www.mdesign119.com)\n\nA few years ago, my friend Kody asked me to design a wing for him.  I had never designed a wing specifically but I made it happen as a bespoke one off kit. It is an incredible feeling to see a product you designed and engineered yourself come to life and set off such a cool car. Several times after, I went to car shows with him and got to see that wing win awards as part of his epic widebody RCF build. \n\n\n\n\nOver my 10+ year career of designing products, I have asked myself numerous times what is keeping me from producing products for my own brand. What is stopping me from bringing my own dreams to life? As someone who brings concepts to fruition everyday for a living, I hope to not only bring my vision to life but complete dreams across the world as my products complete your unique automotive builds!\n\nThis campaign is particularly special given my current financial situation. I was abruptly laid off in February 2025, and immediately I set out to make something of my own and churned out several concepts. I teased those concepts to the N-Performance community and got so much feedback. This campaign goes nowhere without their support, yet I'm trusting that they stand behind me. I have gotten so many messages from the coolest people letting me know that what I'm bringing is just what the N community needs; aftermarket support, and truly unique design thinking. How have such excellent performance/enthusiast cars been left so bare by the aftermarket? The Elantra N is one of the most incredible performance bargains on the market this decade and I'm here to make sure it gets the love it deserves!",
      "Guys, although being in the USA means opportunity and just about anyone is able to start a business, it is one of the hardest times to do so in recent times. Small businesses everywhere are having difficulty just staying afloat as tariffs and rising costs across everyone and everything continue, but I can't let that stop me. \n\nSo to launch this brand with adequate funding, I am shooting for $30k. Of course, not without providing excellent rewards for your support. Your contributions are rewarded not only with prizes but ensures these and future concepts get made. \n\nHow these funds are used:\nProduction costs\nShipping costs\nTariffs\nSnowballing More Products\n \n\n\nCheck out the perks! This could be your only chance to secure 1 of 250 Limited Alcantara Armrest! Standard black armrests to follow.",
      "There is a risk that I will be faced with extremely high tariffs at the time of product shipment. That is why it is imperative that I set an adequate goal and reach it. I will use my life savings to guarantee these products here and into your hands.\n\nAs a solopreneur, it is a challenge to set healthy boundaries around how many hours I work, and how much of myself I spread to make this happen. I am juggling two children, and a lot of life at the moment but as someone who has an excellent track record of designing and delivering products, and a passion as deep as mine, I hope you are rest assured.",
      "I will be shipping products ASAP to when I receive inventory. I estimate early August as when these shipments can begin. This is subject to delays and hiccups but I will continue to keep my social media platforms (Reddit, Facebook, Instagram) informed on the progress of this business as a community driven operation!",

      "We want to make some amazing upgrades to our SousVide Supreme that will elevate it to a new level.",
      "From the company that revolutionized cooking with the first at-home sous vide, the original SousVide Supreme, comes the next chapter in sous vide cooking.",
      "With your help our new SousVide Supreme Touch+ will revolutionize sous vide cooking once again.",
      "We\u2019re the company who brought sous vide cooking to home kitchens around the world. We want to make some amazing upgrades to our SousVide Supreme that will elevate the sous vide cooking experience to a whole new level.",
      "The new SousVide Supreme Touch+ will have a similar look and feel to the iconic original SousVide Supreme, but with some innovative upgrades that will make it not only the most convenient sous vide machine to use, but the most advanced at-home sous vide machine there is. The Touch+ will include ingenious features such as:",
      "Sous vide? We\u2019re glad you asked. The words literally mean \u201cunder vacuum\u201d in French and they describe a cooking technique, first developed in France  in the 1970\u2019s by Chef Georges Paulus; it relies on precise temperature control rather than great skill and perfect timing to achieve chef-worthy results. Food is vacuum-sealed and immersed in a precisely heated water bath to cook gently and perfectly. When you cook sous vide, your food develops deep flavors and textures that no other cooking method can duplicate.",
      "While the term sous vide means \u201cunder vacuum\u201d, you might just as well define it as \u201cstunningly simple\u201d especially when you use the Sous Vide Supreme Touch+. The sous vide cooking process boils down to three steps:",
      "1. Season - Season foods with your favorite herbs or spices.",
      "2. Seal - Vacuum seal food in a food-grade cooking pouch.",
      "3. Sous Vide - Drop the sealed packages into the SousVide Supreme. No need for office clips, extra pots, Styrofoam coolers or ping-pong balls. The water oven does most of the work. Just set it and walk away!",
      "We are the original innovators, who brought sous vide cooking to home kitchens around the world and our patented technology is unique. SousVide Supreme's award-winning technology and product design features a PID-controlled edge-to-edge heating element that blankets the bottom of the water oven. A perforated convection plate generates thermal currents for even temperature distribution. Our patented lid contains heat for energy efficiency, contains steam to prevent evaporation, and even serves as a tray for transporting pouches from the water oven to the stove or grill. It\u2019s also a sleek and beautiful and counter-worthy machine.",
      "The natural thermal circulation created by the design works with the basic physical properties of water to evenly heat the water to the target temperature throughout the bath, from top to bottom and corner to corner, without the need for a circulating propeller or pump. The precise temperature control gently brings the food to its ideal doneness and cooks it perfectly from edge to edge. Once brought to temperature, the efficient heat transfer capacity in our enclosed, self-contained system uses only about the energy of a 20 watt light bulb to precisely maintain the target temperature for hours or even days.",
      "And now with integrated wifi and Alexa capabilities powered by our new app, the SousVide Supreme Touch+ will be the most technologically advanced sous vide water oven on the market.",
      "It's time to ditch your \"science project\" and step up to a state-of-the-art, serious sous vide appliance. Unlike circulator sticks, there is no remembering to put a hot pad down so your pot doesn't burn your counter, connecting a circulator to a pot, using an office clip to fasten a flimsy plastic bag to the side, and then creating a lid out of ping pong balls or foil to keep the heat in. No need to set the alarm to remember to add water lest the pot boil dry.",
      "The revolutionary SousVide Supreme Touch+ is an all-in-one cooking appliance that will make it easier for cooks\u2014from beginners to top chefs\u2014to consistently prepare gourmet quality food at home and have more time do the other things they really love.",
      "Learn more about the differences between an all-in-one SousVide Supreme and an immersion circulator:",
      "It goes without saying that the sous vide cooking technique will make you the envy of your friends, but the benefits go far deeper than mere peer adulation and they all come down to three things: better nutrition, free time, and more money. Here\u2019s what\u2019s in it for you!",
      "1. Ricotta Cheese/Yogurt - The precisely-controlled water temperature makes cheese and yogurt-making effortless. Because the bath is unstirred, you can make them right in the water oven basin without a pouch.",
      "2. Condiments - Use your imagination to develop your own condiments! Grainy mustard, Worcestershire sauce, hot dill pickles, pickled summer veggies, and more.",
      "3. Cheesecake - An unstirred sous vide bath is already the perfect bain marie for cooking traditional oven recipes requiring a water cushion and constant temperatures, like cheesecake, cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, or flan! Using a SousVide Supreme eliminates the challenge (and danger) of sloshing hot water onto the floor when filling or removing a pan from a traditional oven.",
      "4. The perfect egg - Just set the temperature and put eggs in their shells directly into the water bath to cook and BAM\u2014perfect poached eggs! And best of all, they\u2019ll hold just as perfectly cooked for hours!",
      "5. Soup stock - Use an unstirred water bath to make luscious bone broth or stock right in the water bath basin\u2014no pouch required\u2014to use for homemade soup or just to drink for good health!",
      "6. Custards and ice cream base - No need for constant stirring to keep from scorching your custard on a stovetop. With sous vide you\u2019ll be able to make perfect custard for homemade ice cream, cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, or flan, just like a pro.",
      "7. Overnight oatmeal - Drop a pouch of oatmeal into the water oven at bedtime and it will be ready when you wake up. Say goodbye to that \u2018no time for breakfast I\u2019m just grabbing coffee\u2019 excuse as you\u2019re running out the door for work in the morning!",
      "8. Epic Bloody Mary - Use the sous vide technique to create the perfect pickled vegetables\u2014asparagus, okra, or green beans \u2013 for an epic Bloody Mary! You can even infuse the horseradish right into vodka in a matter of hours in a water oven.",
      "9. Gourmet vinegar - Precise cooking temperatures help to quickly transfer flavor from herbs, spices, and berries without holding your kitchen hostage with that vinegar smell!",
      "10. Infused alcohols and syrups - Traditionally made limoncello takes weeks or months to make. With sous vide, that timeline drops to hours or in some cases even minutes! The gentle heat speeds up the process of transferring natural flavors to the alcohol, helping you create old school cocktails on short notice for an impromptu dinner party!",
      "It all started with a pork chop. We (The Drs. Eades, pere and mere) had arrived late to a medical meeting in Las Vegas and were extraordinarily tired and hungry. We ordered a double-cut pork chop off the room service menu (in truth, with some slight reservations, because you\u2019d expect a room service chop to be dried out and overcooked.) But when we took a bite, it was like no pork chop we had ever eaten: juicy and perfectly cooked from edge to edge with a golden crust on the surface. Simply divine! We were so surprised, we asked at the dining room how it was cooked and they told us \u2018sous vide\u2019. We vowed to find a machine that would replicate that chop.",
      "We know food and cooking. We\u2019ve owned a restaurant, written and hosted a 26-episode PBS television cooking show, authored a NY Times best-selling diet book, as well as being nutritional experts and physicians by trade. But it was through our quest to recreate that perfect pork chop that we discovered our passion for sous vide cooking.",
      "Our first stab at cooking sous vide at home involved a DIY makeshift contraption that consisted of a large stock pot, balanced over the gas burner atop a simmering ring from an old wok, with a candy thermometer hooked to the side. The two of us kept watching minute-by-minute, adding ice cubes or hot water as needed throughout the hour-long cooking process to keep the temperature steady. Suffice it to say it wasn\u2019t the most convenient method, but it worked and the steak we cooked was delicious!",
      "We were convinced we had to have more of this sous vide cooked food, but neither of us willing to stand over the pot with ice cubes for an hour, so we scoured the internet trying to find a home sous vide machine. To our dismay, we found that the only sous vide cooking machines on the market were made for industrial labs or commercial kitchens, and the least expensive device was around $1,500 to $2,000. At the time, there was no device for the home cook, so we set about to make one. We assembled a team of designers, manufacturers, and culinary professionals and launched our dream to develop the first home sous vide machine, our original SousVide Supreme water oven, and to fulfill our mission to bring sous vide cooking to our home and to the masses.",
      "Our SousVide Supreme has received international acclaim - check out what others have said:",

      "Foil Smarter, Progress Faster. Onboard camera and motion tracking, built to help you foil better.",
      "Hello, I\u2019m Duncan, the Founder of SmartFoil.",
      "I started foiling a few years ago and loved it.",
      "But progress was slow \u2014 fall after fall \u2014 and I had no clue what I was doing wrong. I felt like I was on my own.",
      "I thought there must be a better way to learn, so I started testing some ideas.",
      "A year later, after a lot of work, I\u2019m proud to present SmartFoil.",
      "It all started with wing foiling, and I struggled with gybing and tacking.",
      "It felt like a dark art, even after watching all the YouTube videos.",
      "When my partner filmed me, I could finally see what I was doing wrong. But I didn\u2019t like asking \u2014 and I didn\u2019t want a GoPro stuck on the front of the board.",
      "Then I got into pump foiling.",
      "It was addictive \u2014 but so hard.",
      "I saw an ad for CARV, an AI ski coach that uses motion metrics to give feedback.",
      "And I thought, there should be something like this for foiling.",
      "Being able to see your balance, rhythm, freequency, etc. That would be really cool.",
      "Then comparing to the pros you'd be able to see how to improve easily.",
      "So now combining all this we have a device which can work for all foil sports.",
      "So combining video with motion data we can use AI to give feedback every session.",
      "Your technique, pitch, roll, yaw, speed, acceleration \u2014 all automatically analysed.",
      "Then getting real insights on your gear, your progress, and how to improve.",
      "It\u2019s like having a coach with you every time you foil.",
      "I thought I was onto something but needed the pro's to be onboard.",
      "I started speaking with top coaches, and they also thought it was a great idea.",
      "We are really appreciative of these guys below supporting our vision and sharing their passion.",
      "Then Olympic sailing coaches reached out to see how SmartFoil could help their teams.",
      "We're excited to support Olympic teams in their quest for medals.",
      "Supported By The Community",
      "A huge thanks to the Pioneers who\u2019ve already joined us.",
      "They share the vision and belief in what we\u2019re building \u2014 and none of this would be possible without them.",
      "If you support this campaign, you\u2019ll help us:",

      "Every stitch, every story, every risk - help me keep going.",
      "Hi, I\u2019m Sofia Moussier \u2014 a Detroit-born creative, designer, and visionary behind Soreem, a fashion and storytelling brand I launched nearly a decade ago at just 18 years old.",
      "I started Soreem out of self-rebellion \u2014 it was my way of finally speaking for myself, of healing, and of creating a world that made room for people who felt like me. No investors. No roadmap. Just a dream stitched together by courage, creativity, and community. Over the years, Soreem has grown from a streetwear vision into a full-bodied creative platform that inspires others to live freely, dress boldly, and walk in their truth.",
      "Now, I\u2019m preparing for the next chapter \u2014 one that honors all the evolution and purpose that\u2019s gotten me here. With your help, I can bring a milestone vision to life that expands what Soreem is and who it\u2019s for.",
      "Your support helps me keep telling stories through fashion \u2014 and makes you a part of the story too. Follow @livesoreem and @sofiamoussier for updates as well.",
      "I\u2019m raising $10,526.32 to bring Soreem\u2019s next phase to life. This funding will cover:",
      "The amount also includes a 5% buffer for Indiegogo fees, ensuring that the full project receives what it truly needs.",
      "As a thank-you, I\u2019ve created a range of digital and physical perks that align with the spirit of Soreem and this project\u2019s world. From heartfelt thank-you notes and digital wallpapers, to exclusive early access to visuals, merch, and even tickets to the next Soreem event \u2014 these perks are intentional, meaningful, and curated just for this community.",
      "If I don\u2019t reach the full goal, I\u2019ll scale the project in phases \u2014 beginning with the most essential pieces like garment production and the visual campaign. I\u2019ll continue to secure in-kind support, collaborate with nonprofits, host community fundraisers, and apply for grants and residencies to push the vision forward.",
      "Soreem has never just been about clothes \u2014 it\u2019s about storytelling, self-expression, and creative liberation.",
      "In a world that constantly asks us to shrink, Soreem invites us to expand \u2014 to wear our truths, to unearth our voices, and to move through life like the art we are. Your contribution helps us continue creating powerful visuals, garments, and experiences that awaken something in people \u2014 something deeply personal and deeply shared.",
      "I\u2019ve independently grown my creative impact through:",
      "With your help, we\u2019re not just making art \u2014 we\u2019re building a new language for fashion and storytelling.",
      "My biggest challenge is raising this funding before September 2025 to meet key deadlines for design production, collaborative projects, and rollout. While I\u2019ve received incredible in-kind support from venues and promo partners, many corporations who love the vision simply don\u2019t have the budget right now.",
      "But I\u2019ve always found a way.",
      "I\u2019ve created shows with no budget, launched projects with nothing but heart, and built communities from scratch. I plan to overcome financial challenges by continuing to partner with local orgs, barter services, host community fundraisers, and scale in phases if necessary.",
      "This is a leap \u2014 but one I\u2019ve prepared for with a solid plan and a fearless sense of purpose.",
      "If you can\u2019t contribute financially, that\u2019s okay \u2014 your voice still matters.",

      "We've all been there. You're lying in bed, trying to drift off to sleep, when suddenly you remember that you forgot to send that email. Or you are overthinking the last conversation with your bestie. Or you start worrying about that big presentation you have to give at work tomorrow.  And before you know you, you're wide awake and feeling stressed out again.",
      "Introducing Banala\u00ae Sense \u2014 your sleeping device that uses the power of sound (isochronic sound technology) to help you get a good night\u2019s sleep, provide mental peace, and help you rest.",
      "First, the Theta Isochronic sound helps to slow your mind down and prepare you for sleep. Then, the Delta wave makes you experience an intense rest. In addition, the secret blend of other sound waves enables your body and mind to sync seamlessly with your natural sleep cycle and enjoy your continuous rest.",
      "Banala Sense is a patent-pending sleep-inducing device with ground-breaking, isochronic sound technology that not only helps you get to sleep faster but also encourages better quality sleep.",
      "Its proprietary Smart Sleep-Cycle-Inducing System starts with the Theta Isochronic tone to slow the chaotic brain activity, prepare you for the sleep state, and help you fall asleep quickly. Then, Delta Isochronic waves make sure you stay asleep for a longer time. At the same time, the secret blend of other waves ensures a peaceful rest.",
      "Regular usage of Banala Sense will positively impact your sleep cycle and gradually restore it. As a result, not only will you sleep better, but you'll also feel more rested and energetic during the day.",
      "If you want to focus on the project, relax from the long day, or just feel good, the Banala Sense is always there for you. With its four modes of operation and ground-breaking sound technology, you can customize it to meet your needs. Get the most out of your Banala Sense and enjoy a peaceful, stress-free life.",
      "You sit down to work on a project, and before you know it, you've wandered off onto Facebook or YouTube, completely losing your focus.",
      "Banala Sense's \"Focus\" button provides a blended sound frequency in the range of the Beta wave to help you to keep you on task, concentrated and productive.",
      "Between work, home, and everything in between, it seems like there is always something to get stressed about.",
      "The \"Relax\" button on your Banala Sense provides a blended sound frequency in the Alpha wave range to induce deep relaxation so you can let go of all that daily tension. Whether you're taking a break from work or just unwinding before bed, the Relax button will help you to achieve a state of calm and peace.",
      "You may feel like the world is looking brighter when you are in a good mood. And there's no better way to get there than pushing Banala Sense's \"Feel Good Button. \" The blended mixture of Alpha and Gamma sound waves ranges it emits helps to create a sense of joy and happiness,  boost creativity, and act as a natural anti-depressant.",
      "Listening to music is one of the best ways to relax and fall asleep. But what if your favorite tunes could also help you get a better night's sleep? With Banala Sense, you can now blend your favorite tracks with the isochronic sound frequency waves.  So, if you're looking for a good night's sleep, Banala Sense is the perfect solution.",
      "Operate:",
      "Isochronic tones is used for getting brain waves to sync with a specific stimulus. This stimulus is typically an audio or visual pattern. They are incredibly effective in improving sleep quality and helping people achieve better, more restful sleep.",
      "But, if you're struggling to get to sleep, your brain is likely producing too much Beta activity.",
      "Banala Sense, with its patent-pending Isochronic Tone technology, helps to reduce Beta activity and increase Delta and Theta frequency range. Thus, ensuring you experience a better, faster, and deeper sleep.",
      "Our brainwave activity reflects our mood. For example, if slower brainwaves are dominant, we feel sleepy, relaxed, or dreamy.",
      "Brainwave speed is measured in Hertz (Hz) and relates to the cycling movement per second. So a 5Hz brainwave simply means cycling at a five times per second rate. And Brainwave Entrainment Methods, like isochronic tones, stimulate and produce more brain activity of a specific frequency or range, making that more dominant.",
      "Theta waves occur from 4Hz to 8Hz. They usually happen in a state of deep relaxation or drifting in and out of sleep.",
      "Delta waves are very slow and low in frequency (0.5Hz-4Hz). You produce the most delta activity during your deepest sleep. During delta, your body does most of its healing and regenerating of cells.",
      "58% of individuals who used delta simulations every night within a month reported improved sleep quality and reduced fatigue.",
      "Banala Sense is our new product in the series of Banala, following Banala Lite and Banala Alarm Clock. Banala Lite and Banala Alarm Clock have proven their safety and benefits with 2,409 backers and over 50,000 users so far.",
      "Banala is natural and super safe for humans and pets. It can be used by everyone at every age and doesn\u2019t have any contraindications.",
      "The difference between Banala from other Brain Entrainment methods like Binaural Beat or electric brain-inducing is that the sound from Banala is natural. Banala uses isochronic sound technology, which is iso soundwave. Like the ambient noises in your room from the air conditioner or fan. Banala adds another natural soundwave to the room ambiance and instead of an un-organize soundwave like the one from the air-conditioner or fan, Banala emits a soundwave that is curated and researched to help people in the room sleep better. (and, of course, focus, relax, and feel good.)",
      "The technology was developed based on the academic thesis and academic paper that the founder, Kridsakon, studied and published in 2012. In Chulalongkorn University thesis and IEEE paper publication \u201c2012 Tenth International Conference on ICT and Knowledge Engineering,\u201c. This knowledge of Brain-Computer Interfaces and brainwaves allows Kridsakon to create his first product BrainPlus, the brain training using EEG, which is now used in various hospitals in Thailand\u2014helping people to fight dementia. The project has been funded by the \u201cTechnology and Innovation-Based Enterprise Development Fund\u201d and the \u201cNational Science and Technology Development\u201d.",
      "We all have different sleep needs and patterns, and it can be tough to get into a good sleep routine. But once you do, it makes a huge difference in your day-to-day life, repairing and restoring our bodies \u2014 like nature's way of rebooting us.\nA standard sleep pattern typically consists of five stages of sleep, each alternating between different cycles \u2014 the slow-wave and REM (paradoxical) sleep phases.\nStages one to two are light sleep, three to four are deeper sleep, and the fifth stage is REM sleep, often referred to as the rapid eye movement stage or the dream state.",
      "The estimated shipping date is October 2022. Due to the current volatility of shipping costs, we will calculate and collect shipping after the campaign ends, close to our ship date. We will collect your survey and shipping costs through BackerKit. This method will keep costs down since we\u2019ll know how many units are going to each shipping zone.\nWe expect the shipping prices per package to be $12 - $20. Please note that this is just an estimate, and the final shipping cost will be determined at the time of fulfillment in October.",
      "Banala Life is a company dedicated to helping people worldwide sleep better. Based on extensive and insightful research, we offer solutions that improve the well-being of our users. Our mission is to defeat insomnia once and for all.\nOur products, the Banala Alarm Clock and Banala Lite launched on Kickstarter in 2018 and 2019. We received over 2,500 pledges from those campaigns and have already shipped tens of thousands of products worldwide to over a hundred countries.\nWe have poured our hearts and soul into this project because we're passionate about ensuring everyone benefits from the healing powers of deep sleep. We hope you're excited to join us on this journey towards ensuring everyone sleeps better.\nOur trusted manufacturers are ready to start production and bring the first batch of Banala Sense to you as soon as the campaign ends.\nIf you would like to reach us, please email us at contact@banala.life.

      "As for angles, the camera can be at 30\u02da from your screen and it still auto-calibrates with no problem. This gives you more flexibility to leave the camera where it is most convenient to you, depending on the room and display you want to set it up at.",
      "This is exciting because V Board uses an advanced Projection Transformation algorithm that allows the camera to work at a wide angle range.",
      "When you see a screen from the side instead of straight on, it\u2019s not a perfect rectangle. V Board takes that distorted screen dimension into account to display the correct image that you intended to draw. Other products similar to V Board are simply not advanced enough to provide that same ease of use.",

      "At 3.7 inches, 440Carbon Black stainless steel, the BLITZ Pocket Knife is your last everyday carry.",
      "After the original B-2 Nano Blade raised nearly $450K in total funding last year, it went on to become the most funded pocket knife project in history. This time around we wanted to do something different by getting all of our original backers involved in the design process.",
      "We're extremely proud to introduce the newest addition to our B-2 Pocket Knife Collection - BLITZ, a SMALL pocket knife designed and created by all of our backers!",
      "Over the past year, we asked all of you to help us design and create the ultimate pocket knife together as a community of adventurers, creators, and designers through a series of surveys, updates, and emails. This included over 1,000 surveys from 22,000 original backers and over 10,000 data points analyzed to create the World's First \"Crowd-Designed\" Project.",
      "The B-2 Pocket Knife Collection was inspired by the notorious B-2 Stealth Bomber military aircraft.  The B-2 Bomber is notably the most advanced warplanes in history. Nearly 80 percent of the aircraft is made from woven composites that incorporated glass, carbon, and graphite fibers. Made of 440Carbon Black Stainless Steel, the BLITZ is a slightly bigger, slightly beefier, and ever so slightly... more badass.",
      "Based on your feedback, we incorporated these aspects of design into our new Bomber BLITZ Pocket Knife. Our new design is meant to be a chubby style knife. It's wider than a normal proportion of a standard knife. This allows the BLITZ pocket knife to be more durable and stronger in situations that require the use of force. It also gives a stronger grip to the user's hold. At only 3.7 inches, the BLITZ is small enough to conceal in any coin pocket. Its the first of its kind and we are absolutely sure you will love it!",
      "Dimensions  \n               UltraLight Weight: < 2oz \n               Length of Blade: 3.7cm \n               Thickness: 7cm Open Body Length: 9.5cm \n               Handle Length: 5cm \n               Materials (Blade and Body): 440Carbon Black Stainless Steel \n               Hardness: 58-60HRC (Rockwell Hardness Scale)\n               Color: Jet Black",
      "Tanto Blade - Many backers asked if we can incorporate a tanto blade into the new design. The blade has a high point with a flat grind, leading to an extremely strong point that is perfect for stabbing into hard materials. The thick point of the tanto blade contains a lot of metal near the tip, so it is able to absorb the impact from repeated piercing that would cause most other knives to break. Bonus: We are also able to utilize a serrated edge and straight edge.",
      "Small Size -  Discrete conceal-ability is the definition of the BLITZ Pocket Knife. The BLITZ is approximately 9.5cm or 3.7 inches in length. We wanted to keep it small enough to be fully-concealable (in coin pocket) and easy to carry on a day to day basis but also heavy duty like a full pocket knife.",
      "Blade - The BLITZ will have an oversize grip in width and blade which gives it a better handle for tactical use. This style of \"chubby knife\" is the first of its kind.",
      "Just like with the original B-2 Nano Blade, the BLITZ incorporates a non-serrated portion of the blade featuring a flat grind. The blade itself is very robust giving the BLITZ full tactical abilities despite its smaller form.",
      "440Carbon Black Stainless Steel - The entire body and blade of the Blitz will utilize 440Carbon Black Stainless Steel making the BLITZ one of the strongest pocket knives ever created by mankind. Rated at 58-60HRC (Rockwell Hardness Scale) the BLITZ is extremely tough and will stay sharp for longer periods of use. 440C is a highly durable and corrosion resistant stainless steel. The BLITZ can endure years of outdoor wear without extra maintenance to protect the blade from rusting.",
      "Bomber Signature Perforations - Many backers mentioned adding our signature 3 perforated holes into the blade. Perforated blades allow cutting and slicing of materials to not stick onto the blade itself. It provides a cleaner, sharper cut.",
      "Heavy Duty Screws - The BLITZ will utilize stronger and larger screws than the original B-2 Nano Blade. This allows the pivot point of the blade to absorb extreme impact or force meaning it will be more durable than ever.",
      "Urban Military Concept - All of our Bomber & Company products have a military design and tactical aesthetic. The BLITZ is engineered to hold durability and functionality to the standard of military-grade equipment. Vincent Pilot Ng (Lead Designer) has had over 10 years of professional experience in product design. He has brought about other renown products to markets such as the Bomber Barrel Duffle Bag, original B-2 Nano Blade, and Halo Belt.",
      "Legality - As a two-handed folding blade under 3 inches in length, it is technically legal worldwide. Please double check with your local customs to make sure the knife falls within local legal restrictions.",
      "Weight - The ultralight weight of the B-2 BLITZ TANTO STRAIGHT EDGE Pocket Knife comes in at less than 2oz making it one of the lightest, fully functional, 440C black stainless steel tactical pocket knife in the world.",
      "Folding/Locking: The BLITZ is both locking and folding. Safety was one of our main concerns when it comes to a knife of this size. We wanted the design to be suitable for beginners as well as intermediate knife experts. The lock is a lever rather than a push button. You can actually use the spine to scrape flint without the worry of it coming around when the blade is locked. This makes the knife design much more robust than traditional smaller blades which are just folding.",
      "When the BLITZ opens, the lever \"SNAPS\" into place to lock the blade from accidentally closing when in use. The user can feel and hear the tactile sound and click on the lock. To close, all you have to do is press the locking lever to open. Utilizing the latest manufacturing and engineering technology, we made sure to leave ZERO wiggle room.",
      "Over the past year, we have had several reiterations of prototyping as you can see below.  The first prototypes were designed out of aluminum casts and wood. After several months of collecting surveys and feedback, we added many more features including a quick access tab and even a thumb grip for better stability when in use. See the below pictures.",
      "All Bomber & Company products were originally designed for ourselves. We engineer everything under strict quality and durability standards. It is our promise to provide a Lifetime Warranty for the B-2 BLITZ TANTO STRAIGHT EDGE Pocket Knife. If it ever breaks, send it back to us and we will replace it free of charge!",
      "Examples of BLITZ Tanto Serrated Edge Pocket Knife usage:",
      "ABOUT US \nBomber & Company is an industrial urban product design company based out of San Francisco, CA USA with a mission to provide premium survival gear to the modern explorer.

      "Built by Morel, a leader in HiFi audio, this is the first true Hi-Fi speaker affordable for everyone",
      "The world\u2019s most DYNAMIC bluetooth Hi-Fi speaker - created by the leading HiFi acoustic design & engineering team at Morel.",
      "Two custom-made tweeters, a massive 6\u201d double magnet woofer, fully dedicated amps, and a custom-built DSP deliver POWERFUL, ENGAGING, ACCURATE sound that can fill up any room.",
      "True Hi-Fi has never been more accessible.",
      "Enjoy the detailed highs, crystal clear mids, and robust bass. Hogtalare offers an emotionally powerful listening experience that is deep and powerful yet very articulate. The lifelike, high resolution, dynamic sound quality creates an incredibly engaging listening experience.",
      "For bass, we use a HUGE double magnet 6-inch woofer with a reinforced cabinet to deliver an incredible deep bass sensation.",
      "For maximum resolution, Hogtalare is equipped with two \u00be\u201d soft dome tweeters, custom-made to our strict specifications and rigid sonic demands to create smooth and detailed sound.",
      "Each tweeter plays one channel (left or right), creating a true stereo experience with a full and vivid soundstage.",
      "In fact, Hogtalare has an incredible 36hz-20khz frequency range!",
      "3 Dedicated amps, one for the woofer, one for each of the tweeters, and a custom-built DSP gives you a clear, beautifully rich, powerfully dynamic sound from a compact package.",
      "Be amazed with Hogtalare\u2019s rich stereo sound, dynamic presentation and incredible clarity.",
      "We\u2019re Morel, and, for the last 45 years, we\u2019ve been creating high-end, high fidelity sound systems and speakers for people around the world. We love high-quality sound and music and only seek to make speakers that we ourselves enjoy, love, and want.",
      "With Hogtalare, we did what we do best - create amazing high-quality speakers. But this time, we added the technology and refined the process to make it innovative and affordable, while keeping the sound, quality, and craftsmanship absolutely perfect.",
      "We\u2019re proud of what we\u2019ve made and hope you\u2019ll love it too.",
      "The overall sound quality of a hi-fi system is determined by literally hundreds of aspects, from the quality of your power supply to the synergy between driver materials.",
      "The tech used to transmit your audio from your source is just one link in the chain (which is also affected by a lot of variables), and its effect on the result is only limited by how well it\u2019s implemented in the R&D process. This is exactly where Hogtalare shines!",
      "From a sonic perspective, Hogtalare was developed like an old school hi-fi speaker, and only then did we add power and connectivity, making sure that everything was tailor-made to our spec and needs.",
      "The result is an entire Hi-Fi system enclosed in a single box, designed with perfect harmony between all parts to ensure incredible sound. This is what Morel does best.",
      "To get Hogtalare to sound just right, we had to mix modern technology with old-school acoustic design doctrine. We integrated our high-end audio craftsmanship with our award-winning tech to give you the perfect sound at the perfect price.",
      "Hand craftsmanship and attention to detail are at the heart of the Morel production process. To produce loudspeakers that deliver that magical feeling, the human touch is an absolute necessity.",
      "Each Hogtalare speaker is carefully assembled and extensively tested to ensure that it meets the highest standards. Morel\u2019s four decades of experience and knowledge permeates in every detail of Hogtalare\u2019s engineering and design.",
      "This meticulous engineering process created an amazing self-contained HiFi system on par with some of the highest quality speakers ever.",
      "Good sound doesn't need a lot of power, it needs the right kind of power. That\u2019s why we designed Hogtalare\u2019s electronics from scratch, with dedicated built-in amplifiers, for the woofer and each of the tweeters, and a custom-built DSP unit to sync everything together.",
      "We used only the best acoustic technology and customized Hogtalare\u2019s electronics to work in perfect sync with the full system. Our dedicated veteran, award-winning acoustic engineers made sure every piece of technology worked in tandem with the hardware.",
      "Each piece was selected for sound quality first, instead of the glitz in getting the \u201clatest\u201d tech. This is why we chose Bluetooth 4.2 instead of Bluetooth 5 - it simply sounds better.",
      "We designed Hogtalare as a simple, clean square - a shape that is perfect from a sonic perspective while staying modern and beautiful.",
      "It also fits perfectly into an IKEA\u2019s Kallax/Expedit shelf unit, the most sold piece of furniture in history - with over 130 million units sold.",
      "We didn\u2019t just design Hogtalare to be beautiful - we made sure every piece of hardware was perfectly placed and engineered for optimal output. We carefully selected the materials for each component and positioned them exactly where they needed to be to create the clearest, most powerful sound possible.",
      "Each one of the drivers (woofer and tweeters) are specifically arranged to achieve their maximum resolution in relation to the cabinet and to one another.",
      "The cabinet is made from a thick wood compound with internal bracing and reinforcement to provide phenomenal sonic performance and insulation.",
      "To improve resolution with the grill on, we added waveguides (horns) to the frame, right above the tweeters. An EVA ring was also added to further improve resolution.",
      "The grill has a full fabric design. No holes, no cutouts, only beautiful simplicity. The grills come in a variety of subtle and vibrant colors to perfectly fit your home decor.",
      "In order to maintain functionality without compromising the clean aesthetic, we made backlit buttons that you can see and operate through the fabric.",
      "For those who want a 2 speaker stereo system, Hogtalare supports TWS (True Wireless Stereo) pairing. That means you can wirelessly pair two Hogtalare units. Each unit will only play one channel (left or right), and you will get a dual speaker stereo system with unrivaled performance in this price range.",
      "Hogtalare supports both BT (Bluetooth) and AUX (auxiliary) inputs.",
      "Wirelessly stream music from your phone, connect your TV or laptop, or hook up your turntable to spin some vinyl.",
      "Advanced Bluetooth 4.2 technology and aptX support give you the most optimal sound for range capacity.",
      "Even our BT chip was specifically selected for its superior sonic characteristics, and APT-X support drastically improves the compression process in comparison to regular BT to give you higher fidelity.",
      "Even in connectivity, we keep audio quality top of mind.",
      "For those who need a WiFi speaker, Hogtalare has a WiFi enabled USB power port on the back, so just plug your Chromecast audio or equivalent.",
      "Throughout the years, Morel has developed an enviable reputation for technological innovation and design excellence.",
      "Morel drivers, including tweeters, midrange, and woofers, are used in some of the most demanding, high-end products around the globe. Morel products and sound systems are sold in the home hi-fi, home theater, auto, and mobile audio markets worldwide.",
      "Our goal is to make HiFi sound accessible to everyone. For over 44 years, we\u2019ve been making some of the most advanced and high-quality hi-fi speakers in the world - we\u2019re bringing that same mastery to you.",
      "We took our expertise and put it all into one simple, well-designed, self-contained, high-value, incredibly priced speaker.",
      "Enjoy high-quality sound without compromising your home\u2019s aesthetic or breaking your budget.",
      "This is what a Hi-Fi System should be.",
      "In 1975, Meir Mordechai founded Morel. Inspired by a love of music and motivated by a dream, Mordecai sought to create a loudspeaker that would capture the magic in music in the most natural way.",
      "His life-long quest resulted in successive generations of speakers and audio drivers that consistently set new standards for superb sound quality.",
      "Over the years, Morel has developed an enviable reputation for technological innovation and design excellence. Morel drivers, including tweeters, midrange, and woofers, are utilized in some of the most demanding, high-end products around the globe.",
      "Morel products and sound systems are sold in the home hi-fi, home theater, and mobile audio markets in more than 55 countries worldwide and have won handfuls of \u201cBest of\u201d awards in various reputable trade and technology shows.",

      "Cables are a pain. They're always getting tangled up, lost, and in the way. But the worst is when you need to charge your phone and can't find a cable. Or when you're trying to use your phone as a stand, but the cable's in the way.",
      "If you're using a cable to charge your phone, you're stuck in one place. You can't use it to watch videos or play games. And most importantly, cables limit your ability to use your phone while it's charging.",
      "Media Talking About Volta",
      "Taking full advantage of MagSafe technology, VoltaGo works seamlessly with the iPhone 15 (Pro/Pro Max), all wireless charging iPhones & Smartphones (thanks to the Volta Mag Ring).\n\nSimply snap VoltaGo onto the back of your phone (be it the new iPhone 15 or any wireless charging smartphone) with perfect alignment every time, and you can get a quick and reliable power boost (7.5W high-speed magnetic wireless charging) that doesn\u2019t block your camera while you\u2019re on-the-go.",
      "No need for cables or precise placement. You can also enjoy total freedom with effortless detachment. Just ditch the wires and enjoy hassle-free magnetic wireless charging. \n\nNo need to sacrifice style over substance. Simply Snap your Phone onto the charging pad and enjoy the effortless charging experience.",
      "Wireless charging in a power bank isn\u2019t exactly a new idea, but we have made VoltaGo double as a charging stand as well. A foldable and adjustable kickstand on the back keeps it securely propped up while it\u2019s in use and also supports your Phone at a comfortable viewing angle according to your different needs.",
      "The kickstand is made of four rare-earth Neodymium magnets and can be adjusted to two angles. The structure of the VoltaGo kickstand is eligible for protection under a utility model patent.",
      "VoltaGo comes with strong N54 magnets that lock onto the built-in magnets of iPhone 12|13|14|15 series to provide a secure hold. No need to worry about power failure when charging your Phone with VoltaGo in your bag.",
      "The compact design is the key to its portability. VoltaGo is only around 68mm long and 17.2mm thick, making it sufficiently small for a pocket or bag.",
      "VoltaGo helps prevent an awkward cable from interrupting your grip. You can always enjoy a smooth and uninterrupted gaming experience.",
      "With the release of the iPhone 15 series on 14th Sep, it's proved that iPhone 15 models still adopt Magsafe technology. So VoltaGo is made with the iPhone 15 series in mind. With VoltaGo's future-proof design, you do not need to buy additional charging accessories for your new iPhone.",
      "VoltaGo delivers a powerfully fast energy to go (15W Max). Compatible with all Qi-enabled devices. Fast charge your AirPods with supported iPhone and Android devices at 5W, 7.5W and 10W power, respectively. Internal circuitry will automatically detect how much wattage your devices require, so there\u2019s no risk of damage.",
      "Introducing our Magnetic Ring, designed to effortlessly attach to the back of ANY PHONE, including Androids and older iPhones. This innovation grants your phone MagSafe capabilities, akin to the iPhone 12/13/14/15 series. Compatible with wireless charging-enabled phones, it doubles as a convenient Mag Stand accessory for your device.",
      "Equipped with a 20W PD USB-C port, VoltaGo can fast charge two devices simultaneously by utilizing both the wired and wireless options. VoltaGo will charge your Phone from zero to 50% in just 30 minutes through wired charging. It takes about 2 hours for VoltaGo to become fully charged.",
      "VoltaGo's reliable 10,000mAh battery holds its charge for when you need power most. VoltaGo is perfect for everyday use, which can fully charge an iPhone 15 Pro three times or the biggest Galaxy S23 Ultra Two times.",
      "As you accumulate more devices with different charging methods, what you really need is one VoltaGo for the lot.",
      "VoltaGo is equipped with circuitry that supports pass-through charging, allowing you to charge the power bank itself and your device at the same time. The pass-through feature would be very helpful when you do need to go mobile at the last minute, making you well prepared with a fully-charged power bank.",
      "VoltaGo has passed the FCC, RoHS 2.0, and CE\u2019s strict safety standards. It also has eight different types of protections, including overcharge protection, voltage protection, temperature monitoring protection, and more. It provides all-round protections that ensure safety for the device and its users.",
      "4-in-1 charging, 20W ultra-fast GaN tech, and much more. There really is no other power bank like this in the world. We designed it for Android and Apple users like you, who love their devices but have been waiting for a better way to charge.",
      "Now\u2019s the time to ditch the bulky chargers, go all in one, and finally simplify your Apple charging!",
      "In our laboratory at 77\u2109, our engineers conducted a charging test of the iPhone 15 (in airplane mode) from 0 using both the VoltaGo and Apple MagSafe Battery Pack. The chart illustrates that VoltaGo achieves significantly faster charging speeds, ensuring optimal and swift device charging.",
      "We have partnered with a high-tech Factory to develop these power banks. We did not hold anything back. They are made with the best and highest-quality materials. \nReleasing this power bank will be a dream come true because we have been at it since 2017 (see screenshots below). \n\n\n\n\n\nNow, we have decided to release the VoltaGo Mag Power Bank 10,000 mah to our existing customers at the Cost of Production. We are not going to make any profit on this. The retail price for an Original MagSafe 10,000 mah Wireless Power is around $80 (USD). \n \nWe are ready, as we've recently launched fulfilment hubs worldwide. We will fulfil your VoltaGo order from our USA, AU, EU, UK and Hong Kong Hubs (we meant it when we said we got you).",
      "To make sure this campaign goes smoothly without delays. The production and testing of the VoltaGo has been happening in the background. We are happy to share they are ready and currently assembling them. \n\nWe learnt a huge lesson from the delays we encountered with Volta Giga. Hence, we ensured we put resources into place to ensure the production of the VoltaGo commence before the campaign was launched.",

      "The advantages of Jollylook Auto:",
      "Vintage Design \u2013 The classic vintage-inspired design is striking and attracts attention from all who see it.",
      "Automatic - Auto exposure and flash make it easy to shoot and achieve great results.",
      "Precise focus control - Unlike most instant cameras, Jollylook Auto features precise manual focus control for sharper results at all distances.",
      "Foldout and Compact - Little bigger than a smartphone box, the Jollylook Auto fits into a jacket pocket or small bag with ease.",
      "Easy to use \u2013 With easy to follow instructions the Jollylook Auto can be used immediately and instantly.",
      "A striking display camera - Even when not in use the Jollylook Auto looks beautiful on the shelf!",
      "Fun to use - Jollylook Auto is a fun and interesting camera to use that teaches you more about photography while impressing your friends and creating amazing instant memories.",
      "Beautiful photos \u2013 Using Instax mini film you get 10 instant color or monochrome analog photos. Instax is the most reliable, affordable and long-lasting instant film available.",
      "Environmentally-friendly \u2013 The case of the Jollylook Auto is made from easily recyclable, biodegradable laminated wood fiber material.",
      "We created many designs of the Jollylook Auto camera...",
      "Until we achieved a final design that features a harmonious combination of shape and function that was easy to use, reliable and sturdy while retaining the vintage steampunk aesthetic we desired.",
      "Of course, for every test, we had to build a computer model and program the laser cutting machine, which was brilliantly managed by Artyom, our design and laser cutting specialist.",
      "Finally, we had a large-scale prototype ready.",
      "Then it was time to develop the shutter unit - we decided that automatic exposure with the ability to select your preferred aperture gave the photographer the greatest ability to achieve creative results in all light levels, while still ensuring well-exposed photos and ease of use for beginners.",
      "After the technical solutions and components were chosen and the electronic design was developed, prototypes of printed-circuit boards were manufactured, and the firmware for the flash was developed by our engineering team, comprising Andrey and Alexey.",
      "The second iteration of the board and the fifth iteration of the firmware suited us. We printed prototypes of the body and plastic parts of the shutter unit on a 3D printer.",
      "This process included many changes and improvements, and it was necessary to change the logic of the camera control and status indication and to make subtle design changes to facilitate ease of use and reliability.",
      "Also at the prototype stage, the problem of material selection was solved. We had originally planned to use lightweight plywood, but the complexity of processing and the need to use lacquers, solvents, and grinding added cost and risk that we chose not to take to ensure a more affordable product and fewer potential delays in manufacture.",
      "The wood-fiber material selected for the Jollylook Auto contains less glue than plywood and does not contain formaldehyde at all, features a surface that does not require additional processing, looks magnificent, and is easily able to be manufactured on our in-house laser cutter. The final finish has been further improved by laser cutting techniques used by Artyom which create a very attractive look to the cuts and enhances the overall appearance of the camera.",
      "The development unit was developed by us for the original cardboard Jollylook camera and has been proven to be a sturdy and reliable unit.",
      "Finally, 14 months after the development of the original concept, we're here looking for your support to bring this amazing and beautiful camera to life!",
      "You will be able to choose from 2 colors in the pledge manager:",
      "Photos shot with Jollylook Auto:",
      "In sunlight",
      "Our vision is to create exciting, fun to use cameras that feature striking design and offer creative photographic features not included in other affordable instant cameras.",
      "Our first camera, the cardboard constructed Jollylook Instant Camera did exactly that. However, over the course of its development and production, we experienced many issues, from problems with parts delivery from suppliers, material choice and reliability and critically, poor manufacturing quality control by our selected Chinese manufacturing partner.",
      "These issues resulted in us having to invest our personal savings and borrow further funds to continue to meet our obligations to backers. Production was moved from China to Ukraine, and a new manufacturing and assembly facility was created. The design of the Jollylook was improved to enhance reliability and employees were sourced and trained to assemble the new, improved Jollylook. Production of the new Ukrainian made cardboard Jollylook commenced in late January 2019.",
      "We learned significant lessons from the development of the first Jollylook, and have taken all of those lessons and incorporated them into the way we designed the Jollylook Auto. We have identified the best materials, suppliers of key parts, glues, assembly techniques and more, and have extensive experience with all of these materials and suppliers from making the original Jollylook. We are better placed today than at any previous time to bring the Jollylook Auto to fruition successfully, ensuring that these lessons learned at significant cost will assist us to fulfill all our obligations to backers of the Jollylook Auto in a timely manner.",

      "Create beautiful waves of color and light with Art & Science.",
      "In western astrology, the story of Pisces involves 2 fish (Venus and Cupid) that tie each other with a string to swim away from the mythological monster Typhon. I represent this story in my kinetic sculpture that uses a single nylon string bound between 2 motors creating beautiful standing waves.  As the string spins endlessly, it is illuminated by stroboscopic LED lights creating beautiful displays of colors and shapes that are both mesmerizing and therapeutic to look at.",
      "Lamp in Black color (Volcanic Lightning mode)",
      "I take advantage of 3 main scientific principles in this creation: Standing Waves, Persistence-of-Vision, and the Stroboscopic Effect.  As Wikipedia defines it:",
      "Lamp in White color (Tango mode)",
      "The LEDs strobe (turn ON and OFF) to illuminate the spinning string at regular intervals.  By capturing periodic points in time of where the string was and wasn't, it creates an illusion of the string taking on many different colors, or splitting into many strings, or dancing erratically, and many more effects.",
      "The string rotates 60-90 times per second and the lights strobe at specific intervals to create unique patterns",
      "Each lamp has been programmed with 11 different color patterns, each one vividly unique from the others:",
      "\"Northern Lights\" mode simulates auroras",
      "\"Tango\" mode creates 2 strings that dance together endlessly",
      "The lamp also generates a gentle draft current for circulating air around a small room.  A faint hum (similar to a small fan) surrounds the lamp as the string rotates 60-90 times per second creating a white-noise and ASMR-like ambiance.",
      "Table setting",
      "Taking into consideration the aesthetics, I\u2019ve designed it such that it fits in a variety of settings that can normally fit a traditional lamp.  At 16x6x6 inches, it's not too big nor too small to be placed in a bookshelf, on a nightstand, on a fireplace mantle, on a work desk, on a side table, as a centrepiece, in a cubby, in a reception area, etc.  The ambient light show illuminates the surroundings in an innovative way that is sure to draw eyes and start conversations in any setting.",
      "Headstand setting and random cycling of colors allows for a wide variety of ambient mood settings",
      "\"Pride\" mode creates a rainbow",
      "With the 2 aluminum dials, users can change color patterns and motor speeds. Users can also gently touch the rotating string disturbing the natural ebb and flow resulting in vastly different forms and shapes. The aluminum dials are available in black, silver, or copper at no extra cost.",
      "Black, silver, copper dial choices",
      "Feeling is believing",
      "The specifications are as follows (but do note they are subject to change over the lifetime of the campaign and manufacturing, but not by much):",
      "When man meets machine... potentially NSFW ;)",
      "Dual tone color caused by \"Volcanic Lighting\" mode",
      "When my first campaign, Aquarius, was created, I had already set up a plan on launching 11 more products (each one based off a Western Zodiac symbol).  I was reminded of a childhood toy which demonstrated the standing waves concept and thought to myself that it can be a fitting representation of the story of Pisces.  If anyone is curious, here's a look at the toy that inspired this (you might still be able to get one on eBay for about 100-200 USD if you're lucky):",
      "However, times have changed and technology has advanced significantly.  The original product did not use strobes, was not intended to be a lamp, had problems with string winding, was limited in the modes it provided, and was not home-decor friendly.  I adapted the idea into a product that can be situated in a home setting and also applied what I learned from Aquarius regarding stroboscopes.  The end-result was a kinetic sculpture that acts as an innovative lamp, a symbolic representation of Pisces, and a beautiful demonstration of art & science.",
      "APA102C LEDs, not the standard WS2812B LEDs as those cannot strobe fast enough to activate Persistence-of-Vision effects",
      "Freshly 3D printed ABS filament (prototype), final version will be injection molded",
      "Close-up of the 3D printed prototype",
      "Over the past year, I\u2019ve worked through countless iterations, prototypes, and tweaks to perfect it for hand-production. As the project is already funded, exposing it on Indiegogo will help spread it further into the hands of people all over the world to enjoy and appreciate the wonderful possibilities that art & science can create.",
      "Prototype hand soldering of electronics (Arduino Nano shown!). Final version uses a properly manufactured PCB.",
      "Some of the early prototypes (with the final one on the right)",
      "As the majority of funding has already been met on a previous crowdfunding platform (Kickstarter), the funds raised here will go directly to capital expenditure spending.  You can visit our campaign page on Kickstarter for how the funds raised there were used.",

      "Northern Circuits Inc. is a 100% Canadian corporation founded in 2017 by Stephen Co, a computer engineer by trade but a lifelong maker by heart.  I've designed and verified ASICs (Application Specific Integration Circuits) for hardware companies for over 10 years and continue to do so till this day.  Outside of that, I dabble with woodworking, metalworking, CAD, microcontroller programming, and more (anything to do with the maker scene).  My first crowdfunded project, the Aquarius Fountain Lamp \u2652, won MakerFestival 2018's Best In Show award.",
      "That's me after accepting the Best In Show award!",
      "I have company social media pages on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.  Feel free to Follow/Like to keep up to date with all my projects!",
      "I expect early deliveries to begin in February/March 2020 in several \"waves\".  As I assemble/test every single one in-house, I am limited by the number that I ship out per day.  This is preferable over shipping everything in one big batch as it delays the earlier backers in receiving their reward.",
      "This is the proposed timeline schedule which I will try my best to stick to:",
      "The above timeline is only an estimate and may be slightly earlier or slightly later.  Any changes to the timeline will be communicated promptly.",
      "Unstable waves can sometimes be created by nudging/touching the string",
      "I offer the standard Pisces Kinetic Lamp reward perk in your choice of black or white and your choice of AU/EU/US/UK wall adapter.  Each lamp comes with an extra set of replacement motors, extra string, wall adapter, user manual, and the lamp itself.",
      "I also offer a combined Aquarius and Pisces reward perk which will save significantly on shipping by combining the costs.  As a result, they will both be shipped in 1 large box instead of 2 separate packages.",
      "If you wish to build Pisces yourself, I offer a lower cost reward perk where all the digital design files are provided which include:",
      "Note that the digital reward tier has NO physical reward items, they are strictly files that you can use at your own discretion to build a personal version of Pisces (not for commercial).  If requested, I can sell sell any individual parts as necessary.",
      "Some backers may be presented with VAT/customs invoices of which I have no control over.  The packages will be declared as \"Novelty Art Sculpture\" so please check with your local post office for exact duty rates.",
      "If you were a previous Aquarius customer, you can share a picture or video of your lamp on social media and tag it with #aquariuslamp or #aquariusfountain to receive a $10 CAD rebate upon Pisces reward delivery.  The rebate will be in the form of PayPal and will be sent after confirming the social media posting.  All it takes is less than a minute of work to share your post to receive $10 CAD, easy!",
      "The effect is even visible in moderately lit rooms",
      "I'm currently a solo act (relying on help from my wife and 1.5 year old as much as possible!).  Because of that, you can expect that all communication comes directly from me.  I hope I can build a personable relationship with all my backers through constant communication, transparency, and responsiveness.  To have my backers experience the hypnotic, mesmerizing, visual sensations of Pisces is my goal and I will do my best to achieve that just as I did with my Aquarius backers.",

    "description": "World's first coffee ground pencil lead, inspiring creativity with natural brown hues and aroma!",
    "company_name": "ZIROBIO",
    "allParagraphs": [
      "World's first coffee ground pencil lead, inspiring creativity with natural brown hues and aroma!",
      "Every morning, millions of coffee lovers around the world enjoy their coffee, but this simple ritual leaves behind a significant amount of unused coffee grounds. Globally, we consume 3.5 billion cups of coffee daily.",
      "In fact, coffee waste is a type of organic waste, and research shows that over 11.8 million tons of coffee waste are produced globally each year. When decomposed in landfills, it releases a large amount of methane, significantly impacting the environment. Only 5% of the world's coffee waste is truly recycled.",
      "We are Hailey and Miles, a couple with a passion for coffee. As avid enthusiasts, we drink at least two cups daily and love creating innovative coffee drinks, like our summer favorite, the orange iced Americano. We enjoy using a moka pot to handcraft espresso, but we used to discard the used coffee grounds without a second thought. Last year, we became aware of the environmental impact of this habit and started exploring ways to transform discarded coffee grounds into valuable resources.",
      "In fact, coffee grounds are rich in cellulose and lignin, antioxidants, and lipids, making them an excellent candidate for converting into bio-based materials as a substitute for petroleum-based resources.",
      "We often dealt with coffee spilling on clothes, leaving brown stains, and cleaning the coffee pot often left our hands covered in grounds. This sparked an idea. Hailey, who has always loved drawing and designing, thought using spent coffee grounds as pigments for art would be fantastic. For any artist, having portable and easy-to-store materials is a dream, enabling creativity anytime, anywhere.",
      "Starting last year, we both fully dedicated ourselves to establishing Zirobio, an eco-friendly brand based on coffee ground recycling, and began developing a portable coffee ground pencil.",
      "After six months of countless experiments and scientific research, we are proud to announce the birth of GRIND Z! It is no longer just a crazy idea. It allows you to create with coffee anytime, anywhere!",
      "This is a 5.6mm pencil lead containing 20% recycled coffee grounds and other components like wax and adhesives. We aim to fully display the natural brown color of coffee grounds on paper without artificial colorants, even though the color is not very intense.",
      "It offers a unique texture, with each stroke containing natural coffee ground particles, creating a perfect vintage effect unlike any pencil you've ever used. The wax helps maintain the brightness and smoothness of the color during writing or drawing, preventing easy smudging or fading, much like an oil-based brown colored pencil.",
      "This is also what makes GRIND Z so special:",
      "It has a natural black coffee aroma, not artificial coffee fragrance, and you can even smell a hint of bitterness. Your creations will carry a subtle coffee scent, which is incredibly cool! It's like creating while drinking coffee, always inspired and never tired!",
      "GRIND Z can be conveniently used directly in your hand like a crayon, or inserted into a clutch pencil for use.",
      "Unlike traditional wooden pencils, it also emphasizes sustainability by eliminating the need for wood removal.",
      "We strategically chose the 5.6mm pencil lead size, and we also offer a custom high-quality 5.6mm clutch pencil. With an aluminum shell, it is lightweight, portable, and durable. It fits GRIND Z pencil leads perfectly and is compatible with any classic 5.6mm clutch pencil on the market. This thickness ensures the pencil lead is both durable and versatile.",
      "The 5.6mm pencil lead is thicker than traditional mechanical pencil leads, offering several advantages: quick refilling, durability, cost-effectiveness, and resistance to breaking.",
      "When used with a clutch pencil, it ensures balanced weight distribution, preventing the pencil from getting shorter and lighter over time. This makes it ideal for extended shading sessions, providing a comfortable grip and stable performance.",
      "The broader lead helps create more uniform shading. You can use a regular pencil sharpener or sandpaper to sharpen the lead, rotating the pencil to keep the tip sharp, or use the wider side of the lead. The varying thickness can produce a range of expressive line widths, suitable for different artistic needs.",
      "It performs well on various types of paper, making it suitable for different artistic applications.",
      "GRIND Z is perfect for sketching, quick drawing, and detailed illustrations. It is also suitable for writing slightly thicker text, making it ideal for note-taking and writing memos.",
      "Traditional pencil leads often contain graphite and synthetic colorants\u2014materials derived from non-renewable resources and manufactured through chemical processes. These substances can pose health risks; studies have shown that prolonged exposure to certain chemical and metallic substances can lead to skin absorption and accumulation, potentially causing allergic reactions or other more serious health issues.",
      "In contrast, GRIND Z introduces a revolutionary approach by using recycled coffee grounds as the primary component. By eliminating synthetic materials, we reduce potential health risks associated with chemical exposure. Coffee grounds are a natural byproduct, safe for skin contact, and promote a more sustainable environment by reducing waste and avoiding the use of harmful substances.",
      "GRIND Z Official Price: $12/6pcs/pack/",
      "Our initial experiments were conducted in our home kitchen, but they failed at first: the leads either couldn't form properly or were too hard, scratching the paper. This was frustrating, and we began to doubt whether this project was feasible.",
      "Two months later, we finally made a crude prototype of GRIND Z. Though it resembled a crayon, it could indeed write and wasn't prone to breaking. This gave us more confidence.",
      "With a prototype in hand, we started contacting professional R&D teams and looking for suitable factories. After discussions with over 30 pencil manufacturers, we confirmed our current collaboration team. Through three months of continual exploration and several product upgrades, we achieved the final version.",
      "Through process improvements, we achieved writing with 100% natural coffee color without artificial pigments. We believe that through continuous research and improvement, our next-generation products will only get better.",
      "Our recycled coffee grounds come from a coffee factory in Asia, but we hope to collaborate with more coffee shop brands and factories worldwide to collect discarded coffee grounds and give them new life. We also hope this crowdfunding campaign will bring more orders and partners.",
      "If Zirobio continues to succeed, we will keep developing new products and collecting coffee grounds, all of which require significant costs. Choosing GRIND Z is not just choosing a pencil but also contributing to reducing the environmental burden of coffee grounds. This method of using recycled materials reduces waste accumulation and eases the environmental impact during production. Furthermore, by supporting sustainable products, each user actively supports the future of the planet.",
      "By supporting GRIND Z, you support innovation and environmental conservation, becoming part of this change. We invite you to join us on Kickstarter to support GRIND Z and help us use art to make the Earth a better place!",

      "Mel Dixon\u2019s two children, Tom and Rosie, have a devastating neurodegenerative condition so rare it doesn\u2019t even have a name. There is no approved treatment. But researchers at top UK universities are developing one. The science is promising \u2013 but there\u2019s no funding to run a trial.",
      "Why? Because big drug companies don\u2019t see enough profit in rare diseases like theirs. So nothing happens.",
      "That\u2019s where Patient Powered Research comes in. We\u2019re building a new system \u2013 one that gives patients, families and supporters a clear, ethical way to help fund neglected treatments and unlock the cures pharma won\u2019t touch.",
      "We\u2019ve done it once. Now we\u2019re building a platform to do it again \u2013 and again.",
      "We\u2019re not asking you to fund a trial today.",
      "We\u2019re asking you to help build the system that makes those trials possible. We need six months funding to get going.",
      "Your donation will help us:",
      "In other words, we are asking you to help us kickstart this project so we can lay the foundations now and unlock forgotten cures for patients for years to come.",
      "Every year, life-changing treatments for rare diseases are shelved in laboratories \u2013 not because they don\u2019t work, but because there\u2019s no money to test them in real patients.",
      "Examples include:",
      "These aren\u2019t fringe ideas. They\u2019re peer-reviewed, lab-tested, and sometimes even proven in animals. But they fall into what scientists call the Valley of Death \u2013 the space between discovery and treatment \u2013 because no one is willing to pay for the trials.",
      "But we are.",
      "We\u2019re building a platform that connects unfunded research with the people who need it \u2013 ethically, transparently, and under expert oversight.",
      "We call it Patient Powered Research. It\u2019s a way for patients or families to help fund clinical trials for neglected treatments \u2013 and potentially take part in them, if they qualify \u2013 while still respecting ethics, safety and scientific integrity.",
      "We\u2019ve published the model in the Journal of Medical Ethics, and the BMJ Open. It\u2019s been covered by The Financial Times, The Daily Mail, The Guardian and The Daily Telegraph.",
      "And it\u2019s been backed by ethicists, scientists and institutions including:",
      "In 2012, we used a version of this model to raise \u00a31.5 million in just eight months to fund a clinical trial in Sweden.",
      "The Financial Times called it:",
      "\u201cThe most successful medical crowdfunding campaign in internet history.\u201d",
      "And the lead researcher on that trial said this:",
      "\u201cAlexander and Dominic are probably the two most knowledgeable individuals when it comes to understanding how patients and their relatives and friends can influence medical research. Their idea to use crowdfunding to raise money for helping our promising medication into a clinical trial for cancer patients was highly successful and 12 patients have been treated so far. Their relentless work brings hope to individuals wishing to help but not knowing exactly how.\u201d",
      "\u2014 Professor Magnus Essand, Gene Therapy Researcher, Uppsala University",
      "Now we\u2019re ready to build the full system and make it work again \u2013 for families like Mel\u2019s and many more.",
      "Most rare diseases don\u2019t attract big money. There\u2019s no profit, so there\u2019s no progress.",
      "But these treatments often have wider potential. Tom and Rosie\u2019s condition, for example, is linked to protein and fat transport in cells \u2013 a process that\u2019s also involved in Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, epilepsy, and more.",
      "By helping rare disease families, we might unlock answers for millions",
      "This November, we\u2019re bringing together scientists, ethicists, and patient advocates at the Brocher Foundation in Geneva \u2013 Europe\u2019s leading bioethics institute \u2013 to finalise the model and get it ready to scale.",
      "This is the first time patients and non-academics have been invited to run a workshop at Brocher. It\u2019s a major step in making our platform work in the real world \u2013 with real safety, oversight, and support.",
      "We\u2019ve worked unpaid for over a decade to bring this idea to life \u2013 and we\u2019ve built the relationships, research base, and public support to take it to the next level.",

With the touchscreen you can also sharpen the image right on the screen.

Look at them through a high resolution 180-degree flippable touchscreen that you can adjust so you can appreciate the universe in comfort.  But there is absolutely no compromise on image quality because the integrated AI improves image quality with color correction, color difference, WDR, MCTF, noise reduction, anti-shake technology and dehazing of everything you see through your telescope.",

The aperture alongside the focal length also gives you 29x zoom capabilities, bringing the reaches of outer space to you. Get crystal clear images of every bit of light that emanates from the universe and see it all in high resolution.",

The remote control lets you snap shots and record videos as you sit comfortably in your chair late at night. \n\nEliminate the possibility of shaking hands disturbing the image you worked so hard to get.",
      "Unlike other telescopes the Beaverlab TW2 is both highly capable and easy to transport. The whole telescope weighs less than 4 kilograms (8 pounds) and is made to be portable. With the TW2 you get a high resolution telescope, 5 inch touchscreen that is designed to be portable. \n\nAttach the legs for the tripod and you now have a new set of eyes that can see into deep space everywhere you go.",

Take magnificent photos of animals such as birds, mammals and reptiles, in their natural habitats of mountains, forests and deserts. When you go back to civilization, witness the cityscape through the lens of your TW2 and capture the cityscape.",

      "Sway in the Largest Hammock on the Market - Sustainably Handmade - Empowering Women in Thailand",
      "Yes, one or two people can go off hammocking by themselves. But what of hammocking with ALL of your friends? Scoop up the dog! Invite the mailman! BaseCamp is a hammock experience for extroverts. String it up at a picnic! Bring it to the park! Fill it up at farmers markets, summer camps, beach parties, camping trips, anywhere that people gather and connect.",
      "HOW'S THE WEATHER OVER THERE? ...it's not always possible to hang multiple hammocks close together.",
      "Get your feet off my face ...two people per hammock is limiting in a group and can be a bit too snug.",
      "Who brought the ratchet? ...platform hammocks and tents hold more people but are heavy, less portable, and require tools.",
      "The higher you hang the farther you fall ...Stacking hammocks can be inconvenient and dangerous.",
      "Like beards, BIGGER is just BETTER when it comes to hammocking! You have more space. You can fit more people. BaseCamp only weighs as much as a box of wine (56oz) and is the size of a watermelon. Yet it holds 550lbs!",
      "3 full grown burly men OR",
      "4 recently reconciled opposing teammates of a beer pong tournament OR",
      "5 glittery girls with flowers in their hair OR",
      "6 middle school students and all of their angst OR",
      "Too many kindergartners!",
      "Our hammocking community is empowering women and their families in Northern Thailand. We are a small operation, employing a team of seamstresses making each hammock by hand from the comfort of their own homes. No mass factory manufacturing, no child labor, and no outsourcing...we operate completely in-house!",
      "We focus on cottage-construction techniques rather than mass factory production. The result is superior craftsmanship and a ripple effect of positivity and empowerment. Good vibes from our community to yours!",
      "Featured In:",
      "See how to hang the 1 & 2 Person Hammocks",
      "And the new kid on the block...",
      "Adjustable webbing tree straps",
      "Flying Squirrel Outfitters is a small camping hammock manufacturer working to create positive social impact by helping the world relax!",
      "We operate in a small garment manufacturing village in Thailand where seamstresses generally work in factories that recognize minimum wage laws. However, some women are physically unable to work in factories or simply can\u2019t leave home for 10+ hours each day. Some local garment manufacturers will hire stay-at-home seamstresses knowing they can pay exceptionally low wages almost unnoticed \u2013 sometimes paying as little as 8 cents per pair of pants sewn, well below Thailand's legal minimum.",
      "Flying Squirrel Outfitters strives to break this cycle of limited opportunity by creating jobs that are sustainable, location and schedule flexible, and fairly compensated. At-home hammock making has become a growing source of income for our team of seamstresses and their families. As our company grows, we look forward to expanding these opportunities for more women in the village.",
      "Rest easy in your hammock knowing that the hands that made it are thriving as a result of its creation.",
      "Hi, I\u2019m Brian. Four years ago I quit my comfy job in Seattle, sold my stuff, and headed abroad seeking something new. While traveling, I fell in love with Chiang Mai, Thailand and decided to sink some roots. I began working with local seamstresses, making travel hammocks for tourists. What started as an idea became an experiment and grew into a passion project called Flying Squirrel Outfitters.",
      "I\u2019m inspired by travel and the outdoors. Seeking lush natural beauty has guided me through many stages of my life, including the move to Thailand. I am also inspired by \u2018do good\u2019 companies that are defined by their impact. They challenge the status quo and raise standards of quality and compassion. Flying Squirrel Outfitters combines my love of the planet with my love of the people on the planet.",
      "I have a background in marketing and sales at a prominent startup in Seattle. I have personally been managing the Flying Squirrel team and operations for the past year and a half. It has been a wild ride and an enormous learning experience with lots of good vibes along the way.",
      "We are enticed by the vision of GIANT hammocks hanging all over the world. We are asking for help because our small company doesn't yet have the capacity to launch such a capital-intensive new product alone. The hammocks purchased in this campaign will allow us to buy materials in bulk and offer more opportunity to our team of seamstresses. One small step for the hammocking community, one GIANT step for Flying Squirrel Outfitters!",
      "If you are not into hammocks ...what's wrong with you? Just kidding, We are sure you have your reasons (childhood trauma from being forgotten in a hammock on a family vacation?). But you can still help!",
      "Sharing our campaign page with your friends is massively helpful!",
      "If we don\u2019t reach our goal, we absolutely will fulfill all items ordered.  There may, however, be delays depending on what is possible with the amount we raise. We will keep you updated and promise quick and clear communication.",
      "In the case that we do reach our goal (fingers crossed!), there will still be risks and challenges. We have been in business for over a year, we are not so idealistic that we are not prepared.",
      "In either case, we are committed to getting this right, that's a promise! In the name of preparation, here are a few risks and challenges that we've already thought of:",
      "Manufacturing Delays",
      "\u2022 We've already done large production runs before so we're confident in our seamstresses and team to continue to follow our finely oiled production line; however, securing the material from our sources can have unforeseen setbacks, but generally not.",
      "\u2022 We stay in constant communication with our team from prototype to production to assure the highest quality end product.",
      "\u2022 We always work on-site with our seamstresses for new products to resolve any challenges quickly and efficiently.",
      "Shipping Delays",
      "\u2022 We exclusively use DHL Express when shipping from Thailand which offers us the lowest cost per piece we could find at our modest sales volume. They have been tried and true so we believe we should continue to receive the same level of service.",
      "\u2022 We will do our best to ship to the earliest backers first!",
      "Lost Packages",
      "\u2022 We\u2019ve had some experience shipping products internationally, which means we know things can get lost. Again, we believe DHL will continue to provide the highest level of service in the event of a missing package - no worries, we\u2019ll make it right!",

      "The Wireless Presenter with air mouse and rich interaction function to boost efficiency&productivity",
      "You know, the 1990s brought advanced computers (at the time), as well as very practical laser pointers... and that was great and super useful, but 21st century\u2019s LCD/LED display equipment that is now used in meeting rooms, classrooms and lecture halls has made laser pointers entirely outdated and no longer suitable for today\u2019s technology.",
      "That\u2019s why we are dedicating to develop the PureMark presenter, The Wireless presenter with visual recognition technology of AI Era, that allows the indicator to be shown clearly on any display devices for all your public speaking needs.",
      "That\u2019s what the PureMark presenter stands for. Using FPGA-based image processing technology and visual recognition positioning technology, PureMark presenter has the same pointing directivity that laser pointers offer, but it can be used on any display devices. Also it comes with a wealth of interactive functions, such as key content Pointing and Marking, Zooming features for details, and Easy-to-use air mouse, so that all your presentations are lively, engaging, easy to control and fluid, all from your PureMark presenter.",
      "The PureMark presenter provides seamless switching of pointing, marking, zooming and air mouse functions, which makes the speaker completely away from the computer and makes the speech more fluent and exciting.",
      "When the PureMark presenter points to the screen, the built-in camera takes photos, then analyzes the photos to determine the location of the PureMark presenter pointing to the screen and display the cursor at that location, so that the PureMark presenter has the same pointing directivity as the laser pointers.",
      "The pointing experience of the PureMark presenter is the same as that of laser pointers, its pointing indicator is always displayed in the pointing position, and it can still keep good pointing while swinging rapidly and widely. When the PureMark presenter points to out of the display area for more than 1 s, the pointing indicator will disappear automatically. The pointing indicator with intelligent multi-level anti-shake makes the speaker more confident.",
      "The advantages of the image processing engine based on FPGA are: good real-time operation, no need to install any software, no limitation of operating system and application software, simple and easy to use.",
      "When you use the PureMark presenter to lecture with a wireless projection device, you can really appreciate the advantages of real-time operation: no delay, no breaking, no tail... everything goes smoothly. This is a wireless presenter that never fails you",
      "PureMark presenter is a real Plug & Play device, so you don\u2019t need any software to install and run it. As long as your device supports HDMI, just plug it to your device, and you\u2019re ready to use it to your heart's content.",
      "That\u2019s also why we designed it to work with any projector, TV screen or LED screen that has an HDMI input. If your display device doesn\u2019t have one, you can still use PureMark presenter by simply using an HDMI adapter that allows you to work with a different input that transfers the data into an HDMI platform. The PureMark presenter supports standard HDMI protocol and is compatible with any operating system, such as Windows, Mac, Android, etc. The PureMark presenter can be work with any application, such as PowerPoint, Keynote, Prezi, Browser, Desktop and just about any other software you may prefer to use.",
      "Proprietary 2.4 GHz communication protocol has robust anti-jamming ability and works well in the range of 30 m, so that the speakers can move freely without PC restrictions",
      "That\u2019s another key ingredient that we couldn\u2019t leave out of this equation. PureMark has a built-in rechargeable battery that does not only offer great performance and long times continuous speeches but which also charges quickly so that it\u2019s ready to go as you approach a new presentation.",

      "Introducing the first consumer dosimeter designed to accompany 24/7 and easily fit in your pocket.",
      "Our human body is subject to nuclear radiation, everywhere and at any time. It even can affect our health. Do you know that radiation in a plane is up to 100 times higher than on earth as it brings us closer to space?",
      "Do you know that food or any kind of material is radiating with different intensities depending on its composition or contamination in its previous environment?",
      "Our human challenge is that we cannot see or feel radiation. How about having a third eye that provides a view of the invisible?",
      "Doze is the world\u00b4s first dosimeter of its kind designed for consumers and fits perfectly in your pocket.  It measures only 59 x 34 x 13 mm (2.32 x 1.34 x 0.51 inches), and features a built-in Geiger counter tube specialized in detecting \u03b2 and \u03b3 radiation. It weighs less than 35 grams.",
      "It displays the radiation rate of your environment or specific objects whenever and wherever you want. You can keep it in your pocket and let it measure your daily radiation dose. Let it be your lifeguard, alerting you whenever radiation levels or the measured dose are abnormally high and potentially harmful.",
      "Each measurement of radiation produces a typical click sound and is also indicated by a flashing LED, which can be independently switched on or off. This means that the higher the radiation, the more Doze will click and flash.",
      "Doze is designed to be with you at all times. With a battery life of up to one year, you don't have to worry about losing functionality during your daily life. You can easily charge it through its USB-C socket, and you can also use it to upload your fully self-programmed firmware. More information is provided below.",
      "After 1100+ backers on Kickstarter, we are happy to re-launch this campaign on Indiegogo.",
      "Portability\nThe compact size of Doze makes it simple to carry and easy to use in various locations. You can even attach it to your keychain, allowing it to work as your lifeguard in the background.",
      "Discreet Monitoring\nDoze is almost invisible, you can discreetly monitor radiation levels in sensitive situations without the need to carry a bulky device.",
      "Versatility\nDoze is usable in various environments, such as your home, your workplace, on travels and all kinds of outdoor settings. All for your personal safety and environmental monitoring.",
      "Real-time Results\nThe immediate readings allowing Doze users to quickly assess radiation levels in their environment where ever it may be.",
      "Food Safety",
      "Doze can be used to monitor the safety of a wide range of food products, including vegetables, fruits, seafood, meat, and packaged goods.",
      "Public Health Assurance \nUsing Doze can enhance consumer confidence in food safety by ensuring that the products meet safety standards regarding radiation exposure.",
      "Life Guard \nWith Doze you can define your personal alarm dose rate and dose. As soon this maximum is reached, a visible and audible alarm will apply. Doze keeps you safe on sudden extraordinary situations.",
      "Durability\nThe compact design of the case is built to be with you every day. Doze\u00b4s cover is not only high quality but also 3D-printable, giving you the opportunity to add your personal touch.",
      "Whether logos, designs or individual texts \u2013 we offer you the flexibility you need to design your case according to your wishes. Feel free to make adjustments to ensure the final product is exactly how you envisioned it.",
      "The operating manual shows the functions of Doze with the current version of its firmware. It provides all typical functions of a standard Geiger counter and dosimeter. And if you are into programming, don\u00b4t forget: Doze allows you to upload your self-made firmware with its USB-C socket.",
      "Do you want to personalize your alarm dose rate or alarm dose? Below, you will find some typical values for your consideration.",
      "Doze sets new standards compared to other Geiger counters on the market. Thanks to its compact size, it is not only extremely space-saving, but also particularly handy - ideal for use in various applications.",
      "In addition, it impresses with its lower weight, which significantly improves handling and mobility. Another outstanding feature is the impressive battery life. Our innovative technology allows you to use it longer without interruptions, making it more efficient and safe.",
      "We also offer full programmability, allowing users to customize the product and tailor it optimally to their needs. Doze is powered by a power-saving microcontroller (ATtiny167) with an external 16 MHz clock. The microcontroller is connected to three buttons, one LED (which can be switched on or off), and a buzzer driven by the internal PWM generator. Its flexibility ensures that you can always achieve the best possible outcome for yourself.",
      "For those who see Doze not just as a daily companion but also as a platform for creativity, we have exciting news! We are making Doze programmable and providing full access to its firmware code and the files for its 3D cover model. You can easily use the USB-C socket on Doze to upload your customized firmware or transform it into a game console.",
      "Change and 3D-print the cover by yourself. Doze is open to your unique creativity.",
      "The first prototype has already been successfully tested and fully functional. We are currently concentrating intensively on the development of the new and final design.",
      "An important pending step is the programming of Doze and we change from a Micro USB to a USB-C socket. We also test different materials to determine the optimal housing. We are confident that we can complete this work on time.",
      "Our goal is to send the Doze to our supporters no later than six months after the end of the campaign.",
      "The world today is facing major challenges. Nuclear contaminated objects, reactor disasters and the permanent nuclear threat from political actors are just a few scenarios.",
      "We wondered why there isn't a small rechargeable tool that can always be with you and that warns you when you are facing high radiation. Why are the vast majority of devices huge and expensive? Why is their battery time mostly limited to a few hours?",
      "This sparked our inventive spirit and we started developing Doze. Be it for use in the industrial, private or hobby sector. A gadget to test radiation easily and everywhere without owning a bulky and expensive device.",
      "We find it exciting to promote technological developments and to present the market with what is probably the most functional while portable Geiger counter with display in the world.",
      "Wekos is a small but dynamic team of German technology enthusiasts from Berlin who are desperate in various fields. Our passionate mission is to develop technical innovations cost-effectively for the masses. Our group of creative minds, consisting of engineers, designers and entrepreneurs, has already launched numerous projects in recent years.",
      "Although not all of our ideas have reached market maturity, our team has learned from each experience and has not been discouraged. The belief that technology should be accessible to everyone drives us to find solutions that are both innovative and economically durable.",
      "Our passion and commitment is unbroken. We meet together regularly to exchange ideas, develop prototypes and refine concepts. Each new project is approached with the same enthusiasm that we felt when we first took our first steps into the world of technical innovation.",
      "This is our second funding for this project and our first time on Ingiegogo. We appreciate your support and are always available if there are any questions.",

      "GyroSpeed has its limitations, but we want to be transparent with our customers about how it works.",
      "Unlike some other ball speed measurement devices, GyroSpeed does not measure the speed of the ball directly. Instead, it predicts the speed based on the acceleration of the arm and the angular velocity of the gyro sensor.",
      "This means that the predicted speed may not always match the actual speed of the ball.",
      "For younger players with shorter arms, GyroSpeed may predict higher speeds due to the rapid changes in angular velocity during their swings. However, this can still be a useful tool for training as it provides a baseline for players to improve upon.",
      "If your child's predicted speed is already high enough, then it's important to focus on training that strengthens their lower body, improves the balance of their upper and lower body, and adjusts their arm angle. By doing so, your child can improve their skills and gain confidence in their abilities.",
      "Novice users may also experience discrepancies between the predicted speed and the actual speed of the ball if they are pushing or throwing the ball rather than swinging it properly. This can be an indication of issues with the user's arm swing and should be used as a learning opportunity to improve technique.",
      "By understanding the difference between the predicted and actual speeds, users can identify areas for improvement and work towards refining their technique for better performance.",

      "Do note, that these devices are only intended for use with clear water and that the volume of the container will determine the correct use of the UV wand (including time of immersion and the requirement to stir the water).",
      "We developed our UV snap-in module in response to requests from the hundreds of outdoor activists who we surveyed, many of whom are familiar with the safety and efficacy of using handheld UV devices, such as the Steripen\u2122 (which is the gold standard and the basis for our functional specifications). The owner of Steripen is Katadyn, a long-established Swiss company specializing in water treatment at all scales. We do not have a formal relationship with Katadyn, (or its Steripen subsidiary).",

      "The LIFESABER personal energy generator represents a technological revolution in efficiency and comfort. Our unique blend of patent-pending mechatronics enables even a child to generate the power they need in an emergency.",
      "The multi-jointed, telescoping handle of the LIFESABER enables a full 5 degrees of flexibility which accommodates the natural motion of the hand, wrist and forearm. In contrast, the crank of a typical manual generator is short and inflexible. This means that all the work has to be done by the wrist \u2013 which is awkward and quickly becomes tiring.",
      "The weighted grip at the end of our handle permits this swing arm to be 'twirled' much like the motion of a jump rope. This is a very comfortable activity which kids can sustain for hours on the playground.",
      "Alternatively, the extended handle can be gripped for power-cranking, putting the strength of the entire arm to work.",
      "Which brings us to our unique and essential force-multiplier technology.It stands to reason that you can overcome much greater resistance (torque) while cranking than when twirling.",
      "With the LIFESABER, the user can electronically (rather than mechanically) set the resistance (think gearing) to suit the mode (twirl vs. crank) and to match the person's strength. The higher the force multiplier setting, the more work will be accomplished during each rotation (and the faster you will generate electricity).",
      "That's why we expect that it will require a typical person (even a child) 15 minutes to generate a Quick Charge of 900 joules at the lowest resistance setting, while only 3 minutes of power cranking will produce the same results at the highest resistance setting. You can think of our proprietary technology as a kind of distant cousin to regenerative braking.",
      "We created the LIFESABER as a potentially life saving tool for:",
      "Ideation on the high-level spec for what was originally called the Personal Energy Generator (PEG) began more than 5 years ago. The challenge was to create a self-charging device that even a child could use to generate lifesaving power, but which would be ergonomically efficient for use by even the strongest adults. Of course, the device would also have to be compact, affordable, lightweight and wilderness-friendly.",
      "After 3 years and dozens of false starts and dead ends, I had an epiphany which led to the first of the technical breakthroughs which would be required. Specifically, development of a swing arm that could both be twirled (like a jump rope) yet comfortably cranked.",
      "The resulting PowerGrip\u2122 was successfully prototyped in July of 2018, which featured a telescoping arm with a weighted handle for twirling. It also served as the handle grip while for cranking. We created a unique, multi--jointed design which enables an unprecedented 5 degrees of freedom in the arm\u2019s motion. This results in comfortable, sustainable twirling or cranking while bringing to bear the full forearm strength of the user.",
      "But while necessary, the PowerGrip was not sufficient in order to realize the ambitious product objective. It took hundreds of additional hours to prove-out the second breakthrough technology \u2013 a dynamically adjustable torque control achieved solely through electronics (no mechanical gearing).",
      "In June of this year we completed our most advanced working prototype, enabling the user to toggle the \u2018Force Multiplier\u2019 circuit to match the rotation-resistance to the type of input (twirl vs. crank) and the strength of the user.",
      "This sophisticated prototype was privately demonstrated \u2013 to real acclaim \u2013 at the Outdoor Retailer show in Denver. While functional, none of our existing prototypes are optimized for manufacturability, which is why we've come on Kickstarter!",
      "I have many successful products on the market. The folks who backed my Lil Trucker Kickstarter campaign were pleased with the tools I delivered. In the risks/milestones section of the campaign page we detail the years of work to get to this point where we've demonstrated the crucial technologies - including the 'force multiplier' system.",
      "I have a colleague with a PhD in electrical engineering who has run all of the development and testing of the patent-pending circuitry. We are very confident in the physics/electronics as well as mechatronics overall.",

      "Sitting all day in the office can be stressful to both your body and mind. A quick switch to standing not only helps you relax the cervical spine and spine a bit but also refreshes your creative mind.",
      "When you are standing, Maxtand 2.0 offers a natural height for your palms to rest onto the laptop, and your eyes to look at the screen with no strain or tension.",
      "Surely, you would sit back after a short break. Does Maxtand 2.0 stop after that? Absolutely not. The adjustability of Maxtand 2.0 provides endless possibilities to fit your work while sitting.",
      "The Multi-angle design makes Maxtand 2.0 the ONLY sit-stand laptop holder that you can use on a desk.",
      "Use it outdoors",
      "Your best partner",
      "A small bookholder",
      "When the Maxtand 2.0 is fully deployed, it can be freely adjusted from 4.3 CM to 38.8 CM (Slim is 3.8 CM to 38.3 CM). No matter how much you need for height, Maxtand 2.0 can meet all your needs. It allows your spine to stretch at work.",
      "After receiving all the suggestions from our crowd funders, we upgraded the construction of Maxtand 1.0. Maxtand 2.0 has the same 3-pivot design as its predecessor but 24 teeth each gear. (Slim has 18 teeth).",
      "Now Maxtand 2.0 can adjust 15 degrees each time (Slim is 20 degrees).  It's more compatible with most people's usage habits.",
      "Why did we choose aluminum alloy for Maxtand 2.0?",
      "The density of aluminum is about one-third of steel. It can greatly reduce the weight of Maxtand 2.0. Its corrosion resistance and long service life.",
      "We use steel as the material of gear. It has strong hardness. And we can replace steel gear with Brass gear for a better metal texture. (Stretch goal)",
      "We recommend using the Aluminum C-clip that came with Maxtand 2.0. C-Clamp allows Maxtand 2.0 to be fixed to most materials such as glass or wood.",
      "C-Clamp can replace aluminum with Brass for a better metal texture. (Stretch goal)",
      "To get a higher monitor viewing angle with the alternative VESA mount (add-on option).",
      "With the LED clamp, Maxtand 2.0 can be your table lamp on your desk (add-on option).",
      "Besides less sitting time, standing at work has other benefits:",
      "We are Creatio, a team of passionate engineers, designers, and creative folks who care deeply about the future and are committed to making work and life become healthier and more efficient.",
      "Since starting Creatio, our mission has been to bring the world\u2019s best laptop stand to as many people as possible. Three years ago, we introduced the Maxtand 1.0 on Kickstarter and you helped launch our vision into reality. With the increasing demand for home office under the epidemic, we have discovered more significance of Maxtand",
      "After receiving feedback from thousands of lovers and two additional years of R&D, we launched the next generation, the Maxtand 2.0.",
      "Thank you for your support along the way. This is our fifth project since Rmour Stand. We hope to continue providing exciting new products to our supporters.",

Once we hit our funding goal, we\u2019ll immediately start production. Backers can expect their AirNEST to ship within 6 months. We\u2019ll keep you updated every step of the way with regular progress reports.",

      "The Jump Hour Watch That\u2019s Cooler Than Your Time Machine",
      "WHY SVALBARD?",
      "Since 2017, Svalbard Watch has been the global leader in making watches that break all the rules, and break in to the hearts of collectors and enthusiasts worldwide. With over 150 unique, unconventional models launched since our start, we\u2019ve earned a reputation for creativity, quality, and just a little bit of watchmaking madness.",
      "We\u2019re a private multinational company with offices in the USA, UK, Cyprus, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Our watches are not mass-produced. They\u2019re limited edition, numbered, and made for people who want something special, something that says \u201cI\u2019m different, and I\u2019m proud of it.\u201d",
      "WHY THESE WATCHES?",
      "Because life\u2019s too short to waste on boring watches and even shorter to waste on confusing ones.",
      "Our watches rewrite the rules with two mesmerizing complications that are as rare as a blue moon (or a Monday morning without coffee):",
      "The design of the HX15 and HX16 models draws its soul from classic industrial manometers, those precise, rugged instruments once found in factories, ships, and scientific labs. Their robust geometry and utilitarian charm sparked the concept for these timepieces, transforming a piece of mechanical history into something wearable and eye-catching.",
      "TECH SPECS (FOR THE TECH-SAVVY AND CURIOUS)",
      "WANT TO CUSTOMIZE YOUR TIME MACHINE?",
      "Add some flair with these optional bands:",
      "Because your wrist deserves options that match your mood, outfit, or secret identity.",
      "WHAT\u2019S THE PROOF?",
      "Our previous Time Travel models HX11 (released July 2024) and HX12 (January 2025), generated huge excitement from the moment they launched\n\nThese models weren\u2019t limited prototypes or test runs. They\u2019re full-production timepieces, created with the same engineering, precision, and innovation that define our brand. That means if you're curious about the craftsmanship or technical performance of our upcoming models, you don\u2019t need to wait, you can experience it now with the HX11 or HX12.\n\nWe\u2019re not a brand making promises, we\u2019re a team that delivers results, again and again. HX11 and HX12 prove that we have already mastered the complex mechanics and production processes needed to bring these designs to life. That\u2019s why we\u2019re confident in every new model we create.",
      "Whether you're a collector looking for a standout timepiece or a potential backer considering our next innovation, remember this: you don\u2019t have to imagine what we can do, we\u2019ve already done it. And you can wear the proof on your wrist today.",
      "TIMELINE",
      "RISKS AND CHALLENGES",
      "We\u2019re not new to this. As professional watchmakers with years of experience and two successful Time Travel models under our belt, we\u2019ve minimized every possible risk. The only potential challenge? A slight production delay, and even that, no more than two weeks max. That\u2019s it. No drama, no question marks, just precision planning and expert execution.",
      "WHY BACK US NOW?",
      "Kickstarter isn\u2019t just where we launch projects, it\u2019s where our community lives and breathes. By backing now, you:",
      "TIME\u2019S TICKING... LITERALLY",
      "Wearing the Time Travel HX15 or HX16 is like wearing a secret weapon against boring time. It\u2019s for the dreamers, the rule-breakers, the sci-fi fans, and anyone who believes that watches should be fun, fascinating, and a little bit funky.",
      "This isn\u2019t just a watch \u2014 it\u2019s a statement.",
      "So, don\u2019t just watch time pass \u2014 make time your story.",
      "Back the Time Travel HX15 or HX16 now, before these 500-piece limited editions vanish into the time stream forever.",

    "company_name": "Steffen Haeuser",
    "allParagraphs": [
      "A 3D library for PiStorm (Pi4 or Cm4) equipped Amiga's, supported by Amiga games etc.",
      "Up to now 3D Games on PiStorm equipped Amiga Computers were limited to pure software rendering despite a Pi4/CM4 having a good 3D Chip (Videocore VI).",
      "The goal of this project is to change this. The developer Dennis Boon offered to create, for a certain payment, a Warp3D.library for PiStorm systems equipped with Pi4 and Pi CM4.",
      "Many games (for example Heretic 2, Quake 2 and Quake 1) already include a Renderer using MiniGL. MiniGL supports 3D Hardware Acceleration.",
      "So all that was missing was a 3D library to support the Videocore VI Chip.",
      "3D Hardware Acceleration will give you a higher resolution, faster fps and more stunning looking visuals for 3D Gaming on PiStorm-equipped Amiga systems.",
      "Additionally it will offer making ports of games possible which would require 3D Hardware acceleration (or would be too slow in pure software rendering on a PIStorm equipped Amiga).",
      "The funding will be exclusively used to pay the developer, Dennis Boon. If the project overfunds the extra funds will also go to the developer.",
      "What will be the result of this project is:",
      "- A 3D library for PiStorm 4 (and CM4). This will be not an \"official Warp3D Driver\", but a reimplementation of the API (or a new API) similar to the proof-of-concept done by Paraj (Paraj is one of the advisors of the project, the full source-code of his proof-of-concept is available to Dennis though note Dennis' Driver will be to a different 3D Chip - the proof of concept was for Pi3, now we go for Pi4).",
      "- The 3D library will be released under MIT Licence into OpenSource. A public GitHub Page will be set up for this.",
      "- If the current situation (certain people trying to prevent this project from happening) cannot be resolved a new API will be created, a MiniGL version which uses the new API, and several games will be adapted to support this new MiniGL version. We still hope the situation can be resolved in a way which is easier to handle though. Among the games who would be adapted in such a case are Heretic 2 and Quake 2 and all future Amiga 3D games by me. Other authors promised support as well.",
      "- Anyone who pledged at least 50 EUR will get Beta Versions (as soon as the project is far enough to be called Beta Version) in Binary form, anyone else will get the final version in Binary form. At finalization of the project the full source code will be publicly available",
      "A 3D library for PiStorm will make a big difference to 3D Gaming on PiStorm-equipped Amiga's. It will show the real power of these systems.",
      "It is a lot of work. With Dennis Boon we have a developer though who is very experienced with Amiga Lowlevel Hardware development.",
      "Something like this (asides from a proof-of-concept) has not yet been done for PiStorm. But it will be done now. Dennis also will have the possibility to get hints and tips about PiStorm from Paraj (the author of the proof-of-concept of the Pi3 Warp3D.library) and from Claude Schwarz and Michal Schulz.",
      "Another Challenge to the project is that the Documentation on the Videocore VI Chip is limited. We have though investigated already a lot, and found a lot of reverse engineered information as well as the source-code of several libraries (on Linux) doing 3D Display on the Videocore VI on Pi4. We also got contacts to people in the Linux community who wrote Rendering software for the Videocore VI and who offered to give advice.",
      "Because of this we are pretty confident that Dennis will be able with the available information to implement the 3D library for PiStorm 4.",
      "In case this project does not work out all people doing pledges will of course fully get a back-payment of their pledge.  But we think the case of the project failing for technical reasons is very unlikely.",
      "If you have any technical information or source-code related to the Videocore VI -> contact me at tirionareonwe@gmail.com.",
      "Bis jetzt waren 3D-Spiele auf Amiga-Computern mit PiStorm auf reine Software-Rendering-L\u00f6sungen beschr\u00e4nkt, obwohl ein Pi4/CM4 \u00fcber einen leistungsstarken 3D-Chip (Videocore VI) verf\u00fcgt.",
      "Das Ziel dieses Projekts ist es, dies zu \u00e4ndern. Der Entwickler Dennis Boon hat angeboten, gegen eine entsprechende Bezahlung eine 3D library f\u00fcr PiStorm-Systeme mit Pi4 und Pi CM4 zu erstellen.",
      "Viele Spiele (z. B. Heretic 2, Quake 2 und Quake 1) verf\u00fcgen bereits \u00fcber einen Renderer, der MiniGL nutzt. MiniGL unterst\u00fctzt 3D Hardware.",
      "Was bisher gefehlt hat, war eine 3D library, die den Videocore VI-Chip unterst\u00fctzt.",
      "Mit 3D-Hardware-Beschleunigung erhalten Sie h\u00f6here Aufl\u00f6sungen, schnellere FPS und beeindruckendere visuelle Darstellungen f\u00fcr 3D-Gaming auf PiStorm-ausgestatteten Amiga-Systemen.",
      "Zus\u00e4tzlich erm\u00f6glicht es Portierungen von Spielen, die 3D-Hardware-Beschleunigung erfordern, oder Spielen, die in reinem Software-Rendering auf einem PiStorm-Amiga zu langsam w\u00e4ren.",
      "Die Finanzierung wird exklusiv verwendet, um den Entwickler Dennis Boon zu bezahlen. Falls mehr Funding reinkommt als angegeben, wird auch das zus\u00e4tzliche Geld an den Entwickler ausbezahlt werden.",
      "Das Ergebnis dieses Projekts wird sein:",
      "Eine 3D library f\u00fcr PiStorm 4 (und CM4). Dies wird kein \u201eoffizieller Warp3D-Treiber\u201c sein, sondern eine Reimplementierung der API (oder eine neue API), \u00e4hnlich dem Proof-of-Concept von Paraj. (Paraj ist einer der Berater des Projekts. Der vollst\u00e4ndige Quellcode seines Proof-of-Concepts ist Dennis verf\u00fcgbar. Beachten Sie jedoch, dass Dennis' 3D library f\u00fcr einen anderen 3D-Chip erstellt wird \u2013 der Proof-of-Concept war f\u00fcr den Pi3, jetzt zielen wir auf den Pi4 ab.)",
      "Sollte die Situation einen Wechsel auf eine komplett neue API erforderlich machen (es gibt Personen, die versuchen das Projekt zu verhindern) dann wird eine angepasste MiniGL Library erstellt werden (als Teil des Projekts), die die neue API verwendet. In diesem Fall w\u00fcrde ich auch meine 3D Spiele (Heretic2 und Quake 2) mit der neuen MiniGL-Version neu linken, so dass diese unterst\u00fctzt werden. Andere Autoren w\u00e4ren auch - selbst in diesem Fall - an einer Unterst\u00fctzung interessiert und haben mich bereits kontaktiert.",
      "Die 3D library wird unter der MIT-Lizenz als Open Source ver\u00f6ffentlicht. Eine \u00f6ffentliche GitHub-Seite wird daf\u00fcr eingerichtet.",
      "Jeder, der mindestens 50 EUR beisteuert, erh\u00e4lt Beta-Versionen (sobald das Projekt so weit fortgeschritten ist, dass es eine Beta-Version genannt werden kann) in bin\u00e4rer Form. Alle anderen erhalten die finale Version in bin\u00e4rer Form. Nach Abschluss des Projekts wird der vollst\u00e4ndige Quellcode \u00f6ffentlich verf\u00fcgbar gemacht.",
      "Eine 3D library f\u00fcr PiStorm wird einen gro\u00dfen Unterschied f\u00fcr 3D-Gaming auf PiStorm-ausgestatteten Amigas machen. Es wird die wirkliche Leistung dieser Systeme zeigen.",
      "Es ist eine Menge Arbeit. Mit Dennis Boon haben wir jedoch einen Entwickler, der sehr erfahren in der Low-Level-Hardware-Entwicklung f\u00fcr Amiga ist.",
      "Etwas Vergleichbares (abgesehen von einem Proof-of-Concept) wurde f\u00fcr PiStorm bisher noch nicht umgesetzt. Jetzt wird es aber realisiert. Dennis hat au\u00dferdem die M\u00f6glichkeit, Hinweise und Tipps \u00fcber PiStorm von Paraj (dem Autor des Proof-of-Concepts des Pi3-Treibers) und Claude Schwarz und Michal Schulz zu erhalten. Au\u00dferdem haben wir Kontakte in der Linux-Community zu Entwicklern, die sich bereits mit der Thematik besch\u00e4ftigt haben, und angeboten haben, Tips und Rat zu geben, sollten wir diese ben\u00f6tigen.",
      "Eine weitere Herausforderung des Projekts ist die begrenzte Dokumentation des Videocore VI-Chips. Wir haben jedoch bereits viele Informationen recherchiert, darunter Reverse-Engineering-Ergebnisse und den Quellcode mehrerer Bibliotheken (unter Linux), die 3D-Displays auf dem Videocore VI des Pi4 erm\u00f6glichen.",
      "Daher sind wir zuversichtlich, dass Dennis mit den verf\u00fcgbaren Informationen in der Lage sein wird, den Treiber zu implementieren.",
      "Falls dieses Projekt wider Erwarten nicht umgesetzt werden kann, werden alle Unterst\u00fctzer selbstverst\u00e4ndlich ihr Geld vollst\u00e4ndig zur\u00fcckerstattet bekommen. Wir halten es jedoch f\u00fcr sehr unwahrscheinlich, dass das Projekt aus technischen Gr\u00fcnden scheitert.",

      "Everybody wants to improve their car\u2019s fuel efficiency. Improving your car\u2019s fuel efficiency is the realistic way to reduce greenhouse gases.",
      "What? Can we save money and protect the earth?\nYes!",
      "Are you and your friends drive cars?\nYes!",
      "Than there is the answer below.",
      "Earth's temperature has increased by an average of 0.14'F (0.08'C) every decade since 1880. But as we can see it is still hard to find practical ways to reduce greenhouse gases, which are the main cause of global warming.",
      "There are only two ways to reduce car emissions:\nreduce the number of internal combustion engine vehicles or improve fuel efficiency.",
      "Our team finally has developed a product that can protect the Earth. \nWe can stop global warming.",
      "In the following videos, we show the real reactions to the O2 BAND.",
      "Our aim is to attach O2 BAND to 1.5 billion internal combustion cars all around the world.  Encourage people globally and participate in environmental protection together. Our team believe that your support will not only achieve our goal but also be the start of the earth protection.",
      "O2 BAND PRO increased the 5~10% ratio of its main components such as germanium, elvan, and zeolite compared to the previous O2 BAND. The usage time increased twice and the main functions improved by over 13%.",
      "We believe this is a new challenge for us and the simplest way that all people around the world can contribute to protecting the earth. We are prepared to ship to any country in need of the O2 BAND's value. We hope that Indiegogo backers can empower our journey.",
      "The main technology of O2 BAND PRO is to enhance the density of oxygen entering to engine.",
      "O2 BAND PRO is made up of a mixture of components that emit infrared radiation in response to the engine\u2019s thermal energy.",
      "The heat energy generated by the engine causes changes in the car. It reacts with O2 BAND and creates a infrared radiation The infrared radiation vibrates the oxygen's movements and increases the efficiency of the engine's energy levels.",
      "Oxygen with high density is used during the engine's explosion stroke. Helps to increase combustion efficiency, reduces harmful emissions such as CO2/CO/NOX and Creates eco-friendly effects. (increase fuel efficiency, reduce carbon dioxide, etc.).",
      "The high concentration of the air increases fuel efficiency and decreases the emission. This results in an improvement in cost per mile. Reduced oxygen particle force leads to diminished noise and vibrations, noticeable by drivers. Even with the same force on the accelerator, the ride becomes significantly smoother.",
      "Click to see more detail",
      "O2 BAND: Creates high oxygen density and Co2 reduction.",
      "According to our in-house research lab\u2019s criteria, we could obtain meaningful results. We are also actively conducting tests with certified institutions. Once the results are available, we will disclose them to prove that our product is reliable.",
      "By supporting one O2 BAND PRO on Indiegogo, you'll also be contributing to distribution the O2 BAND to developing countries.",
      "Rather than scrapping old vehicles in developed nations, they are exported to developing countries, leading to even higher exhaust gas emissions due to the lack of proper emission regulations.",
      "In the hope of having more people join environmental protection, we've been freely distributing O2 BAND since 2020. We offered two O2 BANDs per applicant. Furthermore, we also provided them for free to owners of vehicles older than five years. Many people have joined our environmental protection efforts, and our goal is to extend this to 1.5 billion drivers around the world.",
      "If this trend continues until 2030, it will bring an amazing consequence \u2013 a 10% reduction in the world's emissions. We don't have to create something enormous to protect the earth. You've already joined the journey by attaching the O2 BAND to your car. We hope not only our Indiegogo backers, but also all people worldwide will participate.",
      "You can experience maximum efficiency for lasting 4 years.",
      "While researching the analysis of natural materials in our lab, we found specific materials and a set environment could alter the concentration of air. Especially, it confirmed the meaningful value change in a car\u2019s engine combustion system during the air intake process.",
      "We assure you that this technology will be the only solution to decrease car exhaust gases, which constitute 20% of greenhouse gases, the main factor in global warming. This is why we have developed the O2 BAND.",
      "The development of electric cars, hydrogen cars, strengthening car restrictions, and numerous methods aimed at mitigating the negative effects of cars on the world are insufficient, given the rapid acceleration of the climate crisis reality.",
      "Based on free distribution, we aimed to attach the O2 BAND to as many cars as possible. To make this happen, we've chosen Indiegogo, where all impactful people in the world gather. Please support our plan and efforts to address the climate crisis.",
      "1Plus1 Challenge has been engaging in eco-friendly business practices, striving to ensure harmony between business operations and the well-being of the Earth and its inhabitants.\nAfter establishing the 'Eco Fresh' brand in 2005, we have introduced a deodorant, a zeolite-based humidifier, and constructed our own factories to bring eco-friendly products to the market, thereby sustaining our commitment to a business-for-earth approach.\nIn 2011, we built a company-side lab and kept various R&D, acquired 20 patents. We participated in various abroad expos in technology field.",
      "We developed O2 BAND PRO with the aim of sustaining interest in environmental protection for the Earth and making it accessible for anyone to participate. Starting with O2 BAND PRO, we will continue to develop increasingly innovative and practical products for the environment",
      "If the reward is not delivered to the backer and is lost, we\u2019ll ship the new product or refund it.",
      "If there are any changes in the project, we will let everyone know via the updates section. In regards to import fees, these would be handled by our backers. Please be aware of this before backing.",
      "As the most trusted product launch company in the world, Enventys Partners has helped launch over 2,000 innovations with global sales of over $1 Billion dollars for our clients.",

      "In the journey of all Kickstarter projects, risks and challenges are inevitable and they are obstacles that must be overcome to realize your dream product. However, please believe in the strength and determination of our professional team, which will surely turn risks into opportunities. Currently, the product prototype is progressing well and the initial performance indicators have met expectations. From the precise fit of the cutter head to the stable output of the motor, it has been tested and optimized repeatedly. However, we are well aware that going from prototype to mass production is like going from a laboratory to a complex battlefield with many uncertainties. For example, the supply of raw materials may be interrupted due to market fluctuations, or the production process may have hidden problems during mass production. For this reason, we have established a comprehensive risk warning and response mechanism. On the one hand, we have established close cooperative relationships with a number of raw material suppliers to ensure stable supply. On the other hand, we have assigned technical experts to monitor the entire production process and formulated contingency plans in advance. In addition, we are committed to maintaining transparency. We will keep you informed of the progress of the project, problems and solutions encountered, and future plans through regular updates and exclusive information pushes.",

    "company_name": "Thomas Gostelow",
    "allParagraphs": [
      "The incredibly bright rubber block of light that attaches to anything and lights up everything.",
      "The Glowstone is a rubber flashlight that can be customised for almost anything, whether its for DIY, Photography, or even SCUBA diving.",
      "Housed in a strong silicone body, it is waterproof, dust-proof and gas-proof. With its stiff metal spine and composite construction, it's as tough as it is bright.",
      "There are 2 options available, the 900 Lumen Flashlight, which has a runtime of 1.5 to 60 hours, or the 2000 Lumen Flare which can operate for between 4 to 320 hours between charges.",
      "Yes, a pocket-sized light that stays continuously lit for 2 weeks!",
      "The flashlight has 5 brightness modes, edge lighting and 4 flashing modes including SOS and strobe. It also has charge indication.",
      "The Glowstone Flare takes everything good about the Flashlight and added even more brightness, power and functionality.",
      "It is aimed at those with professional lighting needs, or those that take their recreation seriously. It's perfect for those week-long hikes, working on a construction site or as a photographers portable lighting tool.",
      "The 2000 Lumens Flare is roughly twice the width of the Glowstone Flashlight and twice the depth, but with more than 5 times the battery power.",
      "It has colour temperature adjustment, UV lighting, red/ green lighting modes and even an app for controlling your flare remotely.  It also acts a wireless power bank. Combine this with the attachments that allow you to customise it and It truly is the Swiss-army knife of lights.",
      "The Glowstone Flare has an incredibly powerful 10.5Ah (3.7V) lithium-ion built into it, which is why it's so bright for so long. It's a serious piece of kit.",
      "Both the Flare and the Flashlight are available in Arctic white or Graphite grey.",
      "The Glowstone is a completely sealed rubber pebble of light with a stiff metal spine. It's wireless recharge only, has no sockets and therefore no weak points on its body, making it inherently tough.",
      "It means you can put it in some pretty extreme conditions, like a boiling pan or a block of ice, and it keeps working. You can even throw it off a 4 story building and it still work. That's the benefit of having an IP69K waterproofed and ATEX rated product.",
      "The patented design of the Glowstone makes it reliable and as it's flat and lightweight, its ideal for almost any job.",
      "Emergency services such as mountain rescue and the RNLI (lifeboat rescue) are looking at using the Glowstone as part of their standard issue gear.",
      "They like that it's fully waterproof, wearable, small and lightweight, has a long battery life and floods the area with a clean bright light.",
      "When people's lives are at stake, it's important to have your hands free and to clearly see what you are doing.",
      "But underneath that tough exterior, is a high quality, photography standard light.",
      "The light output is clean and even, making it great for selfies, zoom calls or for applying make-up with. Its also a very comfortable light to work under.",
      "Just look at the clean blanket of light the Flashlight emits compared to a traditional flashlight.",
      "As well as being a convenient everyday carry Flashlight, it's a great light for photography and filming, because of:-",
      "1) High CRI. With a colour rendition of 95+, the Glowstone shows the natural colours of the subject accurately.",
      "2) Natural Colour Temperature. The Flashlight emits a 5600K white light, equivalent to daylight at noontime. The Flare allows colour adjustment from between 2600K to 7000K.",
      "3) LED panel. The Glowstone is a rubberised, miniature version of the LED panels seen on movie sets.",
      "The Flashlight has 30 LEDs, whilst the Flare has 44 LEDs, all of which are individually controlled.",
      "As we use an LED array, the light from the LEDs merge to create a constant and clean blanket of white light.",
      "There are no lenses over the LEDs either, as these create halos and hotspots to the light output.",
      "Another benefit of the LED panel over normal flashlights is that the heat isn't concentrated in one spot. As the light is spread over many LEDS, the heat is spread over a larger area, so less heatsinking is required, making the Glowstone both smaller and lighter.",
      "We were lucky enough to have the Flashlight reviewed on a BBC TV program where members of the public review products.",
      "It was during the development stage of the Flashlight and we sent them our first 6 functional prototypes. How did we get on?",
      "Yes, that's right, we got the highest score ever awarded (at the time of filming)- 44.5/50!  We were very proud. I can be excused for shedding a tear... I hope!",
      "There are many ways to use your Glowstone, so we've created some fantastic accessories to extend its use in many different situations.",
      "These are provided in the packs and are also available individually as add-ons.",
      "The tripod handle can be used in multiple ways. Simply attach the light to its handle to use as a traditional Flashlight. Then, with the slide of a collar, transform it into a tripod, clamp or stand.",
      "Pivoting head lets you change the light angle so you can light those hard to reach places.",
      "Simply transform the handle into a clamp, a stand or even a hook that can be hung off pipes and branches.",
      "Measures: 145mm x 35mm (5.7\u2033 x 1.4\u2033)",
      "You can also use it as a handle for your GoPro or other action camera by attaching it to the same mount. Or mount it to the side with a t-piece as it makes an excellent action camera light.",
      "This tripod handle uses the light bracket to attach to your Glowstone.",
      "This fits around the outside of your Glowstone Flashlight or Flare and allows you to use the huge range of Glowstone or Go-Pro accessories.",
      "If you have selected on of our pack add-ons (SCUBA, bike, Photo or Go pack), we will supply the size you need depending on whether you've selected a Flare or a Flashlight.",
      "If you are selecting your add-ons individually (rather than buy a pack bundle), please make sure you have also selected a light bracket.",
      "Each light bracket comes supplied with a thumb screw when selected as an add-on.",
      "NOTE: You need the light bracket to attach your Flashlight or Flare to the following add-ons.",

      "As the name suggests, you can also clip it to your belt or clothes. This clip gives you hands-free lighting.",
      "This is the attachment that really converts the Glowstone into a multi-tool light. gives you many quick ways to use your light.",

      "If you choose the Flare pack, you will be supplied with the magnetic MOLLE clip stand instead of the nano-suction and the belt clip. NOTE: This pack does NOT come with a wireless charger.",
      "These packs come supplied with  a QI slim-line wireless charger that can also be used to charge your other wirelessly powered devices such as later smart phones, (or those wonderful smart mugs that people love so much.)",
      "Be the envy of all bike riders with this pack. Caters for a range of bikes and helmets.",
      "This add-on pack includes a Glowstone Flashlight for your rear bike light.",

      "An adjustable helmet strap and rail is designed to fit to vented bike helmets.",
      "2 x bike mounts so you can mount the Flashlight to your bike frame.",
      "The Glowstone make an excellent action camera light if you want to shed light on any road incidents that may happen (heaven forbid) to you at night.",
      "The Glowstone makes a great SCUBA or snorkelling light, at a cheaper price than you would normally pay for a SCUBA light.",
      "The Glowstone Flashlight being used for SCUBA diving.",
      "You can use it for lighting you way beneath the waves, taking those underwater snaps, or using the flashing modes to notify nearby divers to that you need their attention. I hope in the future it becomes a part of every SCUBA divers kit or water-sports enthusiast.",
      "Whether you want to be look good on your next Vlog, look stunning on your next Instagram post or have a convenient light that you fit into those small gaps to light those scenes better on a film set, this pack will provide you with the accessories needed.",
      "And for those that want to be ready for anything, anytime, we've made The Professional pack.",
      "This is the real Swiss army knife pack. As well as a huge range of quality accessories, you get a beautiful carry case to keep it all tidily in one place.",
      "We've patented the design and construction of the Glowstone. But how can it be innovative in a market where thousands of flashlights already exist?",
      "1) Seal everything in Silicone.",
      "Silicone is a wonderful material. It's soft and lightweight but tough. It's resistant to saltwater and environmental degradation and it's fire-resistant, with a melting point of 1410 degrees Celsius.",
      "Silicone's made from sand rather than oil, so it's manufacture is more environmentally friendly than plastic.",
      "By covering everything in silicone, both inside and out, we create a solid rubber pebble of light, with no weak points.",
      "Combine that with its metal spine and the Glowstone just bounces it's way to safety.",
      "Even when you put it in the most uncomfortable of situations, like freeze it in ice, THEN throw it off a building. Have a look at this video!",
      "Covering everything in silicone makes the Glowstone inherently robust and waterproof, but it also acts as an oxygen barrier. When things are isolated from oxygen, they can be preserved for a very long time, just like DNA in a mosquito trapped in amber.",
      "Silicone is used in heat pastes to remove heat from electronics. As the components are potted in silicone, the Glowstone is very affective at removing the excess heat.",
      "Our patented construction means the Glowstone passes the highest standards for waterproofing (IP69K - completely dustproof and can withstand washdown at pressures of 80 to 100 bar/1,160 to 1,450 PSI, in phases of 14 to 16 l/min, and at temperatures up to 176\u00b0F/80\u00b0C.)",
      "Its designed to meet the highest standards for use in hazardous areas. The electronics are potted in silicone,  the silicone will isolates any sparks from the electronics, which prevents an explosion. As the inside is filled in, there is no internal gas that could quickly expand and cause an explosion. This is how we meet the highest ATEX rating (Zone 0), without any extra features such as gas vents which would have increased the size and cost.",
      "Atex rated: safe for use in Zone 0 (where Ignitable concentrations of flammable gases or vapours are present for long periods of time)",
      "ATEX flashlights typically cost many hundreds of dollars, but through good design, we've provided the highest standards for safety and functionality at a consumer price.",
      "On top of all that, silicone makes the Glowstone so satisfying to hold and squeeze.",
      "2) Make it wireless recharge only.",
      "Nearly every electronic device I've owned have failed because of the power socket. My last phone died because water got inside, through the power port. The phone before became unusable because I couldn't get the power cable to connect. Even my laptop's power port was recently repaired too. All that expensive equipment made redundant by the failure of one simple component.",
      "The socket is also a weakpoint in the body of electrical devices. If I was to drop my device, it would tend to break around the power port.",
      "Not only that, but the socket itself takes up a lot of space on a device. It's time to say goodbye to the power port and replace it with a very thin, lightweight wireless power coil.",
      "This means that the Glowstones are surprisingly small and thin. The Flashlight is just over 1/2\" thick (Dims: 68x51x14mm) , whereas the Flare is 1.2\" thick (86 x 69 x 30mm).",
      "The wireless coil can also transmit power as well as receive it. So the Flare can be used as a wireless power bank, should you need it.",
      "3) Change the shape",
      "Making it flat and rectangular makes it convenient to carry. It doesn't roll away when you place it somewhere and Its rubber exterior grips well when perched on surfaces.",
      "Its flat back meant that we could use cool new things like nano-suction pads to stick it to flat surfaces.",
      "It shape also made it easy to customise, which brings us to the final point.",
      "4) Make it modular",
      "We have hand lamps, head torches, bed-lamps, inspection lanterns etc, all for specific lighting needs. What happens? Because they are single-use, they are seldom used. So you end up with a drawer full of lights that when you try and use them, the batteries are dead, or worse, leaking.",
      "Why can't your head torch be a hand lamp, a bike light or even an desk lamp?",
      "One of the most exciting things about the Glowstone is that it can be adapted to almost any scenario. Whether it's stuck to the side of a sewing machine to help an elderly lady with failing eyesight continue her hobby or a disabled user that simply couldn't find a light to fit their wheelchair, the Glowstone unlocks many new applications and, in some cases, can improve someone's quality of life as a result.",
      "Work began on the Glowstone back in early 2016. We purchased a bunch of SMD LEDs, soldered resistors to them and some standard batteries and, after a week of assembly (mainly with tape, solder and sealant) were dazzled by the prototype. Have a look yourself.",
      "We then spent 2 years trying to squeeze that assembly you see in the video into something smaller than a credit card.",
      "There was nothing else like it in the world so we excitedly launched the Glowstone on Indiegogo in late 2018.",
      "The original concept was to mould the body around the electronics and batteries. For 2 years we worked on moulding the Flashlight. Sadly though, the moulding process was too hot for the batteries, even if we froze them beforehand. These 2 years of manufacturing development cost many thousands of pounds and nearly killed the product and our company.",
      "So we went back to the drawing board and changed the design. Instead of moulding around the components, we moulded just the outside and filled the inside with a silicone. This was a much more reliable process and less damaging to the batteries. At last we had a process that we could produce the Flashlight with.",
      "Finally, we could fulfil our Indiegogo project and send our backers a better product than we had promised them during the campaign. They appreciated our tenacity and we appreciated their kindness and patience.",
      "The journey to create the Glowstone has been long and challenging but rewarding for all involved.",
      "We return to Indiegogo 5 years later with the perfected Glowstone Flashlight. We are so proud of it - it is truly a product that wouldn't exist without crowdfunding.",
      "For this campaign, we have created 2 major additions to the accessories that make the Glowstone the multi-tool light we dreamed it would be. The belt clip was upgraded into the Magnetic MOLLE stand and a light diffuser was created.",
      "This campaign is in part to create these new accessories, but it is mainly to give birth to the Glowstone flashlights bigger brother, the Glowstone Flare.",
      "The Flashlights are being built now and will be ready to ship as the campaign closes.",
      "The new accessories for the Flashlight and Flare will be made once the campaign closes. Flashlight packs that contain the new accessories will be shipped in February.",
      "The Flare requires more electronics and software development and will be shipped in April 2024.",
      "The Flare's manufacture is similar to the Flashlight, with the addition of a protective steel enclosure around the electronics and batteries. Which brings us nicely to our next section....",
      "The Flare has a very powerful battery (3.7V, 10500 mAh), is a little larger than an action camera and weighs around 11 Oz (275 grams).",
      "It also has:",
      "Stainless steel internal lining",
      "We've added even more strength to the Flare by encasing the electronics AND batteries in a 1mm thick stainless steel enclosure. This shell will be filled with and encased in silicone to give it even more strength. It may even make the Flare bomb-proof. We are looking forward to testing that out :)",
      "UV LEDS",
      "This enables you to a number of cool things like authenticate bank notes or spot scorpions when you are out in nature.",
      "Red and Green LEDs",
      "A lot of ramblers, early morning dog-walkers and military personal requested a red/ green light option as this light doesn't travel far. So we've added both colour options to the Flare.",
      "Temperature colour adjustment",
      "This is the photographers new best friend, so we needed to give it the ability to finetune to their needs. 22 of the LEDS are at 2600K and 22 of them are at 7000k and you can adjust between the two, either using the two buttons on the Flare, or via the app.",
      "App controlled",
      "Because of it's enormous battery life and its extra features, we are developing an app to better control your Flare. This will give you a few extra features as well allowing you to leave your Flare mounted in a wall for example but turn it on and off, check its battery level or change its colour temperature.",
      "And of course, because it has the same patented construction as the Flashlight, It is waterproofed to the highest standards (IP69K) and Intrinsically safe to use in hazardous areas (Atex rated - zone 0)",
      "Combine that with it's 6 times more battery life and you are left with THE ULTIMATE LIGHT.",
      "The Flashlight was designed to be the new age of personal lighting, the Flare has been made for your professional lighting needs - Where you need a really bright clean light all night and day.",
      "Thank you for reading this far, I hope you back this project and help bring the improved FLASHLIGHT and the brand new FLARE to life.",
      "We are the archetypal crowdfunding company. We rely heavily on the support of our wonderful backers and are very engaged with them, We use their feedback to improve the product. It's a very satisfying process for all involved.",

      "Thanks to your incredible support, we\u2019ve reached our community stretch goal of raising $500,000 on IndieGoGo! This means that every BraX3 pre-ordered until 29th of May 2025 will include a 256GB microSD card\u2014for free. This is our way of saying thank you for believing in us and being part of this amazing journey.",
      "Smartphones are more than just communication tools\u2014they're also spying devices. They collect tons of data, like your location, browsing history, and even access to your contacts and microphone. This information gets collected, categorized, and resold, helping organizations build detailed digital profiles about you.",
      "The trend with newer smartphone models indicates that user privacy protection is unlikely to improve. The integration of advanced Artificial Intelligence will enable these devices to process personal data faster and more efficiently, resulting in a more accurate data-rich digital profile of each user.",
      "The BraX3 lets you enjoy all your favorite Android apps without sacrificing privacy. Stay productive, keep up with the news, stream media, chat with friends, and share files\u2014all while keeping your data private and secure.",
      "All orders during our IndieGoGo campaign will include a BraX3 device with iod\u00e9OS premium features for life. iod\u00e9OS premium features include advanced adblocking, network blocking, adult content blocking, unethical social media blocking, and parental control.",

      "As an open platform, BraX3\u2019s AOSP (Android Open Source Project) code will be shared with developers of other custom ROM projects. This means that developers who wish to port their custom ROM to BraX3 will have access to the resources they need to make it happen. We believe that every custom ROM project contributes to the collective mission of enhancing privacy in mobile technology, and we\u2019re excited to collaborate with the open-source community to support these efforts.",
      "The BraX3 is modularly designed so that you the consumer can replace parts by yourself with standard tools. To help you keep your BraX3 for years, we\u2019re committing to provide spare parts for at least six years after launch. Alongside this, we\u2019ll share detailed repair guides, diagrams, and technical documentation so you can easily repair your device yourself or with a trusted provider. With BraX3, you\u2019re investing in a phone built for longevity and true ownership.",
      "The open-source movement champions collaboration, innovation, and freedom from proprietary restrictions. In that spirit, the BraX3\u2019s \u201csee-through\u201d design symbolizes a shift toward tech that is honest, instead of hidden and obscure.\n\nIt\u2019s a reminder that technology can be both powerful and transparent, empowering people to understand and trust the products they rely on to store their personal data.\n\nThe design of BraX3, with its transparent backplate, is a tribute to the open-source movement\u2014a commitment to transparency, accessibility, and trust.",
      "Experience the BraX3 like you've never experienced a smartphone before. We take transparency seriously in every aspect of our project. So we decided to open and share our BraX3's 3D model. In full detail, including every little bit under the hood.",
      "The BraX3 production test run is officially in progress! As part of this crucial phase, we\u2019re manufacturing 150 BraX3 devices to thoroughly evaluate the assembly process and fine-tune every detail before full-scale production begins. \nTo ensure the highest quality and durability of the BraX3, we\u2019re also conducting a series of aging tests. These tests simulate long-term use, helping us guarantee that your device meets the standards you expect and deserve.",
      "Enjoy some behind-the-scenes visuals from the manufacturing plant:",

The last remaining milestone is getting a production-ready version of iod\u00e9OS.  Enjoy some of the images from our last visit.",
      "With BraX3, we\u2019ve taken everything we learned from BraX2 and pushed it to the next level. Our motivation remains the same: to create a smartphone that empowers users with complete control over their data. In a landscape where new devices increasingly prioritize profit over privacy, BraX3 was designed to be the opposite\u2014a truly privacy-friendly smartphone that\u2019s honest, easy to use, and affordable for most. \n\nBraX3 is more than just a phone; it\u2019s a statement. It represents our commitment to digital freedom and the belief that privacy should be accessible to everyone, not just those who can afford high-end alternatives. We\u2019re excited to share BraX3 with the world and to offer a solution that puts users back in control of their own digital lives.",
      "The BraX3 will be delivered globally through our logistics hubs located in the US, Canada, and the European Union. See our FAQ section to find out if you will be charged any additional fees.",
      "We can\u2019t thank you enough for checking out our project and helping us make BraX3 a reality. If you like what you do and want more people to hear about it you can help us by spreading the word on X, Reddit, Mastodon, LinkedIn, or somewhere else!",
      "As with any technology project, there is always a risk of delays or unforeseen challenges. However, the risks associated with the BraX3 project are minimal. This isn\u2019t our first launch\u2014we successfully introduced BraX2 over two years ago, and our experience has prepared us well. Additionally, our manufacturing partner, Lunr, brings over 15 years of expertise in developing and manufacturing mobile products, ensuring a high level of reliability.",
      "We\u2019ve already done all pre-production tests and we have validated a pre-production sample of BraX3, which greatly reduces the likelihood of delays. However, some factors beyond our control\u2014such as supply chain issues or force majeure events\u2014could still impact delivery timelines.",

      "1. Adapting to Your Phone:\n\u2022 The pucks attach to the steel plate on the MCON, which is what your phone mounts to.\n\u2022 If your phone has a larger camera bump, like a caseless iPhone 16 (camera bump ~4.5mm), you\u2019ll stack two pucks to ensure proper clearance.\n\u2022 For phones with smaller camera bumps, like an iPhone 12 (~2mm), one puck is usually enough.\n\u2022 If you\u2019re using a case, the case itself often acts as a spacer, so you might only need one puck or none at all.",
      "2. For Phones & Cases Without MagSafe:\nWe\u2019ve included a MagSafe adapter in the box. This is a 2mm-thick disc with adhesive on one side. If your phone or case doesn\u2019t have MagSafe (e.g., most Android phones), simply stick the adapter onto your phone or case. The adapter enables your phone to work seamlessly with the MCON system. By stacking the pucks as needed, you can customize the MCON to fit your phone perfectly, no matter the camera bump or case situation.",

      "MCON is designed to adapt to any smartphone. The only outliers are vertical flip phones (like Z-Flip or Razr), but based on feedback, we are working on designing different plates as an option that justifies the MagSafe puck further to the side. We will provide more updates on that as we develop it.",

      "Measuring just 5.67 inches long, 2.67 inches wide, and under three-quarters of an inch thick, the MCON is compact enough to fit into any pocket, purse, or backpack. It charges via USB-C in 30 minutes and delivers weeks of gaming on a single charge.",

      "Packed with versatile tools, Geekey 2.0 is your go-to companion for whatever adventure comes your way - whether you're hiking, biking, camping, riding, boating, fishing, or skiing - the possibilities are endless! Below, you\u2019ll find the essential functions we've perfected over the years to help you out when you need it most.",
      "Equipped with one of the most important functions of any portable tool...the BOTTLE OPENER. Cleanly integrated on the end portion providing the ability to rotate upwards with leverage - which is the best method for any bottle cap opening. Note: The lighter must slide out when using the bottle opener.",
      "Integrated towards the end portion is a sharp ENCLOSED CUTTER blade that is positioned to slice through anything pulled through the slot. The recessed blade is angled to wedge and cut through material when pulled through. Since the blade is enclosed, it is TSA compliant (without the lighter) making it an easy companion to fly with and take anywhere.",
      "A CLOSED BOLT WRENCH is integrated on both sides of Geekey 2.0 which will adapt to both imperial and metric hex bolt sizes. The front fits imperial hex bolt sizes 7/16\", 3/8\", 5/16\", 1/4\", 3/16\", and 1/8\" and the back fits metric hex bolt sizes M8 (13mm also 1/2\"), M6 (10mm), M5 (8mm), M4 (7mm), M3.5 (6mm), M2.5 (5mm), M2 (4mm), and M1.6 (3mm). With the closed hex bolt wrenches positioned in the center, it provides adequate leverage when tightening or loosening hex head bolts.",
      "Geekey 2.0 has an EMERGENCY WHISTLE integrated on the bottom side making it perfect for many different situations. The blown air passes through a small channel on the bottom and exits the bottle opener hole making a high frequency pitch when the air is cut. The top finger tone hole provides two pitch ranges when the hole is open or covered. The lighter must be removed, but can move in and out to create a \"kazoo\" effect if desired. Note: Interesting fact we discovered...it is a US federal law for all water vessels (including paddleboards and kayaks) to carry a sound-producing device like a whistle while on the water...this is primarily for safety purposes to signal distress or intentions to other boaters.",
      "Insert any 1/4\" or 4mm hex bit into the BIT DRIVER hex hole at the base of Geekey 2.0 to turn it into a full functioning screw driver. The recessed staggered hex holes allow full engagement of both universal hex sizes for ultimate versatility.",
      "The foundation of the Geekey 2.0 design all started with the form factor of the J5 mini Bic\u00ae lighter. Geekey 2.0 is a tightly integrated LIGHTER DOCK sheath that provides a multi-tool dock to integrate with your lighter...making one compact solution. The lower inside has two small ribs that the lighter slides against when pushing the last part of the lighter inside. The ribs provide an \"interference fit\" making it just snug enough to stay in place, but loose enough to pull the lighter back out when needed. This creative solution truly provides the ability to have tool + fuel seamlessly fused together for any survival or casual use situation.",
      "Insert up to size 16 (AWG) gauge wire into the WIRE STRIPPER hole at the base of the multi-tool to the desired stripping point. Pull the wire out and the steep internal angled edge will cut and strip the wire sheathing.",
      "Along the length of Geekey 2.0 is a FILE that can be applied to most any material when needing to smooth it over. The file has additional side bevels along its edge to provide a maximum width of filing surface.",
      "Geekey 2.0 is equipped with a 3.2/3.3mm BIKE SPOKE KEY which is one of the most common sized spoke nuts. The end slot slides over the spoke and then onto the square spoke nut for engagement. Note: The recessed cutting blade is positioned far enough back for proper engagement of the spoke nut.",
      "The MULTI-FIT SCREW DRIVER tip is one feature we absolutely had to carry over from the first generation. The screw driver tip is unique and completely versatile in that it will turn many types of the most common screws in the world. The tip will fit #2/3 slotted, #2 square, #2/3 phillips, #2/3 slotted/phillips combo, and #2/3 square/phillips combo screws. This tip is handy when in a pinch to tighten or loosen most any common screw! Note: The tip is integrated at a 25 degree angle on the corner to maximize the clearance needed to reach a recessed screw. The tip is also positioned in a way that when Geekey 2.0 is placed on its base, the tip point will perfectly touch the surface for balance.",
      "The LANYARD HOLE is designed in at the base of Geekey 2.0 and adapts to many different sizes of standard keyring loops and lanyard tethers. Note: A helpful tip we've found when carrying on a keyring is to put a very small keyring loop between Geekey 2.0 and the main larger keyring...this provides additional flexibility if ever needed.",
      "One of the most common needs we've also found over the years is having the ability to quickly and conveniently open packages. The integrated SCORING TIP (also carried over from the first generation) is placed on the corner edge at a 25 degree angle to provide maximum clearance while cutting through packaging tape.",
      "The LID OPENER is an open notch integrated on the end of Geekey 2.0 that is designed to fit over the rounded corner of any medium, or large sized metal paint can lid. When the notch is placed over the rounded edge, simply rotate outward and the elliptical geometry will pry the lid open. Note: Just like any metal paint lid opener, you will need to move around the edge in multiple spots for full lid removal.",
      "Geekey 2.0 has MEASUREMENT features that include both an imperial (inch) ruler on the front, a metric (centimeter) ruler and a 90 degree protractor on the back. These measurement features are designed for \"quick checks\" when needing to verify, create or determine any sort of length or angle.",
      "Geekey 2.0 has the ability with the versatile screw driver tip design to accommodate a MULTI-HEAD FIT on most any type of screw head style. The tip will fit pan head, high-profile fillister head, flat head, binding head, oval head, hex head, round head, low-profile button head, and large diameter truss head.",
      "Geekey 2.0 has an open notch WIRE BENDER at the open end which can create tight angled bends in wire when needed. This feature most often might be utilized in a situation when needing to create a unique aid to help address a need.",
      "At the base of Geekey 2.0 is a small protruded tip that is a STAPLE PRY for removing staples from paper. Simply place the slotted opening over a staple and slide forward across the paper to remove the staple.",
      "Geekey 2.0 is designed to work WITH OR WITHOUT the J5 mini Bic\u00ae lighter. When the lighter is absent there is still full functionality in every single tool feature with no compromise in the strength or versatility...Geekey 2.0 is compact and can easily go wherever you take it.",
      "The J5 mini Bic\u00ae lighter comes in a variety of solid colors which will all fit in Geekey 2.0. From older generation colors to new, you can add any solid color you like!",
      "Designate multiple Geekey 2.0's for different places to keep with your lighters...boat bin has blue, camping box has green, tackle box has yellow, glove box has orange, ski bin has red...",
      "The possibilities are endless as to where Geekey 2.0 can go. It is small enough to be conveniently stored just about anywhere and makes a great gift for anyone in need of a quick, convenient tool. Note: the J5 mini Bic\u00ae lighter is not included with any perk, but can be bought just about anywhere in the world in any color.",
      "Geekey 2.0 was designed to be as small as possible to provide the ability to go anywhere. Geekey 2.0 easily fits in the palm of your hand and is non-obtrusive on a keychain. The size accommodates all the necessary tools and functions while remaining very small.",
      "The initial start was trying to design a multi-tool that could cover a lighter while keeping the design language of it's predecessor. The balance of facets, angles, proportions and curves were adopted while designing the functional features.",
      "The initial 3D printing began with a high resolution plastic photopolymer resin made by a process called Stereolithography (SLA).",
      "Once the design detail was refined, the prototypes were printed in stainless steel 316L with a process called Binder Jetting. The final process (the model seen in the videos) was 3D printed in 420 stainless steel with a process called DMLS (Direct Metal Laser Sintering), which provides both high tolerance accuracy and strength. With the metal models we tested out all functional features to verify they worked properly. One of the most critical measurements on Geekey 2.0 is the internal touch points where the J5 mini Bic\u00ae lighter is held in place. An INTERFERENCE FIT was created with two small internal ribs on the bottom inside of Geekey 2.0. The ribs provide two concentrated press points that allow the lighter to be held in place, but also removed.",
      "The metal 3D printed prototype shown above is our final verification DMLS model to test all fit, function and star in our videos. Note: The final production of Geekey 2.0 will have a smooth, crisp and bright flawless Stainless Steel finish. All 3D printed metal can not produce the finish resolution like MIM (Metal Injection Molding) will produce.",
      "Geekey 2.0 is designed to be as small as possible without sacrificing function. The overall dimensions are 61mm (2.4in) x 24mm (0.94in) x 16mm (0.63in) and weighing 1.5oz in solid Stainless Steel.",
      "We're ready to take Geekey 2.0 to the next level - transforming it from a concept prototype into a fully realized production product that expands the Geekey Multi-tool brand. Your pledge isn\u2019t just a contribution; it\u2019s a statement that Geekey 2.0 belongs in the market. With your support, we can bring this innovative tool to life and make everyday tasks easier and safer for people everywhere.",
      "With your pledge you will not only be receiving the first production run of Geekey 2.0, but will be contributing to all the costs involved including the production of the Metal Injection Molding (MIM) tooling, package die tooling, shipping, and the first production minimum batch order of both Geekey 2.0 and its packaging.",
      "With that said, let\u2019s build something great together!",
      "The below timeline represents the major milestones achieved and major milestones remaining to bring Geekey 2.0 to market. There are a lot of smaller steps in-between to cross the finish line, but the next high level milestone will be successfully raising funds for all production tooling and the first batch order.",
      "Carve Design is a product development studio driven by curiosity and a passion for turning bold ideas into reality. Founded by award-winning industrial designer Brad Sliger, the studio builds on over two decades of experience shaping the medical, fitness, sporting and cosmetic industries in the greater Seattle area.

A graduate of Western Washington University, he balances his love for design with a commitment to family, adventure, and creating products that are as beautiful as they are purposeful.",
      "This is our second crowdfunding project on IndieGOGO and with the tremendous success of our first Geekey Multi-tool reaching over 903% of our goal, we knew crowdfunding was the way to go. We believe using IndieGOGO for crowdfunding Geekey 2.0 is one of the best ways to raise funds because it not only provides access to a large, engaged community of backers, but also offers invaluable marketing exposure. By launching on IndieGOGO, we can gauge public interest and validate our product idea before committing to large-scale production. IndieGOGO fosters a sense of community, allowing us to interact with backers, receive feedback, and build a loyal customer base early on. Additionally, IndieGOGO's all-or-nothing funding model option ensures that we only receive the funds if we meet our goal, which helps mitigate the risk for both us and our backers. This approach makes it easier to raise the necessary capital while also generating buzz and excitement around our new product idea.",
      "There are many unforeseen risks in product development and while we have thoroughly vetted every possible issue, there are always unknown risks when creating something that has never been done before.",
      "The most challenging aspect of this project will be consistently hitting the extremely tight tolerance to hold the lighter in place when docked. We're using what is called an \"interference fit\" where it is snug enough to hold in the lighter, but not too snug so it can't be easily pulled out. Luckily the tolerance on the J5 Mini Bic\u00ae lighter is very consistent in size, but Geekey 2.0 will not have a lot of flex, so hitting the tolerance on the internal touch points will be key...no pun intended.",
      "Geekey 2.0 will be metal injection molded allowing these tight required tolerances to be very closely controlled. With metal injection molding we can consistently produce the exact same part over and over while hitting the tightly required docking constraints. We are working closely with the supplier to assure they understand this critical measurement must be consistently met to make this product feature successful.",
      "We completely understand if you can't contribute at this time, but that doesn't mean you can't help. Please feel free to spread the word by sharing! The more noise we can make, the better the chance we have to succeed! Please use the IndieGOGO share tools or any other way you see best to share!",

      "The original B-2 Nano Blade Tactical Pocket Knife first debuted in 2017.  It raised nearly $500K in total funding with over 6,000 backers and went on to become the World's Most Successful Pocket knife selling over 30k units worldwide in its first year.  We're back on Kickstarter with a complete redesign of the B-2 Nano Blade, this time concealed inside a discreet military style sheath.  After 5 successful campaigns and early delivery each time, Bomber & Company is extremely proud to introduce the newest addition to our collection, the B-2 Dog Tag, a fully concealed nano blade pocket knife.",

      "Straight Edge Blade: The sharp flat ground straight edge is perfect for thin sharp precision slices and versatility of everyday use. The blade is also perforated to allow cutting and slicing of materials to not stick onto the blade itself. It provides a cleaner sharper cut.",
      "Sizing: Discrete conceal-ability is the definition of the B-2 Dog Tag. The full opened length is only 3.7inches and when closed, it stands at 2.75inches in length and less than 0.2 inches in thickness. The miniature size of the pocket knife means it can easily be hidden in any coin pocket, wallet, or worn around the neck as a standard dog tag.",
      "Weight: The ultralight weight of the B-2 Nano Blade comes in at less than 2oz making it the world's lightest, fully functional, 440Carbon black stainless steel tactical pocket knife.",
      "Materials: 440C black stainless steel allows B-2 pocket knives to be one of the strongest nano blades ever created by mankind. Rated at 58-60HRC the B-2 Dog Tag is extremely tough and will stay sharp for longer periods of use. 440C is a highly durable and corrosion resistant stainless steel. The B-2 Dog Tag can endure years of outdoor wear without extra maintenance to protect the blade from rusting.",
      "Butterfly Lock: The B-2 Dog Tag uses a custom designed double-sided butterfly lock. Safety was one of the main concerns when it comes to a nano blade/knife of this size. We wanted the design the be suitable for beginners as well as intermediate knife experts. The lock is released by squeezing both sides of the B-2 Dog Tag and engaged automatically when let go. This makes the knife design much more robust than traditional smaller blades which are just folding with no locks. The user can feel and hear the tactile sound and click on the lock.",
      "Durability Tested: While designing the B-2 Dog Tag, we made sure to leave ZERO wiggle room. Once locked into place, the blade is completely tight and will not move. It was incredibly difficult engineering this, as the B-2 Dog Tag is very small in size. We made sure to trial and error fractions of a millimeter to finally get the B-2 Dog Tag to hit perfection.",

      "Zigbee: inov.li/linuszigbee\nZ-Wave: inov.li/linuszwave",
      "Introducing the newest innovation from Inovelli: a radar equipped smart switch that detects human presence. Gone are the days where you're sitting in a room and the motion sensor turns the lights off, making you wave your hands around to turn them back on. With millimeter wave (mmWave) technology, the sensor emits radar which can detect whether you're present or not. In fact, it's the same technology that car sensors use to dynamically detect their surroundings.",
      "So, who is Inovelli for those that don't know? Simply put, we're a smart home company who has spent the last 7 years specializing in smart lighting. We've sold over 145k units, generating $7.5 million in revenue across the United States and Canada and we're here to bring our latest idea to life, the mmWave smart switch.",
      "If you already know what a smart switch is and just want to get into the details, feel free to skip this part.",
      "You may be asking yourself, \"what is a smart switch?\". Great question.",
      "Smart switches are normal looking light switches that have a wireless radio built into them that communicates with a hub or gateway to turn your lights on/off or dim. They can be used as normal switches and blend in with your aesthetics. The main benefit here is that someone who isn't familiar with your smart home can use the switch like normal and never know it's part of your home automation.",
      "If you don't know what a hub/gateway is, don't worry, we'll help! More on that at the end of this section.",
      "Here's an example of how a smart switch is used remotely (using the Aeotec SmartThings Hub):",
      "Don't have a hub?",
      "We've got you covered. Our recommendation for the easiest setup is going to be using Aeotec's SmartThings Hub, which has a very simple, but powerful app. Simply select the, \"Beginner Bundle\" Perk and we'll ship you the hub right away so you can get started before this switch even launches.",
      "Below we'll show you what this will look like within the Samsung SmartThings app to give you an idea of how the main features shown above come to life and give a further explanation into each element of the switch. Of course, this product will also be supported on Home Assistant (ZHA & Zigbee2MQTT) and Hubitat.",
      "Human Presence Detection",
      "The entire reason we created this switch was because we were tired of the traditional Passive Infrared (PIR) sensor switches. How many times have you found yourself sitting at a computer and your lights turn off because no motion was detected? Or better yet, have the lights ever shut off on you mid-Reddit browsing on the toilet in your bathroom and you have to waive your hands to try to get the light to turn on?",
      "Finally, from a security side, have you ever wanted the peace of mind knowing your children are in their rooms sleeping?",
      "Where a typical Passive Infrared (PIR) motion sensor detects a heat signature moving across its field of view, Millimeter Wave (mmWave) uses 24 GHz radar and onboard processing to monitor the presence of people in a space. While a PIR sensor can\u2019t detect a person once they stop moving, a mmWave sensor recognizes that a person has entered the space and will continue to identify that they are there until it identifies them leaving the area. More on mmWave technology at the end of the listing.",
      "Animated RGB LED Bar Notifications",
      "The LED Bar on the right side of the switch can be used as a, \"heads-up display\" to alert you of various triggers. For example, you can have the switch LED Bar pulse purple every morning at 9:30 to remind you to take your medicine. Another popular example is to have the LED Bar turn red when your alarm system is armed and green when it is unarmed. Finally, be notified of severe weather by having your LED Bar turn orange and chase as shown below.",
      "With individually addressable LED's, a full color spectrum, and over 15 different animations, the sky is truly the limit in what you can notify yourself of.",
      "Multi-Tap Scene Control",
      "Imagine controlling your entire house at the touch of a button. With multi-tap scene control, you can setup various, \"scenes\" that will activate based on how you tap the switch. For example, let's say you want to run a, \"bedtime\" scene when you go to bed where if you double-tap down on your light switch, all of your lights turn off, your doors lock, your garage doors close and the temperature is set to 68.",
      "With 24 different button combinations, you can setup virtually any scene you'd like. From turning on movie lights, to locking the doors, rest assured, this switch allows full control at your fingertips.",
      "Smart Bulb Mode",
      "Control all your smart bulbs directly from your switch by using, \"Smart Bulb Mode\". SBM locks in full power to the smart bulb and uses digital commands to turn on/off/dim (or change colors) of the smart bulb. No more covering up the switch with tape to keep your smart bulbs powered!",
      "This switch is a powerhouse of features. With over 60 parameters, you can customize it to your personal preferences. Below are the current features and specs - if these change, we will let you know.",
      "NOTE: The final switch may include lux monitoring which would add a tiny sensor at the bottom of the switch near the air-gap. We kept it out right now because we wanted to test it first before implementing it. This will not add to the final cost on this listing.",
      "FEATURES",
      "SPECS",
      "NOTE: These specs are based off our Blue Series 2-1 Switch, which we plan to model this switch off of. They are subject to change and we will let you know if they do.",
      "For indoor use. Specifications subject to change without notice due to continuing product improvement.",
      "This project has an amazing US based team (shown above) as well as an experienced R&D team that spans across Canada and SE Asia. Together, we've built and sold over 145k units equating to over $7.5 million USD, but we're still the small, responsive company we were from the start, equally as passionate about smart homes and the technology that goes into them. We love working alongside our thriving community of smart home owners to put the best products in our own homes and we can't wait to start working on this product. Thank you for your support and we look forward to chatting with you online or seeing you at trade-shows.",
      "Eric H. - Founder\nEric M. - Founder\nCourtney W. - Operations",
      "Each project we embark on has a special codename, and this one is no different. The inspiration for this project came from a Tweet by Linus, the creator of Linus Tech Tips. In the Tweet, he expressed frustration with the performance of a competitor's switch (there's much more to the story, but you can investigate that on your own).",
      "As longtime admirers of Linus and his work, we were disappointed to see him lose some enthusiasm about the capabilities of an automated home. So we've made it our mission to create the ultimate switch to work with Home Assistant (among others) to ensure it integrates seamlessly into Linus's setup. We're thrilled to partner with all of our supporters and we're confident this amazing switch will bring Linus renewed faith in the smart home industry. We can't wait for the day when he raves about our latest innovation.",
      "Below are some screenshots from how the switch should show up on various hub/gateways. They are taken from how our current Blue Series 2-1 Switch shows up, so these should be pretty accurate.",
      "Samsung / Aeotec SmartThings",
      "Here's how the switch should show up in SmartThings (and how our Blue Series 2-1 switch currently does):",
      "The left side shows the main device control menu where you can remotely turn on/off or dim the switch, whereas the right side shows the various settings that are configurable on the switch.",
      "Hubitat",
      "As with SmartThings, all capabilities will be exposed on the Hubitat platform. This includes all of their hubs (C4-C8). Here's how the switch would show up in Hubitat:",
      "Home Assistant",
      "This will also work with both ZHA and Zigbee2MQTT.",
      "If you're unfamiliar about millimeter wave, don't feel bad, it's relatively new to the smart home space. However, it's been used in a lot of really cool products, some of which we use daily.",
      "Probably the most common use-case is within cars. These are the sensors that can detect dynamic driving conditions (distance from moving vehicles, how many vehicles are around you, etc).",
      "Image Source: https://www.ti.com/sensors/mmwave-radar/automotive/overview.html",
      "PIR (Passive Infrared) vs mmWave Radar Sensors",
      "PIR Sensors are the current solution to motion detection and have been used since the 1970's and can commonly found in wall switches, sensors, and light fixtures. PIR works by monitoring the change in the infrared light radiating from an object in its field of view.",
      "This means that if the object is stationary (ie: typing at your desk, sleeping and, yes, sitting on the toilet), the sensor will not pick up a radiation change and therefore think you're not present.",
      "mmWave works by using radar (the Doppler principle) to determine the objects motion, speed and even direction. In the case of this switch, the sensor will transmit a 24 GHz waveform which will reflect off an object that is in the sensor's field of view. This reflected waveform is received by the radar transceiver and will have a frequency difference referred to the Doppler frequency (think Doppler radar used for weather) and will give the exact position of the object in the field of view.",
      "This is important because radar will constantly detect the object, even if it's still, which is the limitation of PIR (which again, tries to detect the change of temperature which won't happen if you're still).",
      "Said in simple terms, PIR detects only motion, while mmWave detects motion and presence.",
      "Examples in the Smart Home",
      "Bringing this technology to the smart home space is exciting and has a ton of amazing implications.",
      "Smart Home Solver created a video talking about a standalone sensor that he tested that goes over real life examples that can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVjrgQSWlLI",
      "Here are some of the use-cases for your smart home:",

      "You asked, let's make this happen!",
      "Due to the overwhelming success of the Zigbee version (fully funded in just over 24hrs), we will be creating a Z-Wave 800 Series equivalent if we can get the funds up to $325,000. This will allow us to cover the remaining R&D, certifications, etc.",
      "IF WE AREN'T ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE Z-WAVE SWITCH, WE WILL REFUND YOU.",
      "At this time, we plan on most of the features that are promised above to be available on the Z-Wave version. If anything changes, we will make an announcement.",

    "company_name": "Connor Burdett",
    "allParagraphs": [
      "Help us stop deaths, deforestation, poverty & emissions - all by replacing firewood.",
      "Our Technology is called the Spark, and it turns organic waste into clean energy and fertiliser.\nThe perfect solution to replace Firewood while empowering communities.",
      "Firewood is causing a massive problem for people in low/middle-income countries, as well as for the environment at large. This campaign will go towards funding a mould, which will make our technology a fraction of the cost per unit, which means more accessible to millions more people.\n\nTo Support Our Mission of ENDING this Crisis, Purchase a 'Perk'.\nALL the Money Raised through this Campaign goes Directly into the Moulds for the Spark.",
      "Across the globe, 2.3 billion people - over a quarter of humanity - rely on firewood for daily cooking, according to UN estimates. In rural Mozambique, where we have been prototyping (seen in the image above), most families earn less than $200 equivalent per year, a stark reality backed by World Bank poverty data. All they can afford is firewood; There are no alternatives at this income level. Let me explain why this is a problem.\nWhy cooking on firewood is the single biggest social and environmental crisis in today\u2019s world.",
      "The health effects are the most devastating.\nThe World Health Organization reports that firewood smoke kills 3.1 million people every year from several diseases such as COPD; Ischemic Heart Disease; Lung Cancer; Strokes; Pneumonia. 230,000 of these deaths are children under the age of five, who die from childhood pneumonia. To put that into perspective, it is equivalent to a double story, A380 Airbus with over 600 young children on board, crashing.\nEvery.\nSingle.\nDay.\nLeaving no survivors.\n\nUntil we can reliably produce the Spark, these children will keep dying, and families will keep suffering. With your support we can change this.",
      "Another extremely underrated impact of this crisis, is the time and energy which it steals, from women and children in particular. The World Food Programme notes that just the act of simply collecting firewood and preparing fires, consumes multiple hours daily for rural families. Time that could be spent on education, generating income, or literally anything else more productive. This is probably one of the most successful forms of oppression which still exists today!\nChildren miss school to help their mothers collect wood, killing future opportunities.\nFamilies spend less time on productive work, killing the hope of escape. \nI believe that everyone deserves equal opportunity in this world, that is why the Spark needs to exist. Let's give families back their time.",
      "All this and we haven't even mentioned, the environmental impacts.\nEmissions are a global burden. UN Environment Programme data shows firewood cooking contributes to over 2% of global climate-damaging emissions. This seemingly harmless act releases more black carbon, than the entire aviation industry. This accelerates climate change, hitting the poorest hardest.\nOn top of that, the obvious one. Deforestation. The World Resources Institute estimates 10 million hectares of forest are lost every year to firewood. About 14,000 soccer/football fields, vanishing every day. This erodes ecosystems and livelihoods in regions like Mozambique, and is only getting worse with increasing populations.",
      "For the past 8 months, we have been prototyping in central Mozambique (Catandica), fine-tuning our technology with a singular focus in mind.\nMaking the most accessible clean energy technology in the world, so that everyone - regardless of their geographic, educational, or financial situation - can live free from firewood.",
      "The fundamental technology is known as 'Anaerobic Digestion'.\nIt is the process of using methanogenic bacteria, to break down organic waste, in the absence of oxygen, to release Bio-Methane which we can capture and use for cooking. \nThis bio-methane is what makes the biogas combustible and a useful fuel.\n(Fun fact: methane is what is being used to power modern day, orbital rockets!)\nThe organic waste after being broken down is called 'Digestate'/'Fertiliser', and is similar to organic compost - with the added benefits of mirco-bacteria, which is essential for healthy soils.",
      "Albert Einstein once said \"Make everything as simple as possible, but not any more\".\nWe have taken this to heart when designing the Spark, to create the most affordable, robust, and easy-to-use clean energy technology.",
      "With your help, the Spark will completely replace the need for firewood, for good.",
      "Since September 2024, we have been prototyping with 10 units in central Mozambique .\nThis program has lead to a number of valuable insights, both on the physical design of the Spark, in terms of: gas storage size; necessary tank volume; inlet-outlet height ratios etc. \nBut also many learnings in terms of human behavior: Feeding frequencies; struggles; miss understandings; un-forseen needs etc. \nAll of which we have taken into account when designing the Spark.",
      "We are looking for \u20ac4000 to finance the moulds for the Spark. \nWith this we will be able to dramatically lower the cost of producing each unit (from over \u20ac300/unit to under \u20ac200). which will make it much more accessible for rural Mozambican Families.",
      "If you were fortunate enough to be born in a world, where the way you cook is not threatening yours or your children's life. Where the way you cook does not hold you in a state of poverty and kill any hope of escaping. Then I beg you, please, share our story with a friend or your network.\nIf you are in a stable enough financial position, then I also ask you to contribute to the development of the Spark. Let's end to this crisis for good. \nYou Have the Power to Ignite the Change.",

      "You can toggle between controller mode or keyboard mode to your preference depending on the platform and game that you're playing.

      "The Hex Evo has an analog stick (with push button 5), four top buttons (1-4), two bumper buttons (6-7), and one side button (Shift Key Button).\n\nWhen pressed, the 'Shift Key' button enables a secondary action for all of the other 7 buttons (buttons 1-7), allowing for 14 different inputs.\n\nAdditionally, pressing buttons 1+2, 3+4, and 6+7 at the same time gives three new inputs.

      "Quanta Vici's first launch was back in October 2020.",
      "It was a challenging time for us and everyone in the world. As you may recall, it was around the same time that US-China relations were not at their best, the pandemic was out of control with new deadly strains, and the supply chain experienced disruptions globally. We certainly felt that stress through the delayed shipments of raw materials and high import fees.",
      "Nevertheless, we battled against all of that for our first launch. We had no prior investors, significant budget, or experience producing \"Smart Heated Apparel\" since it was the first of it's kind and still is to this day. Whatever obstacle was thrown our way or fell upon our heads, we simply extracted the kinetic friction as energy and powered through with determination.",
      "We knew that Quanta Vici is not just about Heated Gloves and Socks. Quanta Vici goes beyond Heated Apparel. We are a Smart Apparel company working on expanding the spectrum of human senses and abilities through practical smart products that can be used in the day-to-day life.",
      "Quanta Vici's slogan is \"Make Life Yours\" and not \"Let It Go\" We have produced and successfully delivered thousands of Smart Heated Wearable products over the past two years. The new line of Smart Heated Vegan Gloves, Slim Jackets, and Vests is powered by the same Smart Technology that has proven its high performance in all weather conditions across a wide range of activities.",
      "Critical business activities, including logistics, distribution, and numerous customer care agent training, are integral aspects of Quanta Vici's strategy that we have fully in place and ready to go (unlike our first launch). The one and only new thing is the luxurious style of Vegan Leather Gloves, Slim Winter Jackets, and Vests, which we have developed with a focus on medical conditions during our R&D phase.",
      "All the pictures you see use the final material, PrimaLoft's sustainable fabric, performing as we expect - in a synergy of our unique and stylish designs with Smart Heated Wearable Technology. All that is waiting right now is for us to give the green light and papers to our manufacturer to produce the units and bring warmth to people, even in the world's coldest areas.",
      "The last challenge that we experienced last time was timely delivery, which is common in launching new products and something we had prepared for. Unexpected obstacles still delayed our shipments. However, we managed to deliver just in time for the Fall/Winter season, so it was not a failure!",
      "This time, even though we have all this preparation and have already been down this road, we are scheduling the delivery for the fall. Even though we estimate that the production will be completed during the summer. It is better to be early than late!",
      "Upcycling, replaceable batteries, software updates, using premium material from globally tested and trusted suppliers.",
      "Quanta Vici aims at providing a luxurious user experience with high consideration of the environment. We have designed our packaging to be perfect for repurposing, such as being used as a chic and tidy organizer in your closet. We are also working on introducing an upcycling program.",

    "allParagraphs": [
      "Unique automatic watches inspired by wildlife",
      "As the tallest mountain in Africa and the highest free-standing mountain in the world, Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania is a natural wonder to behold. Wildlife teems around the base of Kilimanjaro and among them are the Big Five game animals such as the leopard, rhino, elephant, African buffalo, and lion. A proud and powerful creature, the lion is the basis of the design concept for our first watch from the Chaka Collection.",
      "In 2018, our watch designer Ricky, who traveled on a ten-day plus adventure trip to Tanzania, Africa.  He took part in a local Safari tour, went to several national parks to see wildlife, and spent a few nights at several famous camp sites under the guidance of professional driver guides.  This trip allowed him to witness numerous wild animals with our own eyes, including of course, the lion. This stimulated our thinking and creativity, and together we wanted to create a watch brand inspired by wildlife.",
      "Okepo's logo is inspired by the flamingo, which can also be found in Tanzania. On our logo, the flamingo\u2019s shape is simplified and filled with bright orange, representing the vitality and vigor of African wildlife.",
      "During the trip, we had made initial sketches, and since some details had to be measured with the help of a caliper, we ended up with detailed hand-sketchings when we returned to our studio in Hong Kong.",
      "Chaka Collection contains six different colorways and combinations to meet individual tastes. The case and bracelet of K04 and K06 feature a special highlight; a destress polish was applied to show and emphasize the theme of a wildlife environment.",
      "//Raw steel case - Green sunray dial - Mint green bezel insert",
      "//Raw steel case - Light blue sunray dial - Greyish blue bezel insert",
      "//Raw steel case - Dark blue sunray dial - Dark blue bezel insert",
      "//Antique steel case - Ash brown sunray dial - Dark grey bezel insert",
      "//Light Gun case - Dark blue sunray dial - Dark blue bezel insert",
      "//Light Gun case - Dark blue sunray dial - Dark blue bezel insert",
      "Chaka's bezel is inspired by the front silhouette of a lion, presenting a rugged, wild, and fierce image. The unique bezel shape is equipped with external helical teeth that allows wearers to turn the bezel with ease. In addition, the insert ring is made of strong K1 glass, and then matched with SuperLuminova's luminous coating.",
      "Bezel Feature",
      "Technical Drawing",
      "The lion's tail was the inspiration for the watch hands. The hour hand is in the shape of a rounded diamond, with sharp chamfers made by CNC cutting process on both sides of the hour hand.",
      "The hand window is filled with Super-Luminova so you can still read the time clearly in the dark African wilderness.",
      "The Crown is deeply etched with Okepo's logo and filled with bright orange. This eye-catching highlight of crown is symbolic as the watch\u2019s signature.",
      "Technical Drawing of Crown",
      "The case back is cast in relief with a vivid lion. A lot of hard work was put into creating a delicate and detailed exterior in which initial hand sketching, painting, and multiple corrections to the 3D drawings took two weeks. After the process of casting the mold and modifying the mold twice, we finally achieved the result that we were satisfied with.",
      "Super Luminova is another important feature of the watch. The applied indexes on the insert ring, watch hands, and dial are all coated with Super Luminova. After absorbing UV light for a period of time, it can maintain long-term luminous performance, ensuring that users can still clearly read the time in dark environments, such as in the outdoors or while diving.",
      "The dial is a double-layered with a slight gradient of sunburst polishing, which is quite eye-catching and pleasing to the eye. The surface is inlaid with 12 super large, three-dimensional indexes. The applied indexes are made to a super high thickness of 0.8mm, and the hollow part in the middle is filled with Super Luminova's luminous powder.",
      "The ultra-thin Miyota 9039 automatic movementpowers the Chaka. The movement of this Cal. 9039 delivers the premium level of Miyota performance. It is equipped with a power reserve function of up to 42 hours; and a vibration frequency of 28800 per hour. These features make it a reliable and accurate watch. The rotational flow of Miyota's rotor is also the reason why we choose this movement. This time, we deliberately did not choose a movement with a calendar disc, so that the design of the watch is more concise and prominent.",
      "Chaka comes a small curved Sapphire crystal. A thickness of 3.7mm meets the water-resistant structure requirements of the diving case. Sapphire Crystal is scratch-resistant, and its bottom is treated with three anti-reflective coatings. The coating is blueish, which makes reading the time clearer and the appearance more sophisticated.",
      "The vintage-effect leather roll box is Chaka's packaging box. We deliberately chose gray-brown leather with a destree texture, drawing inspiration from the bark of the baobab tree found in Africa. The inner lining of the box is covered with a pleasing orange leather, echoing the Okepo logo color.",
      "TIMELINE\nIt took more than five months from the conception of the design concept to the completion of the campaign launch. During this time, the prototype was revised three times, and finally the design and appearance of the watch exceeded our requirements.",
      "Throughout the years, we have maintained good business partnerships with stable, reliable, and cooperative suppliers. This is one of the key reasons why we have been able to ensure  our promise of on-time delivery. The delivery would be in April 2023.",
      "Two Year Warranty//  Our watches come with a 2-year warranty. In case of a defect during this time period, your watch will be repaired free of charge.",
      "Shipping // We will ship to anywhere in the world, with the exception of the following: Azerbaijan, Barbados, Belarus, French Guiana, Honduras, Mongolia, Peru, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Solomon Islands.",
      "Please Note// You will need to provide a residential/office address. We will be unable to deliver to P.O. boxes.",
      "Delivery will be via EMS or Fedex and your tracking number will be sent via inbox message, 2-3 days after the item parcel is shipped. If you have any queries, please do not hesitate to contact us directly: info@ovd.com.hk",
      "During our nearly two-week national park safari tour, Chaduu took care of our driving, eating, and safari wildlife guide. A real man, he is a human dictionary who is really familiar with African wildlife and has excellent eyesight and a deep understanding of animals. What impressed us greatly was his professional ability to make safety assessments in the field. He also made us understand more about his peoples\u2019 high regard for nature and made us learn and really recognize more about Tanzania.",

      "The original blend of Delessa chocolate spread was created more than 15 years ago to meet an important need: chocolate treats for our restricted diets. The creator of Delessa chocolate spreads struggled with health issues. There was literally nothing on the market to satisfy the need for treats, especially chocolate, without ingredients such as flour, gluten, dairy, and some type of sugar or an undesirable sugar alternative which spikes glucose or causes side-effects. Even today it is still difficult to find healthier options for chocolate treats.",
      "Our intent is not only to fill in the gap where other treats leave off, but also to introduce our enlightened chocolate as a delicious alternative treat for anyone and everyone. By launching Delessa chocolate with your support we can Spread the Love.",

      "Additional blends of chocolate as well as other delightfully yummy spreads are in our plans for the future. We want to continue to develop new chocolate and other snack spreads that are better for you than what is out there (we are working on a chocolate blend without coconut and also a slightly sweet pumpkin seed spread that has an easier consistency to spread and to eat than what is currently available) Our goal is to give our customers delicious, fresh, and satisfying treats and snacks without the compromises or concessions we face with regular treats. By creating a community through crowdfunding, we can get your input on products we develop.",
      "We may face challenges in our early stages with regard to scaling production from a small to a large scale -- we are planning ahead so that we can mitigate these challenges as much as possible. We've managed for a year so far so we're confident we'll be here for you!",
      "We began fulfillment in early 2023. Currently we have product in stock and ship within 48 hours of receiving an order.  If we experience any delays, we will provide detailed updates immediately so that you are kept in the loop! We will begin fulfillment on a first come first served basis, so orders that come in later in the campaign may not receive items until January.

Shipping, included in this first stage of the project launch, will only be charged if the area to be shipped exceeds the stipulated average national shipping rate.",

He studied architecture in Munich and the United States and earned a master's degree from the Technical University of Munich. His architectural projects include the new museum for Los Angeles County Museum of Arts, Porsche and BMW Research Centers in Stuttgart and Munich, as well as various high-rises in Florida and New York and the new building for the United Arab Emirates Mission to the United Nations. In 2018, Norbert founded his own studio called nominomis. Today, nominomis, is based in Chicago and focuses on the intersection of product design and architecture. The studio\u2019s work spans from various architectural project to product designs such as the lamp series Mr.Watt. Norbert perceives design and architecture as one strongly intertwined field with the human scale and interaction at its core. His work is often linked to the concept of anthropomorphism, which establishes associations between human characteristics and manmade objects.",
      "DesignNest",
      "Since 2019, nominomis is collaborating with Dutch company DesignNest (www.designnest.com) for prototype improvement and eventually the final production of Mr.Watt. After extensive discussion and careful planning, we decided to change material from wood to plastic for various reasons: cost reduction for better affordability, longer lasting, more fun possibilities (customisation). We turned to crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter and Indiegogo once again \u2013 not only does it allow us to reach out to all of you who love innovative designs, but it also allows us to study market\u2019s reaction towards Mr.Watt and us to produce these little guys in bigger quantity. By pledging to pre-order your very own Mr.Watt before production, we can use your contributions to place the orders for all required components. These parts have a minimum order quantity required by manufacturers to get the right prices, so it\u2019s key that we reach the numbers needed.",

      "The next generation of the World\u2019s Most Spacious Pop-Up Dual Expandable Hardshell Rooftop Tent",
      "There are lots of exciting things to love about camping but setting up your tent is rarely one of them. Lugging it around while it\u2019s packed up can be quite a hassle and pitching it usually ends up being way more complicated than it should be.",
      "TEDPoP makes sleeping off the ground super easy and convenient. Just unfold it and you are ready to go! After you install TEDPoP once, you can use it to camp whenever and wherever you want!",
      "TEDPoP offers an enormous space allowing up to 5 people to lay down comfortably at once due to dual expandable panels on both sides of the tent.",
      "It offers a non-obstructed 360\u00b0all-around view that is generally not possible in the case of expandable rooftop tents due to their structure.",
      "Since there are 2 entrances, you can change the direction of the tent entry to any side that you prefer as well.",
      "Windows on all sides create an openness that exceeds regular closed-off tents.",
      "The \u201cStar View\u201d ceiling window opens up a beautiful view of the sky and stars.",
      "TEDPoP\u2019s tent skin material is applied with a high-density canvas fabric to maximize air permeability. Along with that, a fly material equipped with features complementing the canvas skin is used simultaneously to block UV and demonstrate perfect waterproof qualities.",
      "The super water-repellent premium canvas is a material newly coming to the fore in the tent industry and is a fabric used to draw oil paintings. Because it\u2019s an excellent moisture absorber, you won\u2019t have to worry about condensation forming inside the tent. As a material with self-waterproof features, it boasts durability that withstands even the strongest rains with ease.",
      "One of the annoyances commonly experienced in typical camping tents is \u201ccondensation.\u201d This refers to the phenomenon where the differences in indoor and outdoor temperatures cause the vapor in the air to turn into water drops within the tent. This process occurs frequently in general polyester material tents and gives a hard time to campers in hot or cold weather conditions.",
      "To solve this problem, TEDPoP has adopted a newly developed insulation method. By utilizing an insulated closed-cell structure with maximized insulation, we\u2019ve drastically minimized condensation, which was a fatal drawback of existing products. We have also developed the world\u2019s first thermally static composite panel (3 layers in the picture below) and are currently in process of getting a patent. The panel improves temperature-resistant stability while fundamentally blocking the persistent condensation of other rooftop tent products.",
      "Additionally, boosting air permeability by applying the high-density premium canvas fabric as the tent skin material has played a huge role in wiping out condensation as well.",
      "The exterior with a streamlined form that resembles a clamshell is crafted in an aerodynamic design. Such design structure minimizes wind resistance and is not only safe to use in strong winds, including typhoons, but also helps with fuel efficiency and noise while driving.",
      "TEDS has opted for ABS material instead of FRP used in average tents, embodying the pro-environment aspect, and at the same time, has grafted a condensation-preventing technology by applying insulating layers.",
      "Ref. FRP (Fiber Reinforced Plastic): Despite being plastic, this is a hybrid material made with a compound of various materials and is completely unrecyclable, which has become a major cause of environmental pollution and has led the recent related industries to drop its use.",
      "In addition to these features, the high-strength aluminum honeycomb panel doesn\u2019t alter its shape, even when faced with a weight load of 2000lbs. This is thanks to it utilizing the same material which is used to make aircraft wings, meaning that it\u2019s adapted for resulting in maximum durability.",
      "When you raise the cover to a certain height, the expanding force of the condensed gas strut bar increases, causing the hard shell to open automatically. Following the opened hard shell, the extension panels on both sides consecutively open by the movement of the link structure.",
      "Most hardshell rooftop tents on the market were optimized for a smaller group of people, from 1 to 4 people maximum. However,  TEDPoP allows up to 5 people to sleep comfortably inside. This is achieved through dual expandable panels that extend from both sides of the main panel. However, adopting such a structure would lengthen the cantilever as much as the extended panel\u2019s length, hindering the tent pitching, and the moment arm would also be lengthened, possibly becoming a shaky factor in durability aspects including stability and load capacity.",
      "The highlight of TEDPoP is that in order to overcome this obstacle, we have divided the extension panel to both ends of the main panel, and by reducing the moment arm, we facilitated high stability and even the convenience of a pop-up.",
      "TEDPoP is available in white and black colors. At the end of the campaign, we will send you a separate survey where you can select your colors.",
      "\"Dark Wine Red\" is the basic color of TEDPoP that you will receive.",
      "At the end of the campaign, we will send a separate survey from which you can choose other custom colors as shown in the picture above.",

      "Ultimately, we are confident that we can provide everyone who not only enjoys camping and Overlanding but has an interest in outdoor activities the best camping experience through our product.

      "My name is Ted Ko. I am a father of three children and the founder of TEDS. During my life, I have always enjoyed camping. In my late 30s, I came across some personally difficult times, and things were not working out. I took that time to spend more time with my family, and we decided to spend some time camping across New Zealand. We covered most parts of the country camping out in various types of rooftop tents. Spending time out in nature with loved ones truly helped me look back on myself and mentally secure myself to think and plan out my next steps. I wanted to share the experience and the feelings I had felt during camping with as many people as possible. After returning, I gained experience in the industry as a technical designer and soon started drafting my own original rooftop tent design.",

      "eto is a beautifully designed wine decanter that gives you the freedom to enjoy wine at your own pace, and never waste a drop again. Its innovative, patented preservation system uses an airtight seal to keep wine perfectly fresh for at least 7 days, as proven by blind taste tests carried out with 'Master of Wine' Richard Hemming, and independent laboratory testing at Bangor University.",
      "eto is easy to use - its unique design ensures every step is quick, clean and complements the traditional ritual of enjoying wine.",
      "Due to its patented preservation system that creates an airtight seal over the wine, eto halts the oxidation process, which in turn preserves the wine\u2019s freshness and taste.",
      "As we become more health-consciousness, more and more of us are choosing to enjoy just a glass or two rather than several \u2013 or even save our wine drinking for the weekend. eto gives us this freedom.",
      "With eto you can open and savour that treasured bottle over a longer period.",
      "The long funnel gently oxygenates the wine to release its flavours and the sharp lip ensures drip-free pouring.",
      "eto\u2019s ability to prevent wine oxidation has been proven by independent tests carried out at Bangor University. The graph shows just how effective eto is compared to other wine preservation products.",
      "Beacon Laboratories. \u00a9 Bangor University 2016",
      "eto underwent rigorous testing and re-testing over a 12 month period with a variety of red and white wines. The results were indisputable - eto far out-performed competitor products in every tightly-monitored test.",
      "While science proved eto prevented oxidation, blind taste tests with wine experts showed that eto protected the quality of the wine too.",
      "'Master of Wine' Richard Hemming \u2013 and writer at JancisRobinson.com \u2013 took part in two separate blind taste tests, comparing freshly opened wine with its eto 7 day preserved equivalent.  \u201cOn the seventh day ... for me, the results were unanimous: there was no perceptible difference between a freshly opened bottle and the eto-stored sample\u201d Read the full article HERE.",
      "After taking part in a similar blind taste test, Wine Director at Honest Grapes, Tom Harrow, commented \u201cA wine which had been decanted (into eto) seven days beforehand tasted every bit as fresh as a wine which had come from a recently opened bottle. But it also had the added benefits of decanting, in that the wine was breathing ... it was opening up ... it tasted absolutely delicious.\u201d",
      "I am Tom Cotton, an award-winning industrial designer with nearly 20 years experience of bringing products from concept to market. I am passionate about protecting the environment, and in 2011 became interested in designing a product that helped to reduce wine wastage.",
      "Wine wastage is a huge environmental problem across the world. In the UK alone, 50 million litres of wine are poured down the sink every year - see WRAP report EVA063. A recent study by Laithwaite\u2019s Wine put the figure down as enough to fill 333 Olympic-sized swimming pools, and also these disturbing statistics:",
      "Our inability to preserve wine once the cork has been popped is a major cause of this wine waste. And I quickly discovered that the wine preservation products on the market were either ineffective or hugely expensive.",
      "My inspiration for eto came after a friend highlighted the method - common amongst wine experts - of transferring leftover wine into a smaller container to minimise the air contact. After experimenting, I found the method of reducing air exposure very effective. I just needed to work on the container\u2026",
      "After months of exploration I filed a patent for an innovative design in September 2012. At the core of the invention was a new unique valve concept that sealed wine at exactly the right moment, no matter how much wine was left.",
      "The \u2018design for manufacture\u2019 stage brought significant challenges. Not only did the valve require costly \u2018proof of concept\u2019 prototyping, experts in the glass industry said the precision required for glass simply couldn\u2019t be achieved within the cost.",
      "After a highly rigorous and competitive process, I was awarded an Innovate UK government grant to develop eto further. This support proved invaluable, allowing me to build over 60 functioning prototypes, develop a detailed manufacture design and test eto\u2019s effectiveness in the laboratory.",
      "Five years on, we have a product that really works. eto looks beautiful, preserves wine brilliantly and is exceptionally easy to use, store and maintain.",
      "We have built a strong relationship with our chosen manufacturing partner, and use only the highest quality materials to ensure eto is effective, elegant and durable in the long term.",
      "All materials are food approved and fully compliant with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the German BfR, ensuring they have no effect on the wine\u2019s flavour. All materials are also BPA free.",
      "eto dissembles into four main parts and these can be individually replaced if damaged. (Although we do not foresee any reason to replace parts due to natural wear & tear.)",
      "As glass specification was one of our major challenges, we undertook extensive research before selecting a glass manufacturer who we were confident could achieve the consistent glass tolerance required for eto without spiralling costs. High standards in worker treatment and environmental impact were also essential.",
      "We have worked closely with our manufacturing and assembly partner for over two years. They have over 30 years of experience bringing premium houseware products to market, and their skilled quality control team inspect each product before shipping.",
      "eto has taken several years to perfect, as we have built multiple prototypes to improve and simplify its design. We now have a product with minimal parts, precision-engineered seam-free glass, and high grade, anti-corrosion stainless steel that is both durable and aesthetic.",

      "Because having an uninterrupted sleep at night shouldn't be that hard.\n\nYou've tested every type of bedding material out there. Even gone as far as to cover yourself with extra blankets to keep the cold away or decided to sleep without one so that you won't wake up feeling like a boiled egg.\n\nBut no matter what you do, you can't seem to get a good night's sleep.\n\nThis is HILU \u2014 your ultimate blanket for all seasons made from pure graphene fiber.\n\nIt's time to say goodbye to restless nights and sweaty mornings because HILU has got you covered, literally.",
      "Most traditional blankets trap heat, making hot sleepers like you even hotter (not in a good way, tho ;) ). And because they don't insulate well, cold sleepers can end up feeling chilly.",
      "HILU is the world's first graphene-made blanket that adjusts to your body temperature so you can sleep all night comfortably \u2013whatever the season.\n\nIt\u2019s the perfect addition to any bedding set. Lightweight and highly durable, with unmatched warming and cooling properties.",
      "If you've ever wished you could somehow harness the power of microchips to help you get a good night's sleep, your wish can be a reality.\n\nThe HILU blanket is made from pure graphene fiber with Adaptex Technology that reacts naturally to your body's temperature, keeping you comfortable all night.",
      "But how is this miracle fabric made? The process is called \"Wet Spinning\", and it's very similar to making Kevlar, the bullet-proof material. This process creates a stronger fabric than steel, yet it's still light, soft and comfortable on the skin.",
      "So whether you're a light sleeper who tosses and turns all night, or someone who gets hot flashes in the middle of the night, the HILU blanket is here to help you get a good night's rest. Sweet dreams!",
      "You asked: is graphene safe?\n\nGraphene oxide in its raw form (in powder) may not be safe. However, processed single-layer graphene, such as that in our graphene fibers, is totally safe and it is certified by the IGCC and the OEKO-TEX100.\n\nThis means Hilu blankets are safe for both babies and adults.",
      "There's nothing worse than feeling like you're being hugged by an oven (or a fridge \u2013we don't judge). With HILU, you'll never have to worry about that again.\n\nImagine a blanket that reacts to the touch of your skin; that\u2019s the Adaptex Fabric Technology in every HILU.\n\nWhat does this mean?",
      "Pretty cool, isn\u2019t it? Or should we say hot?",
      "Whether it's hot outside or you're just overdressed (in bed, yes, that happens to the best of us); you might wake up drenched in your own sweat. You won't have to worry about that with HILU.\n\nHILU absorbs the heat from your body and dissipates the heat within the fiber, preventing the build-up of humidity, and keeping you dry all night long.",
      "This blanket made of pure graphene fiber is not only incredibly soft and comfortable, but it's also anti-microbial and anti-bacterial.\n\nYou won't have to worry about getting sick from germs on your blanket because it stays fresh and clean for longer.",
      "HILU blankets are made from a gentle, soft fabric that doesn't irritate your skin despite the power-packed graphene technology.\n\nConsider it like the sandman\u2019s magic inspiring beautiful dreams and putting you to sleep softly every single time.",
      "When HILU was developed, we determine to bring a new standard in the sleep industry. We are the best in the business and we are so confident with the superior craftsmanship that we are backing it up with a TEN (10) YEAR WARRANTY.\n\nThat's right, a whole ten years! We want you to have peace of mind knowing that HILU will be there with you for the long haul.",
      "No matter how cold or short the days grow, you don't have to give up your wanderlust. With a temperature-regulating blanket, you can stay cozy and warm wherever you go.\n\nTake HILU with you on all your adventures, from camping in the mountains to stargazing on a cold winter night. HILU is the perfect companion for any outdoor activity.",
      "Made to make your sleep better, snuggles cozier and life easier, HILU is also super simple to care for. If your HILU gets a little dirty, just machine wash on gentle with cold water and tumble dry low or line dry. That\u2019s it!\n\nYour HILU will stay as soft, cozy, and cuddly as the day you got. Even after 10 years of usage and many washings.",
      "Video of testimonials",
      "Each one of us in our team tried different ways to look forward to a good night's rest, but somehow nothing has worked.. We figured to get together to make a ridiculously awesome blanket that will solve the billion-dollar problem\u2014how can we all get the best sleep of our lives every night..",
      "We combined all our extensive experience* that combined science, design, and engineering to make a revolutionary smooth and silky fabric with natural temperature regulating properties. A material that regulates our body temperature through the night so we get the perfect night sleep.",
      "With the silky feel and super durability to match, HILU was born. It really should cost an arm and a leg, but the team really just wanted to have good sleep so they figured to make it as affordable as possible to share HILU with everyone.",
      "* FYI it's really the experience and work of Scott, Gilad, and James\u2026ssshhh but Ricardo and laura did made sure to put the word out to tell everyone about HILU.",

      "Bite Into Comfort: The Pierogi Bucket - Ohio City's New Comfort Food Favorite",
      "My name is Miroslav, and I've worked in the service industry for over 20 years - from hotels like Marriott and Hilton to both fast food and upscale restaurants. For the past two and a half years I've been with Perla Pierogies, where I created and developed the Pierogi Bucket concept. Originally from Eastern Europe, I've always been passionate about culinary traditions and sharing comforting, authentic flavors in new and acceptable ways.",
      "This campaign is important to me because The Pierogi Bucket is a way to share a food tradition I love in a playful, modern format. It's more than just a food project - it's a reflection of my background and a chance to grow something meaningful from the ground up.",
      "The Pierogi Bucket is a fresh, fast, and fun take on comfort food - served in a bucket and packed with flavor. With your support, we can launch as a ghost kitchen or pop-up in Ohio City, build awareness, and lay the groundwork for a permanent location. Your contribution will help turn a proven idea into a local favorite.",
      "We're seeking $30,000 to cover early startup costs of launching The Pierogi Bucket in Ohio City. This includes: renting space in commercial kitchen or partnering with a restaurant for pop-up hours, food prep, supplies, packaging, marketing, and basic equipment.",
      "Perks for backers: a custom Pierogi Bucket sticker to say thank you, voucher (s) redeemable for food once we launch, a signed copy of my \"PIEROGI!\" book at select contribution levels.",
      "Even if we don't reach the full goal, partial funding will still help us bring The Pierogi Bucket to Ohio City through pop-ups. This concept is already being served and loved at Perla Pierogies in Parma - now it's time to introduce it to a wider audience and prepare for a dedicated location in Ohio City.",
      "This isn't just another takeout concept - it's a way to bring regional comfort food to more people in a fun, convenient format. At the heart of The Pierogi Bucket is a simple idea: fried Perla Minis, served in a playful bucket with kielbasa. It's fast, satisfying, and easy to enjoy. Handmade pierogi and select sides will be available, but the core of the concept is the bucket - familiar, sharable, and built for simplicity.",
      "What makes this campaign different is that The Pierogi Bucket isn't just an idea - it already has a proven track record. We've been running a small version of the concept at Perla Pierogies in Parma, where it well received by customers and performs especially well on delivery platforms.",
      "By supporting this campaign, you're not just backing a concept - you're helping bring a working, well-received food idea into a new neighborhood where it can grow. That makes a real difference, and you'll be part of the story form the beginning",
      "Like any new venture, there are uncertainties - such as finding the right kitchen partner, balancing early production costs, and getting the word our in a new neighborhood. But I've spent over two decades in the service industry and two and a half years with Perla Pierogies, where I developed and refined this concept. I understand how to run lean, stay flexible, and deliver consistently good food.",
      "Our plan is to start with low-overhead pop-ups in available restaurant kitchens - this gives a chance to build interest, adjust based on feedback, and grow organically. We're not rushing into a permanent lease until we know we're ready.",
      "Even if you can't contribute financially, you can still support us by: sharing this campaign with friends and local food fans, following us on social media and help build awareness, using Indiegogo's share tools to spread the word and encourage others to join in. Every bit of support helps us get closer to making The Pierogi Bucket a reality in Ohio City!",

      "The RIMIT Kit allows you to rim up your favourite cocktails anywhere, anytime in seconds!",
      "We want to thank you so much for taking the time to check out our kickstarter.",
      "My name is Rob Cox , I am the Founder and President of RIMIT. People ask me all the time, \"How did you come up with this idea?\" The honest truth is, one day in August 2018, I woke up at 3am and the exact vision of what RIMIT is today was in my head. My guess would be after years of suffering from drinking Caesars from a can without rimmer, the universe worked its magic and gave me the solution to my problem.",
      "Although my background had been in the Landscaping industry for the previous 15 years, I had always been an entrepreneur, owning  businesses in different categories such as a Real estate Investing in Canada and Nicaragua, Granite Counter Tops and few others so I knew extensive research was needed to determine if we should pursue the idea of RIMIT. We quickly realized there may just be a high demand for RIMIT. The problem that we solved with RIIMIT wasn\u2019t just so that consumers could now add rimmer to there canned cocktails but they could now enjoy a fully rimmed cocktails anywhere, anytime in just seconds. And they can do this without their lips having to come in contact with germ covered cans.",
      "But RIMIT was just the beginning. We quickly discovered that there was another problem that we needed to solve. In order to be able to enjoy a fully rimmed cocktail anywhere, anytime in just seconds, the lime juice and rimmer needs to be readily available. It just takes too much time and makes too much mess to have to get out the bowls, rimmer, lime juice and pour them into the bowls just to rim up a couple of cocktails. Then once your done, you now have rimmer and lime juice that both go to waste and you have dishes to do.",
      "The Solution was The RIMIT Kit. Our patent pending 2 in 1 compact, leak-proof rimmer kit allows you to rim up your cocktails anywhere, anytime in just seconds.",
      "The idea of The RIMIT Kit was born just a couple months after RIMIT but The RIMIT Kit needed about 18 months of R&D to get it just perfect. The original thought of The RIMIT Kit would be a small compact 2 in 1 rimmer kit that could fit in your pocket and would only be compatible with the RIMIT. After 18 months of R&D, it was clear that we had to make it just big enough to be compatible with any standard household drinking glass and of course, RIMIT. But it still had to be compact, leak-proof and easily transportable. Not like the standard bar top rimmer trays. So we ended up with this!",
      "Our patent and Trade Mark pending products both RIMIT and The RIMIT Kit were invented to provide more convenience and a quicker solution for preparing fully rimmed cocktails anywhere, anytime in just seconds. All of our products are Made with FDA approved polypropylene, they are BPA Free, Dish Washer Friendly, Recyclable but more importantly they are Reusable. We encourage our customers to wash and reuse our products to minimize waste.",
      "The RIMIT Kit comes with 130 Grams of co-branded Lucky\u2019s Rim Job Rimmer. All you have to do is add 1 ounce of lime juice to the lime juice compartment. The RIMIT Kit can be easily transported via cooler bags, back packs, purses ect. It loves to be stored in the fridge to keep the lime juice fresh.",
      "In todays busy world, there never seems to be enough time in a day. To us, it makes more sense to spend less time preparing cocktails and creating dishes and spend more time enjoying your favorite cocktails with friends and family.",
      "So whether your looking to enjoy a Caesar, Michelada, Margarita, Bloody Mary at home, at the cottage, the beach, camping, golfing or backyard get togethers, RIMIT and The RIMIT Kit allows you to conveniently enjoy fully rimmed cocktails in just seconds.",
      "We officially launched RIMIT in August 2019 and sales plus co-branded partnerships have taken off for us including a collaboration with Mott\u2019s Clamato Caesar\u2019s. Now it is time to introduce The RIMIT Kit. We have already selected our Manufacturer and our moulds are currently being fabricated. We are on schedule to be in full production by the middle of August this year and now we need your help to get our first manufacturing run off the ground so please back this campaign so we can launch The RIMIT Kit and Elevate your cocktail experience.",

We are aiming to start shipping by the end of March, and while we will do our best to deliver earlier without compromising on quality, we will also keep you updated throughout the entire process.",
      "Of course, the design process of The Prule was not without its challenges. Initially, our goal was simple: to create a folding ruler. But how could we make it more innovative and unique? We pondered over this question and came up with an idea \u2013 using the folding mechanism to create a simple yet precise protractor. By simply adding scales and gears to the ruler, when the concept became true, we thought, \"Bang, it worked!\"",
      "Here is the initial sketch of the Prule:",
      "With a clear vision in mind, we moved into the design phase. We sketched numerous concepts, refined them through CAD modeling, and focused on integrating the folding mechanism with the protractor function. Titanium alloy was chosen for its lightweight strength and corrosion resistance, ensuring that the ruler could withstand the rigors of professional use while maintaining a sleek and elegant appearance.",
      "With the help of 3D printing technology, we created multiple prototypes for physical testing and functional verification. User feedback was invaluable, guiding us to make further improvements. We iterated on the design, optimizing ergonomics, aesthetics, and the overall user experience.",
      "3D printing",
      "3D printed product",
      "Eventually, after numerous rounds of testing and refinement, we successfully crafted a final prototype that embodied our vision.

      "Designed to smartly carry your valuables on quick runs.",
      "Runners care a lot about product performance.  In the making of FITLY, we logged hundreds of miles, challenging every inch of every component.  We are proud to say that FITLY has the most cutting-edge components available today.",
      "FITLY is a World's First with its totally awesome patent pending Thoracic Belt System: two subpectoral front pockets attached to a stretch belt that retracts slightly so all items are kept in place when you run and are naturally accessible without affecting your running form.",
      "We are sometimes asked whether FITLY is designed for man and woman.  The upper straps are adjustable.  You can see in the animation below that this particular runner wears FITLY fairly high.  She could have lowered the thoracic belt at least 4 inches/ 10 cm, making it totally fine for both man and woman and even below your cardio.",
      "Picture yourself running. Your hands naturally swing by your thorax making it very convenient to store and retrieve small personal items in the two subpectoral pockets without any impact on your running form. No need to stop or modify your gait to securely store a car key your friend just handed to you or to retrieve a gel.",
      "The Thoracic Belt has a gentle stretch (retraction force) which locks all items in place. Nothing moves. No bouncing is possible and the retraction force is calculated to be soft enough to not affect breathing.",
      "This Patent Pending invention is incredibly useful during vigorous activities, especially runners who want to safely carry a few personal items.",
      "The right pocket has three mini-slots to put away loose coins, a key, lip balm stick, or maybe a beautiful shell you pick up during your morning run so they do not rattle during your peaceful run!",
      "The Fidlock system combines two fastening concepts in one: a magnetic snap and a mechanical lock that clips tightly around 1 of 3 positions, offering useful adjustments while on the run.",
      "Cell phones are important for security, communication, music, orientation and training logs (apps).  They're so essential, we see people running with them in their hands daily. When asked if they'd prefer to stick it in FITLY and the reaction is always the same.",
      "Cell phones are expensive, what if it rains?   You need to protect it!",
      "FITLY's Phone Slot is exactly designed to host your cell phone with two significant advantages over almost any other solution:",
      "With today's headphone button, voice control, and smartwatches, hundreds of phone commands are readily available without the need to stop and access your phone:  Play Music, Skip, Answer/hang up, Call home, Play Radio, Hear messages, etc. Your phone is tucked away, entirely protected from the weather yet perfectly available.",
      "Constructed using high tenacity military-grade fiber technologies, the CORDURA\u00ae fabric is exceptionally durable and puncture resistant.",
      "Our prototypes have been used hundreds of time, under heavy rain, and gallons of sweat with no sign of deterioration.  The fabric is \"best in class\", used in high-end mountain guide equipment, made to endure the toughest weather.",
      "FITLY IS MADE TO LAST!",
      "S.Caf\u00e9\u00ae is an eco-friendly (Cradle to Cradle certified) soft fabric that combines nylon yarns and recycled ground coffee at the cellular level. The fascinating benefit is natural odor resistance.  Green innovation is a win-win!  The S.Caf\u00e9\u00ae fabric also naturally cools your skin temperature down!",

      "All you need for a quick run precisely fits in one of FITLY\u2019s multiple compartments.",
      "All water resistant.",
      "NB: We have posted a list of items designed to be stored for each pocket sizes at the bottom of the page.",
      "Using the steadiness of your upper back and chest area, FITLY\u2019s X-Shape distributes the weight to snugly fit your body contour.  It allows free running movements while preserving total body symmetry.",
      "A pleasant feeling of wearing almost nothing\u2026",
      "FITLY has five easy adjustments to make it your own:",
      "Drizzle or pour, the PU-coated Cordura fabric is water-resistant. It does not make FITLY waterproof but resistant to endure the toughest weather!",
      "No need to time the weather, postpone a work-out or try to outrun the oncoming storm.  No need for a plastic bag either!  Just keep on running and know your valuables are protected.  Very useful!",
      "Front and back safety reflective bands as well as silver reflective logos for your night adventures. See and be seen!",
      "Also available is a 2-inch long webbing to attach an additional light.  It is especially important for bikers on an early morning ride.",
      "Trivial but important, we placed a mini whistle directly in the front pocket so it can be immediately accessed.",
      "FITLY is a running accessory made for quick runs. The majority of people (85%) we surveyed run with 2 or more items, the most frequent are Cell Phones and keys (car, house, hotel).",
      "Of the 15% remaining, half would prefer having their cell phone for security and communication in the case of an incident but had not found a suitable way to carry it.",
      "For longer runs, where hydration and heavier gear affects performance, lots of options already exist.  Hydration is important but less of a focus in short runs (sub 45 min).  You can carry 130 ml/4.4 oz jugs or flasks in one of the front pockets and about 3X as much in the secret pocket.",
      "...you can do less!",
      "Light and thin FITLY is also a clever solution to carry small personal items for travel, day trips, and less vigorous activities, such as kayaking, walking, hiking or just a visit to the museum or a city event. For travel, stick your passport or wallet in the \u201csecret\u201d side pocket for added protection. Wear your FITLY under your jacket for complete security.",
      "Three different color accents and 2 sizes.",
      "FITLY covers sizes from 26 In/67 cm to 40 In/102 cm (under breast measurement), which spans from XS to XL.  Once you have pledged, we will reach out to you for your color and size selections.",
      "Since we launched FITLY, we have gathered 1000+ Positive Feedbacks!",
      "Some were goosebumps worthy:",
      "\u201cI love FITLY! I\u2019ve tried multiple running belts and bags and they all ride up or move once I get going. And the material never seems to keep my phone safe from moisture. FITLY stayed snug, fit comfortably, and it kept my phone dry!\u201d",
      "\"FITLY is extraordinary, a true gift to the running community\".",
      "\"I wanted to keep the prototype I tested!\".",
      "\u201cI have been a runner my entire life and FITLY is one of the best product I\u2019ve ever used. I can jog or sprint with my wallet, phone, and keys and it won\u2019t move even with the added weight. It feels just like a part of your body\u201d.",
      "\"I am running every other day after work and from work. I absolutely need my phone and have to take my car key with me. I tested FITLY. Nothing ever moves and my phone is 100% protected even when it rains. NEED ONE!\".",
      "Jean-Marc created it. Yohan designed it. Nicolas made it happen technically. Olag gave it a beautiful visual identity. Nicolas made the world aware of it and David is about to fabricate it!  All above average experts in their respective fields.",
      "FITLY is a reality thanks to their dedication and selfless generosity.",

      "Are you interrupted by sounds from the surrounding environment  and have to lower the microphone gain?",
      "Do you spend a lot of time checking the plugs for each audio device?",
      "Are you putting up with the unreasonably high price of brand-name audio ports, but their functions are monotonous and average?",
      "Yes? You may need our Commander M1 audio interface and the audio equipment bundle. They will help you increase productivity, take your skills to the next level. It allows you to focus on creating content instead of fighting with some emotionless device. Get ready to enjoy your immersive creations without worrying about running out of battery.",

You can use it with almost all applications. It is free-drive, plug and play. We specifically designed this to free you from the tedious setup of traditional audio equipment, allowing you to focus on your audio production. It is ideal for use with popular software applications and network platforms such as, OBS, Audacity, Adobe Audition, and video platforms like YouTube, Twitch, Tiktok, Facebook Live, and Uplive.",
      "The button to the right of the power button turns on the screen and button backlights. There are 4 levels of the display lights. In level 1, the screen and button backlights are brightest. In level 2, the button backlights and screen are at medium level. In level 3, the screen and button backlights are at the lowest level of brightness. In level 4, the button backlights are off, and the screen backlight at the lowest level of brightness. The system default is level 1. You can see all of the indication icons changing on the LED screen.",
      "There are 6 small knobs on the top of the M1 panel: TRE, MID, BASS knobs are for manually adjusting the tone of your voice from the microphone. The PITCH knob is for adjusting the pitch of the 4 voice-changer modes and HOST, SING, OST 3 sound modes.The MUSIC knob is for adjusting the volume of accompanying music (this includes Bluetooth music and wired input music from the MUSIC port). MONITOR is for adjusting the volume of the headphones and speaker. 2 large knobs. REVERB adjusts the reverb/echo effects of your voice from microphones.

      "In the middle of the bottom half of the panel, there are 3 slider knobs. The left slider is for adjusting the volume of MIC L group (MIC L1, MIC L2). The mute button is for mute the two mics. The right slider and right mute button are doing the same for MIC R group (MIC R1, MIC R2). The middle slider is for adjusting the volume of instrument.",
      "The red +48V button has nothing to do with the INST slider. The +48V button is the on/off 48V phantom power. It will add 48 volts to the left and right mics (MICL1 and MIC R1). MIC L1 port and MIC R1 port are for 48V condenser microphones. Only when you open red +48V button, the two MIC ports will start work. MIC L2 and MIC R2 are for 5V condenser microphones or dynamic microphones. The microphones in our bundles are condenser. If you want to use your own dynamic mic, you need to switch MIC SETTING to dynamic.",
      "The left 12 silicone buttons are functions. Among the 12 buttons, the 4 black buttons are the 7 sound modes (only change mode for the sound which comes from microphones): Male, female, child, robbot, host, sing and original sound tape. Press the button to switch the mode.",
      "The red COMMANDER button implements all the setting of MUSIC, MONITOR, REVERB, OUTPUT, MIC L, MIC R, INST and sound mode buttons/knobs. It will set to a professionally designed default setting created by professional audio engineers. It is to help the user quickly start to use the audio interface.Bluetooth is for turning on/off the connection of the Bluetooth device. MUTE silences all sound.Press the DNR to switch to levels 1 and 2 of noise reduction. AUTO TUNE is for switching the microphone to auto tune. It included 12 modes: Ab, A, Bb, B, C, Db, D, Eb, E, F, Gb, G. MUSIC ONLY removes the singer`s voice from a song, leaving only the background music. When you use a computer with M1, if you turn on LOOP BACK, the sound from computer will not output to M1. During live streaming, your audience will not hear the sound from your computer. SIDE CHAIN lowers the volume of accompanying music when you talk from the microphone in order to highlight your speaking.",

It will set to a professionally designed default setting created by professional audio engineers. It is to help the user immediately start using the audio interface.",
      "Based on past sales experience, we know that many YouTubers and podcasters need to record long intro clips, and play it on repeat at the beginning or end of their audio/video. However, most competitors` audio interface only have 1MB to 5MB storage volume. They can record and store the audio for only 10 to 40 seconds. And their sound quality is greatly reduced compared to the M1. Their sample rate is only 11KHz to 24KHz. Our Commander M1 has a built-in 64MB super large flash storage. Large storage volume allows us to keep important and necessary things. We can ensure that the saved audio sample rate is kept above 44.1KHz (CD quality). Also you can record and store more than 800 seconds of audio in our audio interface`s DIY sound effect buttons. We provide 16 removable tags that make it easy for users to tag each DIY SFX button. We made sure to far surpass the competition and guarantee customer satisfaction.",
      "The design inspiration for this feature also comes from our after-sales service experience. Many customers ask our after-sales service team why their audio interface doesn\u2019t output the sound, or why they can\u2019t hear any sound from earphones. As our customer service patiently helped them find the reason, the customer suddenly found that the plug was not fully inserted. This is a simple problem that many competitors overlook. To prevent our users from facing this situation, we added the connection detection system on the M1 display screen. It can help you check the connection status of PC, PHONE, INSTRUMENT and CHARGE. If they are connected, you will see their icons on the top line of LED screen. If you cannot see the icon, that indicates your device is poorly connected or not connected at all.",
      "STU1 and STU1+ microphone kit",
      "We have 2 kinds of microphones for the bundle. STU1 is a 5V cardioid condenser microphone, the mic capsule is 16mm. The response frequency range is from 50Hz to 18KHz.  Maximum SPL is 120dB. S/N ratio is 70dB. Sensitivity is -38\u00b12dB (0dB=1V/Pa at 1KHz). STU1+ is a 48V cardioid condenser microphone, the mic capsule is 25mm. The response frequency range is from 20Hz to 20KHz. Maximum SPL is 134dB. S/N ratio is 70dB. Sensitivity is -40\u00b12dB (0dB=1V/Pa at 1KHz).",
      "We have specially designed the microphone boom arm and mic shock mount to maximize ease of use and to optimize the appearance. It's not the same as a traditional mic stand and shock mount. Our product does not have any unnecessary parts that are often a burden on the customer. After you adjust it to the proper posture, it will remain in place and looks like a work of art. All of this, of course, is absolutely in line with the latest aesthetic sense of symmetry. There are 5 small cable holders to help you to hide the microphone cable in to the gap between the dual arms. This design greatly improves the appearance of your desktop.",
      "D1 monitor headphones",
      "Our headphones are professional-grade monitor headphones. They have two 50mm speaker driver units. The impedance is 32\u03a9, the sensitivity is 98\u00b13dB. The frequency response range is 10Hz-38KHz. We designed it to have a sharp clean look that is pleasing to the eye, while being an absolute comfort to the ears. It can pick up the lowest and highest frequencies, as it is much more sensitive than the human ear. You will experience complete sound immersion with the D1 Monitor Headphones.",
      "The headphones have two extra-large (inner diameter 65mm, outer diameter 100mm) ear covers. And they are made of extremely comfortable soft sponge. It comes with a 4 meter coiled headphone cable. There is a lock affixed on the connection of the cable terminal to avoid accidentally pulling out the headphone plug during use. This is one of the most common customer complaints we have solved. Because the cables are super strong and super long (3.5mm diameter, 12ft) and the spring like cord is not easy to tangle, you can get on with your recording without having to worry about the cord disconnecting, tangling, or getting in the way.",
      "Whether your hearing is above average or normal, you\u2019ll get an immersive listening experience unlike anything you\u2019ve ever had before.",
      "We have overcome many difficulties while perfecting overall appearance, the fine structural details, structural design, electrical engineering, software engineering and audio engineering. After 11 months of design and development and many, many iterations, we finally completed the first version. We have modified the appearance and structural design of the audio interface more than 300+ times. Externally, we went through 19 major changes. These caused us to restart over and over again. For the electronic engineering and software engineering, we also went through 600+ attempts. We now want you to hear what perfection sounds like.",
      "Pictures alone can not tell the story of the tireless dedication of our audio engineers. The sound quality of the Commander M1 has to be heard to be understood. Making each audio channel successfully cooperate with each function forced us to make the impossible possible. The electrical and audio engineers needed to solve a maze of issues to come up with a sound quality that is second to none.",

      "Crowdfunding Hamilton's newest & sweetest ice cream shop!",
      "Almost exactly a year ago I began my journey with Realfruity, popping up across Hamilton on the fruitybike & having the absolute time of my life. If you told me last June I\u2019d be working on opening a shop less than a year later, I\u2019d say you\u2019re nuts. But it\u2019s really happening. So many 'pinch me' moments in the past few weeks.",
      "Realfruity has always been about more than just ice cream & the shop will be no different. This is not your average ice cream store. This will be a space driven by community, FUN & quality feel-good ice cream. Westdale has been my home for 8 years now & I\u2019m excited to bring another space to the village that\u2019s focused on bringing people together. A cozy, happy, & inclusive place for people to gather. Cause that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.",
      "As I work with my friends to bring the space to life, I\u2019m trying my best to avoid borrowing from the banks & instead fund a good portion of this project by the community of realfruity supporters, the people who love ice cream & good vibes. The space I'm currently renovating was a cell phone shop before, essentially a blank canvas. So much to do, so much to build, so many ideas. Your contribution will help me bring elite equipment to Realfruity, upgrade the space to match the Realfruity vibe & truly bring this dream across the finish line. Any support you can offer is incredibly appreciated. I'm offering 3 Perk levels that make you a part of the Realfruity Founders Club. Each level comes with an equivalent gift card match, exclusive little perks & endless bragging rights. Read each description for more info.",
      "I've signed the lease & began the renovations. Like I mentioned before, this is a blank canvas. What was once a cell phone store is becoming an ice cream shop. Sadly I did not have the winter to plan out what the shop will look like, & how it will operate. This has all been so wildly unexpected. Day-by-day I'm creating my dream space by taking a very DIY approach to the renovations and design. I've involved the ones I love most on the project, my biggest supporters & the biggest realfruity fans. Amazing what people will do when you feed them ice cream. When it's all ready to go, you'll be visiting a space that has been curated with a whole lot of love by a collection of really awesome people. Yes, maybe it's taking a bit longer by this method, but that's the realfruity way. Community, friends, love & enjoying the process. The plans are being put to work, the ice cream bar, seating area, prep space, bike storage, & more.",
      "Do not worry, the bike will live on stronger than ever, popping up at events, parks, markets, parties, weddings, festivals & more, taking realfruity far & wide! The bike is such a big part of the brand & will pedal on forever, it's my pride & joy!",
      "You'll see the same real fruit ice cream & froyo you know & love but this time made-to-order with a new, elite (and very expensive) machine from New Zealand. This is the Ferrari of real fruit machines & I can promise is something you've probably never seen before. Providing the highest of quality and the prettiest of swirls. I hope to offer some delicious and unique hot treats, refreshing sparkling drinks & fun to-go ice cream cups with creative flavours I wasn't able to do before.",
      "Thank you for taking the time to consider contributing. If you\u2019ve supported realfruity in the past, whether through the purchase of an ice cream, inviting me to an event, or offering beautiful words of encouragement & excitement, thank you from the bottom of my heart. This is because of you.",

      "Super Stability & Super Handling make even the choppiest waters feel like silky smooth riding.",
      "XFoil 2 is a carbon fiber electric watercraft that can glide on the surface and fly above the water for riding in lakes, rivers, and oceans. It's the world's first hydrofoil with a computer-controlled gyro system with active moving control surfaces designed to automatically cancel turbulent waters/wind. XFoil's new game-changing technology, derived from fighter jets, enables super stability and super handling, making even the choppiest waters feel like silky smooth riding.",
      "\"We created XFoil because an awesome watercraft should not only be accessible to the elite. Everyone should be able to have a superior, no compromise top end hydrofoil at an affordable price.\" -Paul Lowchareonkul (XFoil Founder)",
      "*Spec based on Performance Long Range battery option.",
      "XFoil's gyro stability system, called \"Omega,\" implements technology derived from fighter jets. Central to the system is a 6-axis gyro that automatically senses changes in roll, pitch, and yaw, and counteracts these external forces 1000 times faster than any human, delivering the smoothest, most maneuverable, and easiest-to-ride hydrofoil ever created. The computer system enhances your control rather than working against it. You remain in full control, but with significant improvements.",
      "Today's hydrofoils are severely limited in their capabilities. Without moving control surfaces, similar to a hang glider, the rider's weight distribution on the craft is the sole means available for control. This method has limited effectiveness, as gusty winds for hang gliders and turbulent waters or winds for hydrofoils make stable control nearly impossible and dangerous to operate. XFoil's dynamic wings, derived from fighter jet technology, surpass fixed wings in nearly every aspect.",
      "XFoil is designed to be the easiest board to learn on. Whether you're a beginner or an expert to water sports, XFoil allows you to build riding confidence in progressive steps.  Learn on your own time and progress to the next riding style whenever you feel comfortable.",
      "XFoil can transform from a powered surfboard that rides on the surface of the water to a Hydrofoil board that rides above the water. Standup paddle board (SUP) configuration is also available for a pure foil riding experience. The electric motor can be attached to different mast assemblies to suit your desired riding preference.",
      "XFoil measures just 65.5 inches (166 cm) long, and is shorter than child size surf boards.",
      "XFoil 2 conveniently fits into mid-size sedans making transport to any water destination virtually effortless. The board weighs only 34 LBS (15.4 Kg)*.",
      "XFoil's lightweight carbon fiber construction is 5x stronger and 5x lighter than steel. Unlike other EFoils manufactured from inferior materials like fiberglass, EPS plastic, foam, or air inflatable, XFoil only uses the best hand-laid carbon fiber engineered to absorb waves, increase lift, and minimize drag while delivering unsurpassed comfort and control.",
      "Industry's smallest, and lightest eFoil wireless controller. Latest Bluetooth, magnetic touch trigger, and an OLED display. Waterproof IP68 can be submersed beyond 1m. Data telemetry, cruise control, anti-runaway, supreme control with multiple user profiles. Built-in lithium battery can operate up to 45 hours on a single charge with built-in wireless charger.",
      "XFoil 2 includes a 6000W (8HP) brushless maintenance free motor that can be detached with our patent pending mast attachment assembly allowing you to achieve surf, foil and SUP configurations by simply moving the motor from one mast to the other.",
      "Having the option for a detachable motor allows for future motor upgrades when new technologies emerge and makes it easier to service. The motor is Direct Drive. This means that the motor directly drives the propeller without the use of gears. Gears reduce the power transfer efficiency and creates unnecessary noise that disturb swimmers, sea life, etc. XFoil's direct drive system coupled with the High Performance Propeller is silent, making it the quietest EFoil.",
      "New Competition Toroidal Propeller (Shown Above)",
      "New Gen 2 lithium batteries for up to 160 minutes of ride time. Industry's highest voltage eFoil batteries operating up to 67.2V (14% higher than the nearest competitors). Higher voltage means less heat, better efficiency, more power on tap and longer run times.",
      "Utilizing the latest top grade cells with unsurpassed energy and power density while maintaining super light weight housed in aluminum armor. Standard Range batteries are lighter (15 LBS) ideal for sessions about 80 minutes. Long Range Performance battery is heavier great for long distance travel and sessions over 2.5 hours.",
      "XFoil has many mast configurations to choose from depending on your riding style",
      "XFoil's metal components are made from aircraft grade anodized 6061-T6 aluminum for superior strength, rigidity, corrosion resistance and lightweight.",
      "We've engineered the best in class Hydrofoil to outperform the competition in every category. Through this campaign only you get a top end product direct from the manufacturer with no middlemen or dealer markups. XFoil is engineered in Silicon Valley, California designed to outperform.",

    "allParagraphs": [
      "Pero can make your smart devices even smarter.",
      "Introducing Pero, a wearable controller that makes your smart devices even smarter. Pero turns your simple hand motions into customizable shortcuts for your device. Now, you can control the cursor and input commands with this single device so that you can focus more on getting the job done.",
      "AAD function | Active Applicaiton Detection",
      "PERO can perform Active Application Detection through the User Custom Program. You can send separate commands according to each application, even with the same gesture.",
      "Provide customized settings according to gesture usage patterns",
      "Our \u201cUser Support Program\u201d analyzes your natural gesture habits and patterns to learn your command preferences. Instead of fitting your needs to predefined shortcuts, make your own shortcuts that meet your exact needs!",
      "Pero lets you control the user-interface with just your gestures alone.",
      "Yes, just like Minority Report but better. Since this is real. Turn your simple hand motions into customizable shortcuts for your device.",
      "We manage applications by type.",
      "UCP can manage many applications easily by dividing types according to popular shortcuts and commands. And new applications can be updated faster. These advantages, combined with the AAD function, help effectively control the commands of the application through the Pero.",
      "* Pero is not fully compatible with drone control at the moment. The video above is a demo test.",
      "Pero also gives you full range cursor control. It does everything you want your mouse to do and more.",
      "Comfortable Wrist",
      "The positioning of the arm while using Pero prevents the build up of pressure and pain in the wrist. But Ordinary mice force the wrist into a bent shape  which causes discomfort and pain over time",
      "When working with a mouse, you have to always work in the same pose and posture. However, you can work in a variety of poses and poses.",
      "PERO does not need space to control the cursor.",
      "So Pero reduces the time you spend moving between the mouse and trackpad. It also helps you use your computer efficiently even in a desk-free working environment.",
      "Think of the diverse purpose that each finger serves. The subtle differences in a tap, press, and pinch. The array of meanings they convey. We took the admiration of our nifty fingers to heart by utilizing their full potential in Pero. Its highly sensitive touch sensor recognizes each individual fingertip and when they\u2019re being pressed down.",
      "Simply connect it just like connect your wireless earbuds, easy and effortless! No external receiver needed. And PERO uses BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). So you can use 37 hours on a 30-minute charge.",
      "UCP is our team's best gift to PERO buyers.",
      "And so, after years of research and development, I came up with a device that could recognize gestures and translate it into specific commands. This is how Pero was born in 2017, but the current version of Pero is the most popular version among the people who participated in our user experience research tests (28 touch panel silicon insertion tests, 28 touch panel types, 9 product designs, 8 board modifications, and 8 sets of molds produced). We are doing our best and will continue to work hard in order to create innovative products that will provide incredible value for anyone!",
      "In order to make a recognition panel that can accurately recognize gestures even when worn roughly, a capacitive touch sensor was included in the design. However, it was necessary to make a panel to block the natural static electricity that can form in the palm while simultaneously recognizing the static electricity on the fingers. Eventually, we were able to succeed and ended up creating a thin but powerful discernment panel that accomplished everything we wanted it to accomplish.",
      "User support software is where we focused a lot of our efforts in order to make it easy and simple for anyone to use. In the future, we planning on further developing the software so that more third-party applications are integrated and that additional customized gestures can be recognized. In order to reach this next step, we will try to develop motion recognition optimization by making sure that Pero outputs can be analyzed by 2,800 data bits per second.",
      "Risks and challenges",
      "Our team has prepared to launch a crowdfunding for months. We understand that there are risks and challenges involved with launching and fulfilling a crowdfunding. In order to prevent any mistakes from occurring, we have partnered with several crowdfunding experts to cover each aspect of our campaign. That means that from campaign transparency to fulfilling rewards, we have every base covered. However, since this is our first time creating a product of this scale, there may be some unforeseen hurdles that we may have to overcome. If issues do arise and impact the quality of the product or delay the shipment of rewards then we will do our best to overcome the problem and be completely transparent with our backers.",

      "Fill from up top & let nature do the rest for automated, zero connectivity home gardening",
      "Humanity is accelerating towards 3D high-rise living, while continuing to rely on a 2D landscape of conventional agriculture. We're on a mission to revolutionize the way we grow from home. Your support will bring this game-changing solution to the world.",
      "Need",
      "Even food marketed as local presupposes the production and transportation of massive amounts of packaging. This food first has to reach you, then your home. Homegrown is ideal, but we need a simpler, more versatile solution",
      "Problem",
      "Current vertical farming solutions are often wasteful and cumbersome. Garden Stack eliminates any need for constant connectivity, pumps, fans, plugs, and apps. Let's harness nature's potential without damaging it in the process.",
      "Method",
      "Garden Stack is a groundbreaking fusion of traditional olla irrigation in a modern vertical farm. You simply fill it from the top, and your plants receive optimized, hyper-efficient irrigation. Forget plug and play: Try unplug and forget.",
      "Benefits",
      "Your plants' roots will draw the water they need through the slightly porous central tube. Olla irrigation is way more efficient than even drip irrigation. Forget over- and under-watering. This is a healthy habit you'll actually want to keep.",
      "History",
      "Olla irrigation has been utilized for thousands of years, from China to Rome. Remarkably, it remains the most efficient soil irrigation technique to this day, surpassing drip irrigation and rivaling hydroponics. It's time to rediscover the power of ollas.",
      "Design",
      "Garden Stack features an intuitive, 8-part numbered design that assembles and irrigates effortlessly, turning you into a pro gardener. We'll provide online tutorials for anyone looking for more detailed tips & guidance.",
      "Delivery plan",
      "We plan on shipping by the end of 2023. A standard Garden Stack device weighs under 2 pounds (under 1 kilo) and fits in a small package\u2014comparable to a board game\u2014thanks to our nested design. This will make shipping that much easier.",
      "Materials & Sustainability",
      "We believe in localized, green manufacturing. So Garden Stack will be 3D printed in-house, instead of outsourcing to an offshore factory. The universe of 3D print materials is bustling and exciting (check out our blog!). We'll always pick sustainable options.",
      "Add-ons",
      "We're offering multiple upgrades: a water reservoir for extended automated irrigation; a pro base for water runoff and improved stability; a mirror system for passive light transmission and pest deterrence; and custom colors besides our default terracotta.",
      "Shipping details",
      "We're dedicated to creating win-win solutions. We'll match your shipping costs with discounts on Garden Stack accessories like our bonus water reservoir. With shared incentives, we'll find the best possible shipping solution for everyone.",
      "Background",
      "Daniel had the idea for Garden Stack during the first lockdown and Marta has been supporting in its development since. It's been a long road getting here, and we're excited to finally have Garden Stack ready to launch.",
      "Join Us!",

    "title": "Zenmaster: A Watch As Unique As Your Fingerprint",
    "description": "Each watch has its own unique zen garden inspired dial pattern, created using 18th-century math",
    "company_name": "Alain & Jordi from pOrtahl",
    "allParagraphs": [
      "Each watch has its own unique zen garden inspired dial pattern, created using 18th-century math",
      "Your new Zenmaster watch is one-of-a-kind. How? Based on an 18th-century concept called 'Truchet tiles', a mathematical algorithm creates a one-of-one Japanese zen garden inspired dial pattern for every Zenmaster watch we make. Your dial pattern is as uniquely yours as your fingerprint. No two watches are ever the same.",
      "Here's the complete TL;DR on why pOrtahl's Zenmaster is the next watch you are missing:",
      "ONLY during our crowdfunding campaign do you have the chance to obtain a Zenmaster with a special Founders Edition inscription on the dial. Founders Edition Zenmasters are limited to the number of backers who pre-order during our crowdfunding campaign.",
      "At pOrtahl\u00ae we create watches you are missing. We honor classic watch design while speaking a bold, modern design language\u2014and most importantly, without the sky-high price tag. Welcome to our next Indiegogo project!",
      "// All product imagery shown on our Indiegogo page was photographed using real physical prototypes of the Zenmaster watch. No AI-generated visuals or 3D renders were used. What you see is exactly what we built.",
      "In 2020, we, Jordi van Staveren (left) and Alain van den Donk (right), founded pOrtahl\u00ae with a mission: to reimagine classic watchmaking for today\u2019s world.\n\nFrustrated by the endless copies of legendary designs flooding the market, we set out to create watches that honor classic watch design while speaking a bold, new, modern design language\u2014and most importantly, without the sky-high price tag.\n\nIn 2022 we successfully launched our Peacemaker watch on Kickstarter + Indiegogo, raising over $120,000, funding us 5 times over, and as promised; delivering all Founders Edition watches to our backers. This proved our vision resonated.\n\nNow, we are writing the next chapter of pOrtahl\u00ae with Zenmaster. Join us on this adventure!",
      "Our brand name, pOrtahl\u00ae, is derived from the word \u201cportal.\u201d A gateway into another dimension. Instead of feeling stressed out, we want each little timetelling occasion to offer a brief escape from the hustle and bustle of daily life.",
      "The Zenmaster, inspired by Japanese zen gardens (\u67af\u5c71\u6c34, karesansui), embodies this philosophy. Zen gardens are designed for meditation and symbolize balance, simplicity, and peace\u2014offering a moment of calm in the midst of chaos.",
      "Subtle elements of Japanese culture and Zen Buddhism are carefully woven into the watch, inviting quiet reflection with every glance. You will find these little nods and references throughout the design, helping you tell a story about your watch to an enquiring stranger.",
      "One of the main features that sets the Zenmaster apart is its dial. Each one features a unique pattern, etched with ultimate precision to evoke the tranquillity of the carefully raked lines in a zen garden. No two watches are ever the same.",
      "WatchChris (170k subscribers)",
      "Design Atelier (27k subscribers)",
      "Our goal for the Zenmaster was to design an entry-level automatic watch, without compromising anything on quality or design. The Zenmaster had to emanate a sense of quiet luxury, while still being suited for everyday wear.",
      "We did our own sourcing, meeting with manufacturing and assembly partners in Switzerland, Hong Kong, China and the Netherlands. We have since created multiple prototypes that we have peer-reviewed, and real-world tested ourselves. We now present to you, Zenmaster. The culmination of months of research, designing, and testing.",
      "We firmly believe this is the next watch you are missing: 'The watch as unique as your fingerprint'.",
      "Let's dive into all the features we incorporated on the Zenmaster watch.",
      "Zenmaster's steel dial is one of the main attractions of this watch. Each and every Zenmaster dial is etched with its own unique pattern, reflecting the lines raked in the sand of a Japanese zen garden to evoke a sense of calm and balance.",
      "The zen patterns are created using a mathematical algorithm that is based on Truchet\u2019s 18th-century tiling concept. The result is that no two dials are ever the same, making your dial as uniquely yours as your own fingerprint.",
      "The concept of Truchet-tiles was first conceived by S\u00e9bastien Truchet, an 18th-century French mathematician and inventor. He introduced the idea of using repeating square tiles with fixed patterns that could be rotated individually to create highly intricate designs.",
      "Today, Truchet tiles are used in algorithmic design to create visually captivating and unique patterns, such as the ones found on the Zenmaster\u2019s dial.",
      "Our mathematical algorithm, based on this concept, dictates which tiles to turn and ensures that the pattern we create has never been created before, and will never be created again.",
      "The dial pattern can seem strong in photos, but in reality the lines disappear and reappear depending on how the light refracts on the dial, shifting between modest and outspoken.",
      "At pOrtahl\u00ae we love a sleek design. Our Zenmaster has a case size of 40.5 mm, and an incredibly slim case height of only 10.2 mm\u2014that's including crystal, no cheating\u2014 allowing it to slide effortlessly through any shirt sleeve.",
      "The case of the Zenmaster is crafted from highly durable coated 316L surgical grade stainless steel, with a sandblasted matte silver finish, a brushed finish along the sides, complemented by carefully polished details to communicate a sense of quiet luxury.",
      "At the heart of the design are our \u201chugger lugs\", which gracefully embrace the sides of the case. The lugs are inspired by the concept of Yin and Yang, with one lug bending slightly upward and the other down to symbolize balance.",
      "We incorporated a custom designed fluted bezel, in a sandblasted matte silver finish to perfectly blend in with the case, while adding texture. Inside of the case on the chapter ring, you'll find our Japanese lotus petal shaped markers on the 3, 6, 9 and 12 positions.",
      "Just like the case, the bracelet is made from IPH-coated surgical grade stainless steel (316L), it features a sandblasted finish with polished accents, echoing the case\u2019s contrast of textures.",
      "The bracelet is designed to have a fully integrated look, with a sleek butterfly clasp and a cleverly concealed connection to the case. In reality, the bracelet is easily interchangeable thanks to double quick-release pins.",
      "The concealed connection allows for personalization with any straight-ended 22 mm strap or bracelet, to create your own style, while still maintaining an integrated aesthetic. Check out how our Premium FKM rubber straps look on Zenmaster's case as an example!",
      "Each changeable link is secured with screw pins, a feature requested by our Facebook community of over 3,000 members. Screw pins allow for easy adjustment with the included tools. We're also throwing in 2 half links, for a perfect fit on every wrist.",
      "That means no visit to your local watch shop required for a size adjustment, you can easily size your newly unboxed Zenmaster yourself!",
      "Want to switch the bracelet out for one of our FKM Rubber straps, available in various colors that all look incredible on Zenmaster? See 'Add-ons' for more information.",
      "Why do you need a coating? You might be familiar with that dreaded moment when you look down at your favorite watch, and it has become marred with scratches, smudges, and signs of wear.",
      "Yeah, we hate that. One of our core design principles is to make watches that last lifetimes. That's why we always protect our watches with scratch-resistant coatings.",
      "It is extremely important for us that Zenmaster can be worn daily, but the thing is, a daily watch needs to endure A LOT. That's why we want Zenmaster to be able to take a beating, yet stay as pristine as the day you first unboxed it. So, we went searching for a coating that can do just that, and we found it.",
      "The Zenmaster\u2019s case, bezel, and bracelet are shielded by an A-grade Ion Plating Hardened (IPH) coating that ensures premium resilience against everyday wear and tear. With a hardness of 1,500 HV, our A-grade coating protects against scratches, fingerprints, and sweat, preserving the watch\u2019s clean matte finish.",
      "For reference, uncoated stainless steel has a hardness of only 200 HV, which means our coating increases the hardness of the stainless steel by 7.50x (!). While it doesn't mean it's indestructible, it does significantly increase Zenmaster's resistance to scratches.",
      "That way you can stay zen and maintain a scratch- and smudge-free appearance. Stay zen my friend.",
      "For the Zenmaster, we chose a tried-and-true Japanese automatic - the MIYOTA 9015 movement. The Cal. 9015 was first introduced in 2009 and is part of MIYOTA's Premium line of automatic movements.",
      "The MIYOTA 9015 is trusted by top-tier microbrands worldwide. This movement combines outstanding performance with a sleek profile, allowing the Zenmaster's case to be as slim as it is (10.2 mm including glass), while also housing a highly dependable movement with over 15 years of track record. The Cal. 9015 is well-known for its longevity, precision, and reliability.",
      "Zenmaster\u2019s rotor complements the zen garden pattern of the dial, providing a beautiful contrast to the movement, which is visible through the exhibition caseback. It is finished in rose gold IP to match the crown, indices, and hands.",
      "The Cal. 9015 gives the Zenmaster a clean sweep (8 beats per second) and offers a generous 42-hour power reserve, allowing you to take the watch off on the weekend for a quiet \"Zen Day\".",
      "The Zenmaster features sapphire crystal on both the front and the open caseback, chosen for its best-in-class clarity and durability. Ranking just below diamond on the Mohs hardness scale, sapphire crystal offers exceptional scratch resistance.",
      "Our sapphire crystal is treated with an anti-reflective coating, offering a glare-free view of your one-of-a-kind zen dial and the MIYOTA-movement from every angle.",
      "Our rose gold crown is a screw-down, a feature that was highly requested by our private community of 3,000+ members on Facebook. It features the pOrtahl\u00ae ring engraving on the side.",
      "After unscrewing the crown, it can be pulled out into three different positions; manual winding position, date-setting position and the time-setting position.",
      "The watch hands come in a rose gold IP-finish that adds warmth and sophistication to the dial, contrasting beautifully with the cool matte tones of the case.",
      "The hour and minute hands feature a classic dauphine style, a shape that originated in the mid-20th century. Its inception and increasing popularity is often credited to Patek Philippe.",
      "The seconds hand features pOrtahl\u2019s signature ring-shaped counterweight, finished with a matte silver tip.",
      "pOrtahl\u00ae offers a 2-year international warranty on our Zenmaster watch, meaning we will repair or replace your Zenmaster watch within 2 years of delivery if it suffers from any mechanical, manufacturing, or assembly defects. This warranty does not cover damages resulting from misuse, or any cosmetic damage such as scratches or marks to the finish, which under the conditions of the warranty constitute regular wear and tear. Opening the caseback outside of an authorized repair will render the warranty null and void. In the unlikely event that your Zenmaster suffers from a mechanical defect, please contact us immediately, and we will offer you a fitting solution.",
      "Further customize your Zenmaster look with a variety of FKM rubber straps. FKM rubber is highly resistant to wear and tear, which is why it's often used in the aerospace and automotive industries.",
      "You'll notice when you pick your straps up out of the box that they're unexpectedly weighty. That's because of the super high density of FKM rubber. It's the highest quality rubber you can find.",
      "You can now pick your favorite color(s) and add them to your rewards during checkout! All straps pre-ordered during our crowdfunding campaign are 41% OFF RETAIL.",
      "Just like Peacemaker, we have designed Zenmaster fully in-house. In this chapter we want to share our vision on watch design with you.",
      "At pOrtahl\u00ae we have 5 design goals that make up our design ethos for any watch that we are ever going to create.",
      "1. Your daily choice - our watches are designed for daily wear, making them tempting to put on every single morning.",
      "2. Conversation pieces - our watches are conversation starters, designed to help you tell a story.",
      "3. Lasting lifetimes -  our watches are engineered to last and to be passed on from generation to generation.",
      "4. Designed with you in mind - our watches are designed for the wearer, eliminating common frustrations and ensuring the best possible experience.",
      "5. Make every time-telling occasion special - our watches are not just objects, they invoke emotional connections.",
      "Note that the watch in the photos is a prototype and that we are still looking to make a number of improvements on the production version that will be shipped out to backers. Let\u2019s go over what we still want to improve and what you can expect from the Zenmaster watch you will receive when we get successfully funded.",
      "With these improvements, we are confident that we will be able to provide all of our backers and future customers with a high quality watch that lives up to our standards and your expectations. We are extremely excited for you to have the final version in-hand and on-wrist. With your help we can make that happen!",
      "At pOrtahl\u00ae we are obsessed with our promise to deliver.",
      "During our last crowdfunding campaign for Peacemaker, we gave backers zero customization options. The reason was that our research showed many projects failed to deliver due to the logistics and manufacturing complexities that customization brings. After all, every variant that was ordered has to be manufactured according to order and shipped out to the right person, even if it was only one.",
      "At the same time, one of our main points of feedback on our last crowdfuning campaign was the absence of customization options. To accommodate the wish for backers to make rewards their own through customization, we went looking for a way to make that possible without shooting ourselves in the foot.",
      "Especially with the success of our last campaign, we feel more comfortable this time to experiment with customization. That's why backers can now customize their Zenmaster look with FKM rubber straps in a variety of colors. Your selected FKM rubber strap(s) can be ordered as add-ons during checkout and will ship out with your order.",
      "Just like last time; we aim to deliver your watch on time, to your doorstep, as promised.",
      "My name is Alain (on the right) and I co-founded pOrtahl\u00ae  together with Jordi (on the left). We met when Jordi became my supervisor, back when I was doing an internship at a marketing agency in 2015. We became best friends over our shared love for product design and we started working together shortly after finishing my internship. We have been talking about creating a watch together ever since we met, but we finally started working on it in 2020.",
      "In 2021 we launched our first watch, called Peacemaker, on Kickstarter and Indiegogo. It was a bigger success than we had ever imagined. 222 backers helped make our dream come true, helping us raise over $120,000 and manufacturing our first watch.",
      "We\u2019re back with our next watch: Zenmaster. It\u2019s inspired by Japanese Zen gardens, where the patterns raked in the gravel are an invitation to pause, breathe and reflect. A place for meditation and quiet reflection. That idea really stuck with us. We wanted to bring that same feeling into a watch.",
      "With Zenmaster, our goal was to build an entry-level automatic. Something accessible, but without cutting corners. It had to feel special, one-of-a-kind. Sleek enough to dress up, tough enough for daily wear. Quiet luxury that doesn\u2019t scream for attention. To us, the Zenmaster watch serves as a base for the collection that follows.",
      "And of course, it ties into what pOrtahl\u00ae  has always stood for. The deeper meaning behind our brand name is about turning that stress you often feel when checking the time into a tiny escape from the hustle and bustle of daily life, even just for a second. Allowing your mind to go through a portal into something a feeling of calm.",
      "If you're curious to see more watches like this\u2014we\u2019d love your support. Back our campaign, join the journey, and help us bring this unique watch into existence!",
      "Thank you so much for being here. Let\u2019s build Zenmaster together.",
      "Hopefully yours,",

    "company_name": "Altifarm Enverde",
    "allParagraphs": [
      "Your plant's best friend. With horticultural lighting, automated watering & smart-home integration!",
      "Light requirement of plants varies across their growth stages - germination, seedling, vegetative growth and flowering/ fruit bearing stages. It also vastly varies across plant types. Our aim was to make a universal product that could help anyone get the best growth with ease. The solution was to make multi-channel variable spectrum lights. To make it easy to operate, we devised Presets on an app.",
      "Each CURA Light incorporates a majority of full-spectrum white LEDs of a certain specification, a secondary full-spectrum white with another, along with specialized reds and blues. Each Preset is a combination of these wavelengths.",
      "Great for vegetative growth with a healthy root and stem structure, and reduces stretching.",
      "Stimulates photosynthesis and promotes biomass growth, essential for reproductive functions.",
      "There are Presets available for Herbs & Greens, Flowers & Fruits, Germination, Indoor Garden Plants and more. You could also make custom Presets for each plant and share with others.",
      "No more seasonal growing, no more pushing planters to the windows.",
      "With CURA, you could grow around the year like its spring. When provided the ideal wavelengths, plants grow up to 50% faster than being on window sills. With the right lighting and nutrition, plant stems are thicker, leaves have more mass with shorter nodes; you would also notice quicker flowering and fruition.",
      "Growing at home was never so tempting and convenient.",
      "Herbs and greens so fresh, you don't even need to rinse them. Flavors and aroma that takes you back in memories. CURA makes this happen all through the year. Harvest herbs, greens, veggies, berries, and fruits like a Pro, with surprising yields and regularity.",
      "Brighten up the low-lit corners of your home with plants.",
      "CURA by itself is elegant, understated, and appears to be levitating with less visual volume. Its mounts are discrete and suspension components are remarkable in their simplicity. With its jewelry-like leaf motifs and premium textures, CURA will start conversations anywhere.",
      "No more under watering, over watering, forgetfulness, or guesswork.",
      "Within the elegant aluminum enclosure, the CURA Pump contains a peristaltic pump that operates with high precision and low noise. It runs for a few minutes every day - schedule as set with the App - and provides drip watering through the tube to the base of the plant.",
      "Water is drawn from the reservoir, which rests beneath the planter and could suffice for weeks, to cover a vacation. Alternatively, you could draw water from a bottle or another source besides the planter. One CURA pump could service three planters in the vicinity and is daisy-chained to the CURA Light using the included short cable.",
      "\u26a1Stretch Goal \u26a1CURA Wireless Sensor (for on-demand watering)",
      "\u26a1Stretch Goal \u26a1Water Reservoir",
      "The App brings plant care to your fingertips, even while you are away from home.",
      "We're working towards making CURA truly smart. The app integrates with Apple Home-kit/Siri, Google Home, and Amazon Alexa. At this time of the product evolution, we've been able to test the basic functions such as turning on & off (by overriding the built-in timer) and controlling the RGB presets through voice commands. More to come soon...",
      "This one is for people ??\u200d\u2642\ufe0fand not for plants?.",
      "Besides the Horticulture LEDs in the middle, there's a second set of RGBW LEDs on the edge of the PCB, which can emit up to a million colors and several motion effects. Why? Because RGB colors are fun and are a great way to set the mood for the evening- there's a color for every occasion and every party. Or make it psychedelic with crazy motion effects! Again, make your own presets and share with others using the app.",
      "The RGBW LEDs are covered by a silicone diffuser with an isolator, which transmits the RGB light sideways, towards the side walls, and away from the plant.",
      "\u26a1Stretch Goal\u26a1- MusicSync function syncs the RGB lights to your beats!",
      "CURA is the first smart grow lights for the everyday plant parent.",
      "With the app with smart-home integration and preset control of wavelength, along with the ability to set watering schedule, it makes plant care convenient and fun. With low-power high-PPFD OSRAM LEDs it serves plants well while blending in with living spaces with a warm welcoming glow around your plants.",
      "CURA comes in 3 different sizes: 200mm (8'), 300mm (12')and 400mm (16').",
      "You would choose them based on the canopy spread of the plants. If in doubt, go for a bigger size. With small herbs, CURA 200/300 could cover more than one plant, if kept as a close cluster.  For big house plants, CURA 400 would do great.",
      "Plants come in all shapes and sizes. Planters, even more so.",

      "Introducing Little Sophia, Sophia the Robot's little sister",
      "Little Sophia is the little sister of Sophia and the newest member of the Hanson Robotics family. She is 14\u201d tall, and your robot friend that helps make learning STEM, coding and AI a fun and rewarding adventure for kids 8+ years old, especially girls.",
      "Little Sophia can walk, talk, sing, play games and, like her big sister, tell jokes. With Little Sophia's software, and included tutorials through Hanson's AI Academy, she is a unique programmable, educational companion for kids, inspiring children to learn through a safe, interactive, human-robot experience. Kids, educators and even Sophia the Robot fans, regardless of age, will find Little Sophia irresistible!",
      "The team behind Little Sophia is comprised of a diverse and renowned global group of engineers, scientists, roboticists, toy makers, character developers, designers and AI experts, many of whom helped build Sophia the Robot.",
      "One of our many goals at Hanson Robotics is to support and encourage the future scientists, developers, engineers and roboticists that will shape our world tomorrow.  Research has shown that science achievement gaps emerge by kindergarten and these gaps continue until at least the end of eighth grade.",
      "The growth of STEM jobs in the future is expected to skyrocket. However, there's a lack of women in these fields meaning fewer female role models, both for current female STEM employees, and for girls still forming career choices. There\u2019s no evidence that girls are less capable in these fields, but rather that they often \u2018feel\u2019 less capable, partly due to stereotyping. Stats vary by country and by discipline, but generally speaking, women make up only 15-25% of the current STEM workforce, and the gap is broadening.",
      "We believe that Little Sophia can help to introduce STEM, coding and AI to children - especially girls - in a fun, safe, inspiring and interactive way that will  make a difference in reversing the current trends.",
      "Little Sophia delivers a high-quality, entertaining and educational experience so young students are highly motivated to spend time learning with her. The interaction between Little Sophia and users focuses on storytelling and learning new things. She's not just another robot toy built by a toy company, Little Sophia has been designed and built by the same renowned scientists, roboticists and engineers who built Sophia the Robot.",
      "Little Sophia has the same endearing personality as Sophia the Robot. She is intensely curious, refreshingly innocent, and uniquely playful. She is the only consumer robot with a human-like face who can generate a wide range of human facial expressions. She not only responds to commands, but also actively engages in conversations. This unparalleled responsiveness together with her humanoid design makes Little Sophia a smart, educational companion.",

However, we are confident that our next prototype will be an exciting STEM learning kit that both children and adults can use in shallow water to experience underwater communication technology.",
      "Why Do We Care?",
      "We love learning about the ocean and how technology can make a difference. Diving is an amazing experience, but communication and safety remain huge challenges. By creating an affordable and easy-to-use solution, we hope to help scientists, emergency responders, and everyday divers communicate more effectively.",
      "Although we are just starting out, we are excited to keep improving our project and make a real impact in the world of underwater exploration!",

      "Blizwheel is a 15.6-inch e-scooter that\u2019s so compact, you can put it in your backpack or place it nicely in your desk drawer while you work.",
      "When you\u2019re not riding around, you can leave Blizwheel standing without needing to hold it. So if you need to stop by a store or use your phone while waiting for the train, you can comfortably do so.",
      "Depending on your needs, Blizwheel can be folded completely to be carried around by its handle or halfway so you can tow it around on its wheel.",
      "Safely maneuver the city with rear and front LED lights equipped with a fully functioning turn signal.",
      "Tired of walking a long way for that \"last mile\"? Blizwheel can connect you much faster to your destination, after getting off at the bus stop, metro, or a distant parking lot. It\u2019s also perfect to get around campus. Parking won\u2019t be a problem -  just fold it up and take it with you inside the classroom.",
      "Blizwheel is incredibly smooth to ride thanks to a special PU suspension which gives it the same height clearance as larger scooters and makes it easier to turn.",
      "But cutting corners isn\u2019t an option in Blizwheel\u2019s power. Its dual motors give greater speed and better acceleration. Blizwheel will become your all-around personal commute from bumpy, tight street corners to flat, open spaces.",

We are enthusiasts of innovative product development. In late 2017, our team launched Blizwheel E-Skates. Although the campaign was unsuccessful, we were able to acquire all the technologies required to develop extremely small electric vehicles. Being optimists, we didn't give up and got together again as a team in 2019. This time around, we hope Blizwheel will reach more people and encourage the use of electric vehicles.",

But because this is a new product, our supporters need to be aware that there short-term problems with mold-making and part production could lead to postponed delivery dates.",

      "In our tech-centric world, we're constantly juggling multiple smart devices. Whether we're working remotely, traveling, or just on the go, keeping everything charged up can be a hassle. Are you tired of carrying around a tangled mess of cables for all your devices?",
      "Enter Chargeasap's solution: a 100W magnetic cable that's powerful, fast, durable, and incredibly convenient. Say goodbye to cable clutter and hello to simplicity with one cable for all your charging needs!",

      "But that's not all! Connect Pro boasts a revolutionary built-in power reader, displayed on a sleek LED screen, so you can see that your devices are charging at maximum speed. It's the ideal cable for those with a busy, on-the-go lifestyle.",

Charge your iPhone at maximum speed, reducing the iPhone 14 Pro Max charging time from empty to full in just about 1 hour and 30 minutes. Overcoming Apple chip restrictions, this achievement marks a significant milestone that earlier magnetic cables couldn't achieve. We're proud to lead as the first magnetic cable capable of supporting both Apple iPhone 14 and 15 max charging speeds.",
      "You may have noticed we love incorporating screens into our products (and our customers love it too), so why not extend this feature to our magnetic cables? Connect Pro is the first magnetic cable to feature a built-in power reader showcased on a stylish LED screen. Now, you can easily monitor your device's charging progress and speed. Pretty neat, huh?",

      "We've already manufactured 200 functional samples, that are currently being distributed to major media publications, influencers and our beta testers for hands-on testing. Excited to share the reviews with you soon!",
      "Since the final mold for Connect Pro is locked in and approved, we're set to kick off production right after the live campaign wraps up\u2014or possibly even sooner.",
      "When Chargeasap develops new products, extensive research goes into finding the right manufacturing partner. For our 12th crowdfunding campaign, we've partnered with a large, experienced cable factory. Consolidating Connect Pro's production in this factory helps reduce delays common with outsourced tasks. With our background in creating high-quality mobile phone accessories and fulfilling many orders, we've gained insights from challenges in manufacturing and shipping, especially during the uncertainties of COVID-19.",
      "We're geared up for another fantastic campaign ahead! :)",
      "What sets Connect Pro apart from the competition? Well, let's dive in:",
      "With a larger power output and an LED display providing real-time battery percentage, all in a single magnetic cable.",
      "Superior features, specifications, and value for your money.",
      "Leave laptop tripping accidents in the past with our Magsafe inspired connector, ensuring a snag-free experience and peace of mind. Say goodbye to worries and start your day smoothly with our yank-safe connection.",
      "Our magnetic connection simplifies phone charging in any situation, whether you're driving, on-the-go, in a meeting, or gaming. It's user-friendly, allowing easy one-handed connections and disconnections\u2014ideal for everyone, including those with dexterity challenges. No more struggling to plug in devices, even in the dark.",
      "Ever plugged in your phone at night, only to find it dead in the morning? Connect Pro's LED light turns green when charging is successful, so you'll always know your device is connected and charging. Never worry about leaving your device uncharged again!",
      "Our cable sets feature N52 grade neodymium magnets, known as the world's strongest commercial grade magnets. These magnets are powerful enough to support up to 1.1kg (2.4lb), including devices like the iPad Pro. Trusted by over 300,000 customers since 2016, they highlight our commitment to quality and durability.",
      "Since our Infinity magnetic cable series, we've made significant upgrades, including increasing magnet thickness by 9% from 6.8mm (Infinity) to 7.4mm (Connect Pro) for a stronger magnetic connection. This enhancement is complemented by an innovative locking mechanism, ensuring a more secure connection and longer lifespan.",
      "Each cable set includes a 1.2m (3.9ft) cable and tip of your choice (USB-C, Apple (Lightning) or Micro USB), with an optional 2m (6.5ft) cable available separately, providing durability and lasting value for all your devices.",
      "Just insert the tip into your device and snap on the cable to charge!",
      "With USB cables, you often need different ones for each device, leading to tangles and compatibility issues. USB aims to be universal, so why not create a cable that truly fits that name?",
      "Our goal is one cable for all your gadgets \u2014 phones, tablets, and USB devices. It works with Apple (Lightning), Micro USB, and USB-C, perfect for headphones, Nintendo Switch, E-Cigs, GoPro, and more.

      "Our cables are built to last longer than ordinary ones, especially for iPhone users who often face durability issues.",
      "Crafted from high-quality materials like military-grade tangle-free nylon, they offer durability and reliability. Thicker cables handle higher currents for faster charging, reinforced with 4 x 3000D nylon braids for added strength.",
      "We've rigorously tested these cables with a bend test machine, subjecting them to over 15,000 bends at 180 degrees to ensure they withstand daily use. They also feature an anti-fray neck design to minimize fraying or snapping at common weak points, extending their lifespan.",
      "Magnetic cables also shield your phone port from dust and dirt. Leaving the tip in place reduces the wear and tear caused by daily insertions and removals, further preserving your phone port.",
      "Why our customers loved our Infinity cables!",
      "If you've bought our Infinity range before, we know you're wondering how and why this cable is different. Besides upgrading the tech, we've also improved its design based on the feedback we've gotten over the years, so it gives you an even better experience.",
      "Most phone manufacturers now offer their own \"fast charge technology\" with their latest devices. Check the table above to see if your device can use third-party cables for this technology. Devices with proprietary charging require their official cables for maximum speed. When using Connect Pro, the cable will still charge your device at the maximum speed possible without integrating proprietary charge technology.",
      "In order to achieve international certification for safe use, all cables are put through a number of rigorous industrial tests to ensure Connect Pro can withstand daily use.",
      "Having shipped over 300,000 orders, Chargeasap is a reputable and trusted brand in both crowdfunding and consumer electronics. All our cables come with a 15-year warranty, providing you with peace of mind for your early support.",
      "Connect Pro will be available in gunmetal and black. Each cable set includes a 1.2m (3.9ft) cable and tip of your choice (USB-C, Apple (Lightning) or Micro USB). Additional tips and cables can be purchased separately from the add-on section.",
      "If you'd like to  purchase any of the add-on items, you will be emailed a survey 14 days after the campaign finishes from BackerKit where you can:",
      "All rewards will be delivered via air freight directly from our distribution centre in Shenzhen, China. Backers are also expected to receive rewards between 4-21 days from shipping depending on the size of the delivery and your country (including USA). We've chosen this costlier method so no matter what country you're supporting from you don't have the long transportation times of sea freight.",
      "Chargeasap is a consumer electronics startup originating from Sydney with a global team who believe users should be the creators and innovators of products. We realize that your mobile phone is the one object you interact with every day more than any other object or person, so why not simplify this interaction?",
      "Our mission is to create highly innovative phone accessories that keep your devices fully charged at all times to truly keep up with your life on the go.",

      "THANK YOU to our community of loyal backers for all your support in bringing our family start up Chargeasap to life and continuing to drive our innovation.",
      "We've already invested over $100,000 toward NRE (non-recurring engineering) costs to get the prototypes up and running and cover a big chunk of the initial mold fee. To get Connect Pro off the ground, we need the support of Kickstarter backers to help fund the materials for the first production run.",

      "Safe, Simple, Urban Friendly. The game-changer for backyard or balcony beekeeping.",
      "b-box is a revolutionary hive design that completely innovates home beekeeping. With patent-pending technology that allows you to monitor your bees and harvest honey without disturbing your hive \u2013 b-box is harmony with nature at its best.",
      "Safety is a priority with b-box. Keeping bees at home means your hive is constantly surrounded by people - including children! That's why b-box has exclusive features that allow you to care for your bees without disturbing or agitating them.",
      "Our patent-pending honey harvesting system is easy to use and requires no protective clothing. Even better, no bees get squished in the harvesting process. Plus, you only have to take a small portion of honey each time \u2013 leaving enough for your bees to have some too!",
      "Tiny apartment? No garden in sight? Backyard beekeeping is no longer just for people with backyards! b-box requires less than 1 meter square of space so even those without large outdoor areas can enjoy b-box and join the home beekeeping movement.",
      "The whole family can appreciate b-box with the bee viewer! Observe and monitor your bees up close and personal with b-box.",
      "b-box is, at its core, a bee hive. We aren\u2019t pretending otherwise! But the traditional beehive we all think of today was invented over 150 years ago for professional use. It\u2019s time that home beekeeping caught up with modern technology! That\u2019s why we\u2019ve re-engineered the traditional beehive to be more people and bee friendly \u2013 not to mention better adapted for domestic use.",
      "Bee Chimney: Did you know that in nature honey bees even build their hives in rock crevices high above the ground? That was our inspiration for the bee chimney \u2013 if we could move the entrance and exit point of bees away from human level we could reduce negative interactions between keepers and their bees.",
      "Bee Viewer: In traditional hives you have to disrupt your bees to check on their health. Imagine if a giant suddenly took the roof off your house! With b-box, regularly agitating (and sometimes squishing) your bees is no longer necessary. Polycarbonate walls (the same material as shatterproof windows and eyeglass lenses) are hidden below the warm and cozy wood exterior panels of b-box, allowing you to observe your hive anytime you like! See them at work, storing honey and building honeycomb as you please. This also means you can monitor your bees\u2019 health without disturbing the hive.",
      "Patent Pending Honey Harvesting System: This may be the most revolutionary part of b-box. With the pull of a lever you can separate the honeycomb chamber from the rest of the hive. Bees will be able to exit the honeycomb chamber but not enter and the chamber empties out within a few hours. Then you can harvest your honey in a bee free environment! No protective clothing required. And, even more importantly, no bees die in the process!",
      "Modular Honeycomb: Sometimes we forget that honey is our bees' food too! That\u2019s why we developed our modular honeycomb \u2013 by taking only one of our 16 mini honeycomb frames instead of a large sheet you can control exactly what impact your honey consumption has on your hive\u2019s health.",
      "Customizable Hive: The body of b-box is a customizable hive space that allows you to organize your bees\u2019 home however you see fit. Whether you\u2019d prefer to fill it with traditional frames or give your bees some room to create their own structure just like in nature, b-box let\u2019s you do it!",
      "beeing has received recognition from a variety of prominent organizations across the globe. Volvo named beeing as one of the most environmentally conscious startups in Italy through their Taste of Volvo program. National Geographic wrote about their past projects in measuring air quality through the analysis of honey. And the Climate-KIC program supported by the European Union, invested in the development of b-box.",
      "The story of beeing started two generations ago, with Roberto's (left) grandparents. They kept bees in the Italian countryside and those traditions have been handed down. Combining that traditional knowledge with Gabriele's (right) passion for technology and innovation  \u2013 beeing was born!",
      "We are already a fixture in the beekeeping community in Italy \u2013 offering anti-theft technology for traditional hives and providing regular education opportunities and community initiatives. We even created and ran an innovative program that looked at air quality and environmental pollution in 20 different cities through the analysis of honey. We\u2019ve learned a lot from working so closely with professional beekeepers across the country and have brought this expertise to the creation of b-box.",
      "We\u2019ve been working for three years on our innovative hives and it is finally time to bring them to you! After 10 b-box prototypes and 12 months of beta testing,  b-box is now ready to bring to market. But we need your help to make it happen!",

      "This is why PIN-Master\u00ae is the Most Secure & Compact Password Manager in the world.",
      "Either passwords are easy to crack or hard to remember. To avoid hacking you must create stronger passwords which become even more difficult to remember.",
      "PIN-Master\u00ae allows you to create stronger passwords which are available when you need them. This will also give you a greater incentive to create even stronger passwords, and limit a bad habit of re-using old passwords for different services, as you never have to worry about whether you can actually remember your passwords again. This brings Security and Peace of Mind.",
      "PIN-Master\u00ae can store all your codes. You can keep all your codes in one place and have them ready by hand when you need them. PIN-Master\u00ae can store codes which consist of numbers, letters (both CAPITAL and lower cases) and other symbols and special characters, so all sorts of codes can be managed.",
      "One significant issue is password security, with weak passwords being a primary target for cybercriminals. Most hacking related breaches are due to weak or stolen passwords. Reduce the risk of hacking and potential theft of your IT identity by using strong passwords. According to the Verizon 2021 Data Breach Investigations Report, 61% of data breaches in 2020 involved credential data such as passwords.",
      "Cybersecurity is an essential consideration in our digital age, with cybercrime becoming more prevalent every year. According to a report by Cybersecurity Ventures, global cybercrime costs are expected to reach $10.5 trillion annually by 2025. In addition, the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center received over 791,790 complaints of suspected internet crime in 2020, representing an increase of almost 70% from the previous year.",
      "PIN-Master\u00ae addresses this issue by providing a secure and offline way to store and manage passwords.",
      "Today access codes are used everywhere. Whether it is PIN Codes, Passwords, User-ids, Login codes, Passport numbers or Bank accounts. And we are expected to memorize these by heart.",
      "We have deliberately made PIN-Master\u00ae \"crypto friendly\" by accommodating requirements from owners of crypto currencies, who are seeking a secure offline device where private keys and recovery phrases for their hardware wallets can be safely stored.",
      "Do you have codes which really ought not to be stored on your Mobile, in an App, in the Cloud or in any online Password Manager? And are you aware that even the most popular online Passwords Managers have been hacked? That's why we are different, we are 100% offline!",
      "You never have to worry again that your codes are stolen or that you are caught in an unpleasant situation - standing in a long queue and suddenly you cannot remember your PIN Code..... (we have all tried it).",
      "This is really like an insurance policy - you hope you never need it - but if you suddenly do - then you are pleased you signed up for it! Carry PIN-Master\u00ae as your personal security knowing that you will never be caught off guard again. Isn't this worth 20 cents per day? (Retail Price US$79 divided by 365 days - and actually it lasts for years - so the investment is much lower than 5 cents per day!).",
      "PIN-Master\u00ae 2.0 is an upgraded product which was developed after the successful Kickstarter launch of PIN-Master\u00ae 1.0 in March 2020.",

      "High-end carbon fiber bicycles are favored on the market. However, when a pure carbon frame has a cycling collision, the pure carbon frame breaks into sharp fragments, which is easy to hurt people and poses great safety risks. To solve this problem and develop materials with better performance and more safety, 3V cooperated with a team of doctors in materials from a well-known university to jointly develop and innovatively introduce aerospace and advanced military grade material - the best combination of carbon and aramid fibers.  After thousands of experiments, the world's first aramid fiber composite bicycle was created.",
      "Aramid Fiber is usually known as \u201cKevlar\u201d and is used to create body armors, bullet-proof vests, firefighters uniforms, and a world of other critical equipment that spells safety and strength for those who wear it.  Aramid Fiber is used for its excellent strength-to-weight ratio and heat-resistant properties, offering a shield of protection that is nevertheless lean and lightweight, that makes our unique e-bike exactly that: truly unique!",

      "Modern, intuitive + clean in 6-seconds. This cutting-edge design leaves other litter boxes in dust.",
      "We are sold out on Indiegogo but Boxscoop 2.0 and Curve XL are available at theboxscoop.com",
      "The litter box is a real struggle, for all of us. This system will change that but before we explain the intricacies, we would like to tell you how it came to be. From a young age I have been passionate on design, efficiency and simplicity. When I grew up I became an Engineer. Michelle and I are both passionate on fairness and respect for all creatures. The disconnect between integrating the litter box into the household and having it ethical for our cats drove us crazy.",
      "From the start of 2017 through to Oct. 2018 we stood by helplessly watching my sister face an aggressive breast cancer; I coped by spending copious amounts of time fixated on designing a better litter box. We approached it from a completely different angle demanding the utmost efficiency with zero compromise. The vision was to create the perfect synergy between human AND cat needs.",
      "James + Michelle",
      "Boxscoop has modern aesthetics and because your eyes cannot catch the corners (there are none) it appears smaller than it is. It's an illusion... it's not meant for 25 lb cats but it is bigger than a standard litter box and far more ergonomic to the way cats move.",
      "Boxscoop is chore free to maintain, raises next to zero dust, and is designed from cat behavior studies for cat comfort... plus, it's modern and looks nothing like a litter box.",
      "We released our first model in July 2018 and the feedback was incredible. We recorded every detail and consistently analyzed for improvements. Success to us is making the most number of lives better. We brought the first model to market ourselves; we can do infinitely better together with you.",
      "When dealing with pee and poo, the fewer components and seams the better. The container, scoop and cover are all precision made. Ridges and contours are elegantly carved into the surface to allow it to slice through the litter like this. The design looks simple because we over-engineered for simplicity. Creating this sized container with precision in one piece requires a machine capable of pressing the equivalent weight of 330 cars!",
      "The cover on 2.0 is designed to securely fit without any clips, because who wants to fumble with clips every time they go to clean the litter box! It's actually so secure it's essentially dog proof!",
      "5 days and 2.7 minutes total spent on the litter box, including removing/replacing the cover and tossing the waste in another room\u2014 and that's daily cleaning with a 14-15lb cat. This is real life with Boxscoop.",
      "A standard clay litter in a standard litter box with one large cat costs ~US$ 220 per year. Boxscoop is extremely litter efficient and saves hundreds in litter costs:",
      "*Annual costs calculated are approximations based on one large cat (12-15lbs). For full experiment and results, please see our blog post: The cost of cat litter",
      "From surveys, 52% of our backers use clay litter and Boxscoop is ~35% more litter efficient than a standard litter box with clay litter. From the 6000 we've shipped in 2019, that translates to at least 500,000lbs less clay litter being consumed per year. That's a big deal, and with every new Boxscoop 2.0 shipped, the number will keep increasing.",
      "We engineered features into the design to perform even better with alternative clumping litters like corn, grass, walnut, wheat and more. These litters are lighter, healthier for cats, biodegradable and they stay fresher longer, saving you money while saving the environment and your cats health.",
      "This is Boxscoop with a Walnut based litter:",
      "Grass litter compliments almost all other clumping litters, especially clay. It's typically odor and dust free and it clumps and absorbs odors and moisture amazingly well.",
      "If you have a clay litter you love, mixing 30-50% of a grass litter in with the clay will keep the litter fresher and extend its life. It also lightens heavy clays and makes them even easier to scoop!",
      "*Dr. Elsey Ultra and other similar coarse grain clay litters are sludgy and require more scooping force in Boxscoop. If you'd like to use a coarse grain clay, we highly recommend mixing in 30-50% of a grass or walnut litter.",

      "Boxscoop 2.0 is recommended for cats up to around 15lbs that are agile and can easily jump up on to a couch. The scoop can also be stored outside, or Boxscoop can be used with the cover off for cats that want a bit of extra room.",

      "In July 2018, we released the original Boxscoop. It received incredible feedback but it also could be far improved. It was our first attempt and we funded it ourselves. It was an exciting time we felt we were making a real difference! Then on October 6th, while running around chasing a feather Arthur collapsed. She was only 2.5 years old and completely had our hearts... She had a genetic heart condition called HCM and just like that little Arthur was gone... and then 15 hours later my sister took her last breaths as well.",
      "The easy thing to do would be quit Boxscoop... but this was inspired by Arthur, and encouraged by Kristy. They planted the seed and we are beyond inspired to take Boxscoop to the next level.",

      "There has to be a better way!",

      "But if you\u2019ve ever had to walk all the way back home, because you would do anything to avoid using your trackpad? Yeah, welcome to the club.",
      "That\u2019s how the idea for Magnito was born.",
      "\u201cUse of a laptop computer is associated with constrained poor postures that may contribute to discomfort in the neck, shoulder and arm. Use of an external mouse, compared to the built-in trackpad on a laptop, allows greater flexibility of arm postures with reduced work of some arm muscles. In side-by-side tests, an external mouse is more productive (speed combined with accuracy) than a trackpad. An external mouse should be one of the first steps to improving employee\u2019s daily comfort and performance while using a laptop, whether at home or in the office.\u201d",
      "- David Rempel, MD, MPH (UC Berkeley, San Francisco) and Logitech Scientific Advisory Board member.",

      "iPads, Galaxy Tab, and other tablets actually have up to 50 magnets inside of the device, which are essential for adhesion to their keyboard case and other peripherals. This is because magnetic adhesion is a commonly used technology for tablets, and it is safe for sensitive electronics.",
      "The Magnito Mouse grips onto the magnets inside your tablet, just like a keyboard case or Apple Pencil. And just like these products, Magnito\u2019s magnet won\u2019t cause damage to your tablet.",
      "For laptops too, Magnito\u2019s magnet will not cause damage to your hard drive. But, if you want to be extra safe, just place the Magnito Pad on the back of your laptop\u2019s monitor.",
      "To make sure you never lose your mouse again, our first concern was to make Magnito as adhesive as possible.",
      "That\u2019s why Magnito uses a powerful neodymium magnet, with strength verified through our strict magnetic power testing. Magnito\u2019s galvanized steel cover also maximizes the magnet\u2019s strength for even better adhesion.",

      "We, as manufacturers, came to realize just how essential mouses are when we had to carry tablets around for office work. We would also often forget to bring our mouses with us. Our productivity suffered greatly without mouses, and touchpads weren\u2019t a perfect substitute, either. That\u2019s when we came up with the idea of attaching a mouse to a tablet, similar to the Apple Pencil. We researched a proper design and structure for a magnetic detachable mouse, and found that a pebble-like design had the best grip.",
      "We then optimized Magnito\u2019s structural design for maximum adhesion, all while sporting a neat appearance. Magnito is built with a Neodymium magnet \u2013 the strongest type of magnet there is \u2013 so it can hold the mouse\u2019s weight with optimal magnetic force.",
      "We added the remote control feature in the prototype test stage. In order to preserve the mouse\u2019s aesthetics, usability, and grip, we developed a switch mode to let you use Magnito as a remote, without having to add any extra buttons.

      "Tracks 13 plant health metrics | 4 devices | Modular | In- & Outdoor | Smart Home Integrations",
      "FYTA is the first truly comprehensive plant monitoring system that works like a fitness tracker for your plants. It tracks 13 key plant health metrics and gives you everything you need to understand your plants, prevent problems, and grow confidently.",
      "How often do you find yourself staring at a wilting plant, unsure of what went wrong?",
      "Here\u2019s the truth: Even experienced plant owners struggle to keep their plants healthy because plants don\u2019t communicate their needs in a way we understand. Without real data, plant care becomes a frustrating cycle of trial and error, leading to wilted leaves, root rot, and expensive plant deaths.\n\nThis is why professional gardeners and growers don\u2019t rely solely on experience and knowledge\u2014they use plant sensing tools to ensure the best possible care for their plants.",
      "Plant Care should not feel like guesswork. This is why FYTA offers an entire suite of interconnected devices that work together to monitor your plants in real time and  ensure that your plants stay healthy.",
      "Most plant trackers are made for just one type of setup or one plant size \u2014but plants come in all shapes and sizes, grow in different conditions, and need different kinds of care. That\u2019s why FYTA is designed as a modular system. With four different trackers that work together\u2014plus interchangeable probes and different connectivity options\u2014you can customize your setup for any plant, whether indoors, outdoors, in soil, or hydroponics.",
      "The FYTA Mini and FYTA Sphere work as a team: the Mini monitors soil conditions for each plant, while the Sphere tracks the microclimate for all of them.\nThe Sphere features a reorientable dome, allowing you to adjust its angle and accurately capture direct, indirect, and diffused light from multiple directions. This flexibility makes it the perfect tool for optimizing light exposure in any environment.\n\nBoth sensors connect to the FYTA app via Bluetooth or WiFi Hub, giving you real-time insights into exactly what your plants need. If you have many plants in the same location (e.g. grow tent or window sill), this combination is the most budget-friendly option.",
      "Our all-rounders are equipped with the same sensors, but each is designed for a different environment: The Beam (Gen 2) is compact and sleek, ideal for stand-alone indoor plants. The Outdoor Beam is built for tougher conditions\u2014it features a sturdy design, a rechargeable battery, WIFI and (optionally) LTE-M connectivity, ensuring reliable operation even in remote locations. It works great in garden beds and lawns.",
      "Three years ago, we launched our first product, the FYTA Beam. Since then, we\u2019ve produced over 60,000 sensors, helping thousands of plants thrive and their owners take the guesswork out of plant care. But don\u2019t just take our word for it:",
      "Just like a high-end fitness tracker monitors your body\u2019s health beyond just steps, FYTA goes beyond simple tracking \u2014 analyzing real-time data to provide actionable insights and predictions for your plants.",
      "Our sensors adapt to any plant in any growing medium\u2014whether it\u2019s house plants, orchids, lawns, broccoli, or more, any sizes, in soil, hydroponics, or anything in between. With precise monitoring, every plant gets the care it deserves!",
      "Different plants have different root depths, making it essential to measure soil conditions at the right level to prevent overwatering and root rot. With FYTA, you can choose from probe lengths between 3 and 35 cm, ensuring precise moisture readings exactly where they matter most\u2014whether for potted plants, raised beds, or deep-rooted species.",
      "With your reward, you\u2019ll receive probes of your choice\u2014at no extra cost! This is a special perk, as our probes, which range from 3 to 35 cm in length, typically affect the pricing of our products. \u2728",
      "No need to choose your probes when placing your order! Instead, when it\u2019s time to confirm shipment, we\u2019ll send you a survey where you can select the perfect probe length for your plants.",
      "FYTA sensors connect via Bluetooth (BLE) and, with the optional WiFi Hub, can integrate seamlessly into your smart home setup. No WiFi in your garden? No problem. The FYTA Outdoor Beam connects via LTE-M at no additional cost and acts as a hub for all FYTA devices within BLE range, ensuring reliable monitoring\u2014even in remote locations.",
      "The FYTA App is your all-in-one hub for plant care, packed with detailed analysis, personalized recommendations, and expert tutorials to help your plants thrive. Easily organize your plant collection and manage to-do lists.\n\nThe FYTA App is for free and available for download now! Get started by meeting G\u00fcnther, our office plant, and explore how the system works\u2014no sensor required.",

      "When we launched our first sensor, the FYTA Beam, we didn\u2019t stop there. We continuously refined our hardware, app, and data model\u2014learning from user feedback, fine-tuning our algorithms, and iterating relentlessly to make plant care smarter and more intuitive.",
      "But we also realized that one sensor alone wasn\u2019t enough\u2014there were many use cases the Beam (Gen 1) couldn\u2019t fully cover. That\u2019s why we decided to relaunch FYTA as a complete system of sensors.",
      "In this video, you\u2019ll see one of our hardware developers, Nico, and our founder, Claudia, walk through the current state of our PCBA prototypes (EVT). To keep development efficient and cost-effective, we built all prototypes on the existing Beam form factor, allowing us to test new functions in the most cost-effective manner.Current Status of Our Development Process",
      "\u2022 The Sphere, Mini, Beam Gen 2 already moved intio tooling.",
      "\u2022 We expect to finalize the few outstanding design questions on the Outdoor Beam  shortly and move it to tooling before mid-May.",
      "\u2022 All Bills of Materials\u2014aside from the soil probe\u2014are finalized and have been thoroughly reviewed with our trusted production partner, with whom we\u2019ve been working for over four years.",
      "We aim to move all four new products into tooling and subsequent production trials by mid-May, with certification and setup costs to be covered through our regular revenue. We\u2019re committing to a tight timeline to ensure the products ship before the gardening season winds down. This will take focus, discipline, and long hours\u2014but we\u2019re not new to this. Since launching our first product on Indiegogo four years ago, supply chain management and production execution have become core strengths. On top of that, we\u2019re building on the deep experience of our long-standing, trusted manufacturing partner.",
      "This isn\u2019t just another prototype\u2014it\u2019s a product we\u2019re ready to deliver.",
      "Yes, FYTA is a venture-backed start-up with a growing customer base and steady revenue, but launching four new products at once is a major step that comes with its own challenges.\n\nCrowdfunding allows us to fine-tune our product offerings in real time\u2014helping us answer key questions like which bundles work best, which color do you prefer and what concerns or questions customers have when ordering. This information will ensure a successful launch to market.\n\nBut Indiegogo is also about building a community. Many of our earliest backers from our first campaign in 2020 remain our most loyal customers today, actively shaping FYTA\u2019s evolution. Their feedback has been invaluable in refining our app, product features, and user experience, and some have even become investors along the way.\n\nFor us, crowdfunding isn\u2019t just about launching new products\u2014it\u2019s about co-creating them together with our community and ensuring we\u2019re fully prepared for what\u2019s ahead.",
      "Algorithm Accuracy: For the past two years, we\u2019ve been dedicated to refining and enhancing our plant health algorithms. With our new sensors, we\u2019ll be able to introduce more plant health metrics, expanded app features, and support for a wider range of use cases. Some of these\u2014like lawn care\u2014are uncharted territory for us, so there may be a few bumps along the way.",
      "However, rest assured that we are fully committed to overcoming any challenges that arise. Our track record speaks for itself, and we continuously improve our technology based on real-world feedback. If you ever run into an issue, you can reach us directly through our app or Discord channel, and we\u2019ll be happy to assist you.",
      "Manufacturing: We have established a strong partnership with an experienced contract manufacturer with decades of expertise in electronic product assembly. Over the years, manufacturing and supply chain management have become one of our strengths, and our combined expertise will help ensure a smooth production process.",
      "That said, we still need to navigate the manufacturing prototyping phase, where unforeseen delays can occasionally occur. While we are launching this campaign with full confidence, we remain proactive and prepared to address any production challenges. If delays arise, we will work diligently to minimize them and keep you fully informed every step of the way.",

This advanced construction results in a bike that weighs half as much as comparable models, yet delivers the same exceptional power and speed. But it's not just about speed; the Spectrx offers a range of features designed to provide a thrilling, surf-like sensation when riding at full throttle, ensuring a dynamic and unforgettable riding experience.",

      "The rear swingarm is engineered as a single solid piece, providing the necessary strength and rigidity to handle the massive torque delivered by the powerful mid-drive motor. This thoughtful design ensures that every ride is not only fast but also smooth and reliable.",
      "At Nireeka, we are passionate about speed and consistently strive to push the boundaries. With a max speed of 50mph/80kph, the Spectrx is one of the fastest ebikes on the market.",
      "From the first ride, the Spectrx redefines what you expect from an e-bike. Its performance, innovative design, and smooth ride set a new standard. One that\u2019s hard to match and even harder to put down.",
      "The Spectrx comes in two distinct variations to suit every rider\u2019s needs. The Plus version features a 27.5x3\" rear tire and a 27.5x2.8\" front tire, striking the perfect balance between speed, control, and comfort for mixed terrain and everyday riding. Meanwhile, the Fat version boasts massive 26x4\" tires on both the front and rear, designed to dominate loose sand, snow, or rough off-road trails with superior grip and stability. Each tire setup is carefully chosen to ensure that every ride, no matter the terrain, is as exhilarating as it is reliable.",
      "Bikes that feel like a boat anchor are not fun to ride. Nireeka Spectrx is made of durable carbon fiber with a lifetime frame warranty *. This allows the bike to be almost half the weight of similar bikes with 6000W+ power.\n\n* Extended warranty offers lifetime frame warranty.",
      "Equipped with a powerful 6000W motor and 280 Nm of torque, traditional bicycle derailleurs simply can't last. Our carbon fiber chain tensioner eliminates the need for outdated derailleurs and cassettes, ensuring both durability and peace of mind, regardless of how much power you apply to the rear wheel.",
      "The eBike drivetrain set comes complete with a shifter, derailleur, chain, rear hub, and cassette. With all these essential components included, you're ready to embark on your adventure without delay.",
      "Burnouts aren\u2019t just for superbikes anymore\u2014thanks to the Nireeka Spectrx, you can leave your mark in style! With its roaring 6000W motor and instant torque, this e-bike lets you light up the tires and kick up some smoke like a pro.

      "Smart, safe, and seen from every angle.",
      "At the rear, the bike is equipped with dual taillights positioned on each side, making it visible from every angle. They include Gyro sensors that detect braking automatically, enhancing safety during sudden stops. They also act as turn signals, providing clear signals for better communication on the road.",
      "The Spectrx is in a league of its own, thanks to its monocoque carbon fiber frame. Unlike most carbon fiber frames that rely on adhesive, which not only makes them weaker in those areas but also adds extra weight, the Spectrx\u2019s one-piece design is tough as nails and light as a feather. Climbing hills or cruising through town feels like a walk in the park with this lightweight build. Plus, it soaks up bumps and vibrations like a champ, giving you a ride as smooth as butter.",
      "And here\u2019s the cherry on top: the Spectrx comes with a lifetime frame warranty*. So, whether you\u2019re hitting the open road or taking the scenic route, you\u2019ll know you\u2019re covered for the long haul.",
      "* On the extended warranty package.",

    "company_name": "Piedra Cocinar",
    "allParagraphs": [
      "One of the oldest and healthiest cooking techniques - Stone Cooking returns to our kitchens.",
      "We wanted to make one of the oldest and healthiest cooking techniques - stone cooking - accessible to everyone. So, we created a stone pan with a little modern twist so it could be used anywhere and everywhere - from the heaters to straight on the dining table.",
      "Healthy cooking. Delicious food. Long lasting. Retains heat. Eco-friendly materials. Good presentation. Even better price.",
      "These days, in this fast-paced world, we are always in such a rush. Barely ever do we take the time to ourselves. From high-speed Internet, to fast food, to high-demand everything - we are always rushing through life when we really should be slowing down and enjoying it.",
      "So we, a group of food enthusiasts, teamed up with some of the best chefs in the world to create something that would help solve this problem of rushing. Something that would be your tool in healthy eating. Something that would allow you to use an ancient cooking method at home. Something that would bring the family together. Something that would impress your guests at your next backyard barbeque party. Something that would bring out your inner Betty Crocker even if you\u2019re the worst chef in the world. And most importantly - something that would help you wind down and truly enjoy the food and company surrounding you.",
      "That something is Piedra Cocinar. A stone pan that takes us back to our roots and reminds us to slow down sometimes.",
      "Now, we know what you are thinking\u2026 What? Another cooking pan? Don\u2019t we have enough of those on the market?",
      "Well, this one is different. Isn\u2019t that what they all say, though? But seriously. This pan takes us way back to our roots. 2000 years back. And reminds us to wind down, take our time, and enjoy the moment.",
      "Inspired by Mediterranean cooking and the Mediterranean lifestyle, we believe that every person should take the time to de-stress, slow down, and truly enjoy a home-cooked meal. Whether that would be every day or just once a week - Piedra Cocinar invites you to do that by helping you cook something truly special and keeping it warm for a long time.",
      "It is well known that the Mediterranean diet is perhaps one of the healthiest diets in the world. From fighting inflammation, to reducing the risk for heart attack, stroke & Alzheimer\u2019s disease, to encouraging healthy weight loss, to improving skin health - eating like a Mediterranean has been associated with endless health benefits.",
      "Which is why we teamed up with the well-known chefs and Mediterranean food experts to bring the Piedra Cocinar project to life. Born in the small Spanish towns they continue their family cooking traditions that have been passed on generation to generation for hundreds of years. And their grandparents are living proof of the benefits of eating like a Mediterranean!",
      "Mediterranean chef Santiago  - \u2018\u2019Yes, my grandma is over one hundred years old. She is still in good health and she is a very independent lady. And she still cooks daily. And what is most important - every time we sit around the table for a family dinner, she impresses us with something new. New aroma, new taste,\u2019\u2019 he smiles. \u2018\u2019Most people in our towns can expect to live longer, much longer than the World\u2019s average\u2019\u2019.",
      "Don\u2019t get confused here. The Piedra Cocinar pan is not just another cast iron skillet or non-stick pan. It is something completely different. It\u2019s the thing you knew in the back of your head that your kitchen was missing. And once you try it, you won\u2019t know how you ever lived without it!",
      "Unlike most pans and baking dishes, Piedra Cocinar is created with gabbro diabase (black marble) rather than metal or glass. Due to the thermal mass of the rock and the material's property food is less likely to burn on it.",
      "Not to mention, for the first time in history, our Piedra Cocinar stone pans can be used anywhere and everywhere. It\u2019s stone cooking taken to another level! The only exception - microwaves. But microwaves aren\u2019t good for you anyway, so it\u2019s a win-win.",
      "Even though we would love to take all the credit, we can\u2019t. We didn\u2019t invent stone cooking - our ancestors did. All we did was make it accessible to everyone by creating a stone pan that can be used in any modern kitchen. And, we don\u2019t want to brag, but we think it\u2019s pretty awesome and our ancestors would be proud.",
      "That pretty much says it all. You know, if it was created by chefs - it has to be good.",
      "We are a team of Spanish and UK engineers, chefs, and food lovers. By combining all of our knowledge, we have designed a range of kitchenware so you could become a chef too - the Piedra Cocinar way.",
      "Even if you don\u2019t know how to cook, our team of in-house chefs creates picture-perfect food recipes weekly for you to try at home.",
      "We believe that the best things come from simplicity - fire, stone, and organic groceries. You\u2019d be surprised what a delicious and healthy combination these three components make.",
      "Not to mention, you can cook absolutely anything on Piedra Cocinar kitchenware. Unlike with barbeque grills where your possibilities are limited, food does not dry out on our stone pans. They are specially created to lock in all the healthy juices within the foods.",
      "Not only will your guests be impressed with how good of a chef you are (wink, wink), but they will also be impressed by the presentation as well.",
      "Serve the food straight from a large \u201cshare la plancha\u201d or separate \u201ca piedra para cocinar\u201d for each guest.",
      "Since the stone stays warm for a while, the food will also stay hot and moist. So you can wind down, take your time, and enjoy your meal like a true Mediterranean. No rush!",
      "It\u2019s a well-known fact that overheated or scratched non-stick pans coated by PFOA or PFTE are toxic. In fact, birds die if they inhale PFTE. Humans can survive these intoxications, but the question is - do we want to? Just because we can survive doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not harmful. Just think about it - why buy expensive, organic groceries and toss them on to Perfluorooctanoic/Teflon coated pans? It doesn\u2019t make sense.",
      "We say no to artificial coatings and want to inspire you to do so too. The Piedra Cocinar kitchenware is eco-friendly, 100% recyclable, and artificial coating-free.",
      "Made from gabbro diabase stone, hardwood handles, and lots of love, the Piedra Cocinar kitchenware is completely handmade in the UK. No slavery or kids labour involved in our production run. Just lots of passion and love for high-quality kitchenware, and a lifetime guarantee!",
      "Expect these pans to be extremely long-lasting, as they are loaded with naturally-formed layers of metamorphic stone - which is composed of silt ore, shale, and volcanic ash compressed over millions of years. Not to mention, the hardwood handles are boiled in natural oils to give longevity, strength and to revive natural beauty. The result - a beautiful, eco-friendly, one-of-a-kind stone pan.",
      "Please note this product is made from natural stone and wood, therefore you will find color and pattern variations in the stone and the wood due to the way the product is made. No two items are identical. Each and every item is unique.",
      "We like to believe that local is the new luxury nowadays. Products developed in Third-world countries can be found everywhere and are often bad quality, while handmade items are rarer and made with love.",
      "We believe that a healthy lifestyle should be accessible to everyone. Which is why our kitchenware is honestly priced. No gimmicks. No BS. Just a truly great cooking experience.",
      "In fact, believe it or not, our one-of-a-kind products handmade with love are cheaper than the ones made in developing countries. Pretty crazy, huh? We think so too.",
      "We need your help to buy more productive machinery in order to achieve even better quality products in larger quantities. This machinery, which would help us cut and assemble the Piedra Cocinar cooking stones, would allow us to reduce the prices and make our products even more affordable for everyone. Because when we say we believe everyone should be able to enjoy healthy meals on a daily basis - we mean it!",
      "Make every meal a celebration for your friends and family with Piedra Cocinar!",
      "We have spent days and late evenings perfecting the design and usability, but as usual the most significant risk, as always, is timing. \nSometimes things may go wrong that can\u2019t plan for, but we are ready to face even unplanned challenges and ensure everything within our control and within promised timescale. \nTo minimize the possibility of manufacturing setbacks and to ensure the quality meets our highest standards, we will continue to assemble Piedra Cocinar cooking stone in the UK.",

If the issue persists, or if it is something that cannot be fixed by you, we will either repair your unit without any charges, or replace it with a new one as long as the chair is not user-damaged.",

      "We offer specialized advice for History undergraduates. Help us help students reach their potential!",
      "Hi. I'm Michael Bennett from new startup History Skills UK.",
      "History Skills UK is a one-stop shop for the 40, 000 students who take History courses at UK universities and colleges every year.",
      "We have created a unique service for those students, using our many years of experience to help A Level & Undergraduate History Students in the UK succeed.",
      "Having been both tutors and students, we can help undergraduates with Study Skills, Essential Knowledge & the kind of Practical Advice they won't find anywhere else.",
      "We can also offer the best advice for those about to go to university for the first time.",
      "Your contributions can help turn this service into a major provider of help to the thousands of History undergraduates who struggle with Uni demands in their first year.",
      "You can help us help them turn things around, and ultimately be successful at university.",
      "We estimate that we need \u00a3500 to help our service get up and running.",
      "Your donations will help fund:",
      "We can offer some exciting perks to you, your families and friends!",
      "Those who donate \u00a310 or over will receive FREE Membership for 1 year - which can be used directly or passed on to those who would benefit the most from our services",
      "Those who donate \u00a325 or over will receive FREE Membership for 2 years AND half-price discounts on one-to-one advisory sessions, as well as a complimentary copy of our e-book 'How To Succeed at University' (published in 2026).",
      "If we are unable to reach our total goal, do not fear! Your perks will remain valid and we will use any monies raised to help us get off the ground.",
      "However, if you do help us to reach our goal we can take that extra step in reaching as many students as possible and becoming a major provider of their needs.",
      "Every year, thousands of History students find the step up from school to university difficult to manage.",
      "This is particularly true for working-class students, whose parents and schools are often unable to provide the kinds of support wealthier students take for granted.",
      "Many will feel their dreams of university life have turned into a nightmare and drop out.",
      "But it doesn't have to be like this!",
      "History Skills UK can provide help with basic skills that over-worked tutors have no time to provide. We have the space to deliver one-to-one advice and knowledge. And we can offer the kind of practical advice students really need.",
      "Sure, there are many expensive study guides and hard-to-read textbooks out there - a whole industry feeding off students and worried parents.",
      "By contrast, we can provide useful advice specifically tailored to the individual needs of students. And we won't charge the earth to provide that service.",
      "In most cases solutions can quickly be found to the difficulties History undergraduates face. And with a little help and the right kind of encouragement, students can find their feet and be back on track in no time at all.",
      "It just needs an experienced hand, willing to spend some time providing advice specifically tailored to the needs of the individual student.",
      "We can provide precisely that service.",
      "If you place your trust in us to deliver solutions by making a donation - however small - to our startup fund, we promise to build a service that always has the student at the heart of everything it does.",
      "Help us help History students to become the best versions of themselves. They, their parents and their tutors, will thank you for it.",
      "Our service is provided by people like myself who have gained the highest qualifications in History and taught the subject at university level.",
      "My record speaks for itself. I have studied and taught at a wide variety of institutions - from the University of St Andrews to Edge Hill and even the Open University.",
      "I received no help from parents and schools and had limited resources. I learned the hard way how to succeed at university. I also made many mistakes! I can draw on both my successes and failures to point the next crop of History students in the right direction.",
      "There are always risks with challenges like these. We are currently a small-scale organisation and we operate during a climate of uncertainty that affects universities all over the UK. We will have to be flexible and constantly plugged in to the problems faced by both students and the institutions they study at.",
      "But, as I have demonstrated time and time again, lack of resources and widespread uncertainty do not have to be a barrier to excellence.",
      "With your support, we will help students reach their potential.",
      "We know that times are tough and that some people just can't contribute. As a project seeking to help those students who have few resources, we understand that very well.",
      "However, that doesn't mean you can't help us grow in other ways!",
      "Please get the word out! Share this campaign on your socials and amongst your contacts.",
      "Every single penny raised will help us help students reach their potential. Even the smallest donation will genuinely help.",

    "allParagraphs": [
      "soilkind is a fully automatic kitchen composter which unites natural composting & unique technology",
      "Important information: When we started our crowdfunding campaign here, our kitchen composter was called KALEA. A lot has happened since then, we've perfected our prototype and entered into a fantastic production partnership with a great company.",
      "We've grown. And so our name has continued to evolve. Since December 2022, KALEA is called soilkind.",
      "soilkind turns your organic waste into nutrient-rich compost. In only 48 hours.",
      "Technology has made its way into every aspect of our daily life, but nobody really pays attention to the way we treat food scraps at home. Many households have no solution to dispose of food scraps in a convenient, clean, and sustainable way. This is also a global problem since organic waste accounts for up to 50% of the overall waste volume. Nature gave us the inspiration we needed to solve this problem. soilkind unites the natural composting process with smart technology to transform organic waste into nutrition-rich compost. We say: Don\u2019t waste your waste!",
      "If you experience any of these situations, you definitely need to upgrade your kitchen routine:",
      "What\u2019s on your chopping boards and plates? Share the leftovers with soilkind. It can handle any kind of organic waste.",
      "We knew there had to be a better solution. We wanted to create a smart device that was just as good as a compost pile, but faster, more comfortable to use, hygienic, and without any unpleasant odors. More than two years of research and testing led us to the perfect solution with our unique and patent-pending technology.",
      "We are the only ones who offer a complete solution. Other products promise to create \u201cfertilizer\u201d - but they really only just dry and grind up waste with no biological decomposition. This output can grow mold, is not nutritious to plants, and can actually be harmful. That\u2019s why only soilkind compost is king!",
      "There is no compost fairy. soilkind impresses with its own magic: an innovative, fully automatic technology with lots of sensors inside. Three simple steps and 48 hours is all it takes for your organic waste to turn into real nourishing compost.",
      "Step 1: Fill soilkind with your food scraps. Are you a real foodie? No worries, soilkind is designed to handle the weekly organic waste volume of a typical four-person family (appx. 2 cycles of 10 liters). Our robust shredding system processes and dries almost everything, even nutshells, and small bones!",
      "As a nice side effect, this leads to a volume reduction of 85%. When enough material accumulates, soilkind automatically processes it to the composting chamber. No odors or fruit flies \u2014 just your excitement for fresh compost.",
      "Step 2: The composting chamber of soilkind is full of sensors and has an intelligent control system. A perfect combination of temperature, humidity, and aeration wakes up the natural microorganisms inside the organic material and turns it into a land of milk and honey that accelerates the microorganisms\u2019 metabolism. soilkind substantially reduces composting time from several months to just 48 hours.",
      "Step 3: The result? Ready-to-use compost for all your plants and flowers \u2014 indoor and outdoor. Your plants will love it since only compost contains such a full spectrum of essential plant nutrients. And if you don\u2019t need all your compost at once, no worries, your soilkind compost can be stored for up to two years.",
      "Plants are living beings, and like us, they need nutrients to grow and stay healthy. So treating them with compost should be on your regular plant routine list. But be careful. In some cases, using dried organic waste (often referred to as \"fertilizer\") can also cause mold and inhibit plant growth. And no plant parent wants this. Right? soilkind compost is so rich in nutrients that it can be mixed in a 1:10 ratio. This means 1 part of soilkind compost with 10 parts of soil.",
      "Garden compost is the most natural way to dispose of organic waste. If managed carefully, it leads to already matured compost. However, this takes a whole lot of time and especially cooked food shouldn't be treated this way since it attracts vermin.",
      "soilkind transforms the majority of compounds in your food scraps like sugar, starch, and proteins. These are broken down within 48h to fresh compost. If mixed with earth, fresh compost gives an immediate boost to your plants and realizes its nutritional potential.",
      "Food waste dryers do only one thing: shredding and drying food. There is no biological decomposition process involved. The organic compounds in this waste are thus inaccessible to plants.",
      "STEP 1: REMINERALIZATION",
      "Your organic waste is a bit like a fresh and full shopping bag. In order for your plants to use the nutrients, the \"bag\" must first be unpacked. This unpacking is called remineralization.",
      "During the remineralization process, organic molecules are converted into inorganic minerals. This conversion is done by omnipresent microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi, which are a natural part of our food.",
      "STEP 2: COMPOSTING",
      "During composting, the main components of organic waste (sugars, starch, proteins, fats, and at a later stage, cellulose) are broken down.",
      "The compost quality and the conversion time can be influenced by providing optimal metabolic conditions for the microorganisms over a certain period of time. These conditions include temperature, pH value, moisture, amount of oxygen, and surface area. The better the conditions are met, the faster high-quality compost is achieved.",
      "Combining the latest technology with the superpowers of natural microorganisms - that\u2019s the essence of soilkind. All of this happens inside our fully automatic kitchen composter in only 48 hours.",
      "Did you know that incorrectly disposed organic waste is not only a wasted resource but is also more dangerous for the climate than CO2?",
      "When organic waste is dumped in a landfill, it undergoes anaerobic decomposition (because of the lack of oxygen) and generates methane gas. Methane gas is a potent greenhouse gas \u2014 about 28 times more harmful than carbon dioxide at warming the earth, on a 100-year timescale, and more than 80 times more powerful over 20 years.",
      "Due to a lack of convenient and clean waste disposal techniques, a significant amount of organic waste is sent to landfills - even in the most developed countries.",
      "This is one of the main reasons why we want to revolutionize your daily organic waste routine.",
      "Bogs represent an important \u201ccarbon sink\u201d \u2013 a place where CO2 is stored below ground and can't escape into the atmosphere and increase global warming. They only cover 3 % of the earth's surface but store about 30% of global CO2. One hectare of the bog with a 15-centimeter thick peat layer contains about as much carbon as a hundred-year-old forest in the same area. That\u2019s amazing! But bogs are in danger. In many places, they are extracted to produce peat, which is then used to enrich potting soil. The protection of bogs is an incredibly important part of climate protection, that is very close to our hearts at soilkind. Therefore we chose to support an NGO which is committed to the protection of bogs. Also, your homemade compost leads to bog protection. With soilkind you can always use peat-free soil because our compost airs the soil and provides it with enough nutrients. The mixing ratio is 1 to 10. 1 part soilkind compost and 10 parts peat-free potting soil.",
      "Give your indoor plants a green booster or nourish your veggies outside. There are so many ways to spread some compost love.",
      "soilkind was founded in 2017. Since day one, our mission has been to create a long-lasting product that combines our digital lifestyle with design and sustainability. Many steps have been mastered during this time including several prototypes, endless compost testing, and cooperation with leading research institutes.",
      "After many tests and trials, the 4th generation prototype was created. Here is an unedited glimpse of the magic behind the machine:",
      "A smart home that feels completely natural \u2013 that\u2019s the challenge of digital devices today. We have created soilkind's design to integrate our kitchen composter stylishly and organically into everyday kitchen routines. Puristic, beautiful, practical, and easy to use.",
      "soilkind is as unique as your food scraps. Keep everything in focus and learn more:",
      "We have been working towards this day for more than two years. Now that we have a fully functional prototype that completely meets our requirements, we are on our way to start serial production. With your help, we can save the world from incorrectly disposed organic waste by giving every household the power to create its own compost.",
      "BY NOW WE HAVE:",
      "WITH YOUR HELP WE WILL:",
      "We are a passionate team of material scientists, engineers, and hobby gardeners located in Stuttgart, Germany. Our mission is to develop innovative solutions that increase the convenience of handling food waste at home while improving sustainability.",

      "Minimalist outside. Over-engineered inside. Built to brew clean, balanced, and consistent coffee.",
      "The dripper project began three years ago with an ambitious goal: to design the world\u2019s first flat-bottom dripper that merges fluid dynamics, design principles, and mechanical engineering.",
      "The end result \u2014 aesthetically simple, mechanically over-engineered, and experientially optimized to bring out unrealized flavour notes from coffee.",
      "We are a research studio focused on documenting ordinary moments.",
      "We believe the intentional act of brewing pour-over coffee is a meaningful daily reminder to make space and savour ordinary moments. From selecting lightly roasted beans, smelling them as you open the bag, making mental connections to the flavour notes on the packaging, imagining how fine or coarse to grind, to taking that first sip, each step invites presence.",
      "Within this process, we noticed that the dripper is the object that ends up being the most visually prominent, the one we look at the longest. This observation led us to a new design philosophy around what a dripper should be, and what it can become.",
      "So, we designed a dripper that remains quietly in the background and unobtrusive instead of trying to be the main character. We want users to focus on the aroma of the coffee, the sound of water pouring over the coffee bed, and the flow of the brewing ritual that leads to that first sip.",
      "Aesthetically simple, mechanically over-engineered, and experientially optimized to bring out unrealized flavor notes \u2014 these qualities are the byproduct of our serendipitous encounter with a product design studio called over_engineered.",
      "Three years ago, during the research phase of this project, we had both qualitative and quantitative data on what makes a good flat-bottom dripper \u2014 yet we struggled to translate that data into a tangible product. After going through our V1 and V2 prototypes, we hit a wall due to conflicting design philosophies and manufacturing complications. Thanks to our new partner, over_engineered, we were finally able to define and visualize what \u201cjust enough\u201d looks like for our dripper \u2014 grounded in research, and made real through design.",
      "Our Yeoyu Dripper is made of 304 stainless steel for sustainability, features an airtight double wall for thermal mass, an optimized diameter for aroma, and a sandblasted finish for a smooth yet matte tactile experience.",
      "We look at innovation in two different ways. One approach is to create something entirely new that has never existed before. The other is to improve an existing product and create a subsegment within a mature category.",
      "We chose the latter. Together with the over_engineered team, we developed a new interchangeable puck system that minimizes clogging and distributes extracted coffee through multiple channels, resulting in a \u2018just right\u2019 flow rate. Our focus on the post-percolation process, pushing extracted coffee through a puck, opened up new possibilities for flavor articulation.",
      "During our usability research phase, we found that we needed three specific components to further improve the user experience of our coffee dripper: a silicone gasket to hold the puck in a snug fit, a silicone bottom pad to protect the carafe from direct contact with stainless steel, and a polycarbonate saucer to ensure a global fit with most carafes on the market.",
      "Throughout our research, we tested different types of flat-bottom paper filters. We designed the dripper to be compatible with the Kalita Wave 185 filter, SIBARIST flat filter, April filter, and Origami Wave filter.",
      "While it was designed in Vancouver, the idea was dreamt in Seoul, encouraged in Berlin, inspired in Kyoto, and confirmed in Copenhagen.",
      "Together with Yeoyu and the over_engineered team, we are Canadians living in a beautiful city called Vancouver, with roots that trace back to South Korea, Japan, and China. It was important for us to acknowledge that and reflect it in our dripper, a reminder that good design is a shared language. For us, it\u2019s more than just a dripper.",
      "It takes a village to bring something from zero to one. I\u2019m sure many folks we came across throughout this product research and development journey might not know how helpful it was to hear a word of encouragement and genuine feedback. Hoping more folks know how much we are grateful for their help, here is the list of people we\u2019re thankful for and their contributions.",

      "Bringing Firefly to life has been a journey filled with innovation, iteration, and real-world problem-solving. From early prototypes to near-final production-ready models, our team tackled major engineering challenges to ensure a reliable, lightweight, and scalable product.",
      "In the early stages, we used AWG28 wires to connect the electronic components inside Firefly. This required manual soldering, which introduced a significant failure rate \u2014 nearly 50% of the prototypes showed glitches or poor connections. The wires would often come loose, and the folding mechanism added mechanical stress that made the system unreliable.\nTo solve this, we redesigned the internal structure to eliminate vulnerable wiring connections while preserving a stable and compact energy system.",
      "Firefly was designed with a folding feature to allow for compact packaging. Initial prototypes used miniature hinges with screws and nuts, which caused several assembly issues: poor screwing, broken plastic parts, and frequent nut loss. This approach was not scalable for mass production.\nWe overcame this by designing a custom plastic-injected hinge, completely removing the need for screws and dramatically improving the product's manufacturability and reliability.",
      "As we transitioned from prototype to production-ready, one of the toughest challenges we faced was scalability. What worked well in a handmade, one-off prototype didn\u2019t always translate smoothly to an efficient, repeatable process on a larger scale. Small imperfections, like minor asymmetries in 3D-printed parts or subtle misalignments during manual assembly, revealed just how sensitive the design was to production variables.",
      "To prepare Firefly for mass manufacturing, we had to redesign several internal components, simplify the assembly flow, and reduce the number of manual steps. We also invested in custom tooling and collaborated closely with manufacturers to ensure that tolerances, materials, and assembly logistics were feasible at volume \u2014 all without compromising the original concept or user experience.",
      "In short, making a product that works once is hard. Making one that works thousands of times, reliably and affordably, is a whole different challenge \u2014 but one we\u2019re proud to have tackled head-on.",
      "Firefly integrates a wide range of technical disciplines, each of which required dedicated development cycles. After five full iterations, we achieved the current design \u2014 a balanced blend of functionality, safety, and manufacturability.",
      "Our goal was to design an intuitive signaling system that required no external remote \u2014 just the user's natural head movement. This had to be simple enough for a child to understand and use, yet advanced enough to be trusted by any commuter.\nKey electronic components include:",
      "Each of these components was chosen to support a reliable, hands-free experience, keeping the rider's attention where it belongs \u2014 on the road.",
      "The development of Firefly\u2019s housing was one of the most intensive parts of the process. We needed the shell to be lightweight, aerodynamic, shock-absorbing, recyclable, and suitable for mass production.\nAfter extensive material testing, we selected:",
      "The housing geometry was refined to accommodate helmet curvature, maintain user comfort, and enclose all electronics in a protected, hollow internal structure. Every curve, thickness, and junction was considered to balance strength and usability.",
      "Though Firefly is mounted at the back of a helmet, it plays a crucial aerodynamic role. The device wraps partially around the helmet to enable 180\u00ba visibility, so its shape had to be engineered to minimize drag and avoid disrupting balance.\nAdditionally, the surface geometry was developed to prevent water accumulation, which could otherwise compromise electronic performance.\nAs a final design decision, we chose to split the side \u201cwings\u201d of Firefly for manufacturing and assembly efficiency. This decision, however, brought renewed attention to water-repellency \u2014 addressed through the selection of specialized plastics in those exposed areas.",
      "After extensive prototyping, testing, and refinement, Firefly is ready \u2014 but to move from a working prototype to full-scale production, we need your help. Your support will allow us to kickstart manufacturing, invest in production tooling, secure high-quality materials, and meet minimum order quantities. By backing this campaign, you\u2019re not just pre-ordering a product \u2014 you\u2019re helping us bring Firefly to life and make urban mobility safer for everyone.",
      "We stand by the quality and reliability of Firefly. That\u2019s why every unit comes with a 2-year limited warranty from the date of delivery.\n\nThis warranty covers:",
      "What\u2019s not covered:",

      "... our most sharp and durable Damascus knife series we have ever made.",
      "Germanicum Arminius is the result of hundreds of hours in refinement of Damascus forging techniques, refinement of production technologies and design improvements on every level.",
      "Our team of dedicated engineers, black smiths and designers put all their passion into this new series of Damascus knives and today we are proud to share these beautiful new knives with you.",
      "Sternsteiger started its own production of Damascus knives back in 2015 and the companies passion for tradition and technology since then has driven the company to new innovations.",
      "Our engineers did not limit themselves to Damascus knives and brought beautiful knives like the popular Sternsteiger Titanium and Achilles Series to market. These endeavors not only helped us to understand the needs of our customers, but also provided us with the experience to improve on our original classic Damascus knife design.",
      "In case you are interested to learn more about the development process of Germanicum Arminius scroll down to the development section, but let us focus for now on what we have improved based upon our original VG10 series below.",
      "We completely re-engineered the finger-guard and bolster tip section of the knife in order to shorten the distance between handle and blade. This much more compact design results into a higher degree of control over the blade.",
      "For more pressure point and grip, a new added Bolster has been added below.",
      "The new bolster is made of the same Damascus steel and is held in place with two brass pins that are polished in a way that they optically merge with the steel.",
      "The new blade is overall more straight than the old design. On the picture below you can see how the old blade falls off towards the edge, while our new blade offers an almost straight surface.",
      "The tapered shape of the old blade makes the knife very stable, but also inflexible. The new flatter shape gives the blade more flexibility and thanks to the new steel we don't lose anything in terms of durability.",
      "In addition the new blade has been straightened with a slightly more curved belly while adding some width in the middle of the blade, providing a greater surface area for improved cuts.",
      "The biggest difference between the two series is the steel which now consists of 440 instead of 67 layers of steel. This increased amount of steel layers gives the blade much more rigidity and therefore increases the durability and lifetime of the blade.",
      "In addition the blade itself becomes a piece of art. Our black smiths have become very creative in regards to possible patterns that can be forged into the blade and therefore making each blade a unique master piece.",
      "The prominient but important feature is this handle, its made up of pure wallnut wood, as compared to our VG-10 series, which has an Micarta handle.",
      "The handle is finished by a pure Damascus cap which compared to the basic stainless steel cap from the VG-10 series gives these knives an even better look and durability.",
      "The old VG-10 series had an Oval shaped bigger Cap, where as the new Arminius series has an Egg shaped oval Damascus forged cap with a pin.",
      "The handle diameter has been trimmed making the Arminius handle thinner -tubular and easier to hold even for smaller hands.",
      "The same applies to the new handle cap as explained above.",
      "The Arminius series has different blade serrations for cutting bread.",
      "Even the Tip of the Arminius bread knife has been changed below ( continous form) below.",
      "The handle features the same updated characteristics like the brass pins and the red leather ring inlays with an added U sahped or V shaped forged Bolster below.",
      "The exciting striking feature of the new Arminius Series is its completely hand-made forging production as compared to the mechnical industrial production of our old VG-10 series.",
      "Since the carbon content is more in the Arminius series, its non stainless steel and have an increased tendency to oxidation process, which is a standard normal behaviour of all original historical hand forged damascus forge.",
      "Arminius Series is an inspired historical handmade forging process as compared to our old VG-10 series which is actually done via closed die forging or impression die forging. Our bladesmiths have used same old age forging methods to have this unique series for you.",
      "Damascus Steel & great warriors in history.",
      "It is been said that the great ancient warriors loved the damascus weaponary originated from the city of Damascus ( modern day Syria ). In those days, the damascus forgeing steel was forged with bringing the steel into a wootz form.",
      "Our team has been trying to forge a knife that has the unique combination of finest elements of steel & wood. For this reason, we included the 440 layers of damascus & the wallnut wooden handles for Arminius damascus Series.",
      "This unique damascus knife series will be presented in two damascus design patterns",
      "A- Raindrop damascus Pattern",

      "Solid wood pieces, wooden board and the most advanced features from the chess world.",
      "If you love chess, you enjoy the little details of a well-crafted physical set, like the beautiful weighted pieces and natural wood details.",
      "Online chess is definitely convenient and offers possibilities that a physical board just can't. However, playing on a screen will never give you the same experience, and it completely diminishes the beauty of the game.",
      "We bring you the best of both worlds: the infinite possibilities of online chess and the enriching experience of a physical set.",
      "Introducing Phantom. The most advanced chess board in the world.",
      "Phantom is elegantly crafted in natural wood, with the attention to detail chess deserves. But what really makes it extraordinary is inside.",
      "To make the best autonomous chess set in the world, we created a sophisticated sensor array that detects the precise location of every piece and a fast, silent mechanism that moves the pieces smoothly across the board, like magic, for the most amazing chess experience you will ever have.",
      "Phantom allows you to enjoy a real, physical chess game against anyone, anywhere.",
      "Whether it is someone on the other side of the world or a friend or family member you haven\u2019t been able to see for a year, Phantom brings you together.",
      "When you play against someone online, their moves happen in real-time on your board as if they were in the same room. And they don't even need to have a Phantom. They can play with you using their smartphone or computer, but if they use their own Phantom board, the experience becomes magical, as your moves reflect in their board in real time, too.",
      "Direct your troops in battle with fast, responsive voice commands. Like coming out of a magic story, the pieces move autonomously as if enchanted. Marvel anyone by playing a hands-free chess game.",
      "Computers have brought new life to the ancient game of chess. It was once thought impossible that a machine would be able to beat a Grand Master human player. But now, computers have become so good that trying to compete against them is a futile endeavor.",
      "Phantom allows you to play against Maia, a human-like neural network chess engine, specifically designed to mimic human play. It automatically adapts to your rank and always presents you the most challenging and enjoyable game.",
      "Of course, you can also play against other popular engines like Stockfish at different levels and even integrate your own.",
      "Perfect your skills with the Phantom Tutor: your personal trainer. It remembers your every move and gives you precise recommendations on how to improve.",
      "Streaming the Brandenburg Concertos on your phone will never be as exciting as watching the orchestra perform them live. The same is true with chess.",
      "Master games deserve to be enjoyed over and over again.",
      "In Sculpture Mode, Phantom plays back the most iconic games in history autonomously. Choose one from our curated library of 100+ games or upload your own. You can also record your own games and entertain your guests by replaying your greatest matches.",
      "Chess is not just a board game to be put away when you\u2019re done. Chess is art and should be treated as such.",
      "We designed the Phantom set to be the focal point of any room. Phantom is an elegant, timeless collectors' piece that honors the beauty of the game and immediately grabs the attention of anyone who passes by.",
      "Built with high-quality materials and attention to the very last detail, Phantom is a mesmerizing kinetic sculpture to contemplate for hours and proudly display your passion for chess.",
      "We designed Phantom to be enjoyed by novices and professionals alike. Phantom is the perfect gift for any chess lover at any skill level.",
      "THE MINIMAL",
      "Designed to preserve the essence of classic and timeless chess with a modern twist.",
      "The pieces have a minimalist expression yet are easily recognizable.",
      "Ideal to complement any modern space",
      "THE CLASSICAL",
      "Without a doubt, the most recognizable style, the Staunton chess set has been loved for over 150 years. We didn\u2019t want to miss the opportunity to bring this traditional design into the 21st century.",
      "It is ideal to complement any home library, private study, or office.",
      "Expert players are renowned for their graceful moves. Precise. Without hesitations.",
      "But so far, automatic boards have failed to imitate this, they have slow and robotic moves like claw machines.",
      "We wanted to recover the human touch and mimic real movements as much as possible to provide the most enjoyable automated chess experience.",
      "Phantom's beautiful pieces glide flawlessly over the board. And while you won\u2019t be able to play blitz with it, the moves are fast and precise. It feels natural as if you are playing with another person.",
      "Through obsessive attention to detail, we custom-built every aspect of our chess board and pieces to feel like the most authentic set you have ever owned.",
      "The natural wooden board brings a timeless aesthetic. The chessmen are weighted and precisely balanced. We carefully curated the right material for the base of each piece, one that provides low friction for smooth autonomous motion, but doesn\u2019t change the feeling of playing chess.",
      "An autonomous board posed a unique design challenge. Because all the pieces must be able to travel between any other two, typical wide-base chess piece design would mean tiny pieces like those from a dollar store.",
      "We solved the problem and designed chess pieces that look and feel premium without being too bulky for the digitally enabled wooden board.",
      "Phantom brings you an unparalleled experience. Pieces moving naturally and gracefully. The whisper-quiet mechanism lets you enjoy the game without distractions.",
      "The Cordless Phantom version allows you to enjoy a great chess game wherever you are.",
      "Relax playing in your backyard on a sunny afternoon. Show off your autonomous board at the center of the room without any cumbersome cables. With its long-lasting battery, The Cordless Phantom makes the possibilities endless.",
      "We want to enable a deeper enjoyment of chess by allowing anyone to communicate with the Phantom Board using our Open Source Protocol. This means that anyone who wants to support our board will be able to do so. Tinkerers and hobbyists can use the board as a platform for any project they can imagine.",
      "We have been sharing the development of this project in our Hackaday.io post. We want to share every detail of the Phantom Chess so it is not only Open-Source, but also Open Hardware.",

      "We love chess.",
      "We believe chess holds significance for all humanity. Chess is art, history, science, creativity, passion, and so much more. So we set out to turn chess into a sculpture that pays homage to its legacy, while building a functional board that provides an exceptional experience.",
      "We are a team of experienced engineers and product designers with a huge passion for building robots, and we have dedicated the past 18 months to Phantom.",
      "It has taken a lot of mechanical and electronic engineering to create a system that moves flawlessly with uttermost precision and runs for years without issues. We\u2019ve invested hours testing our mechanisms and reviewing every last detail.",
      "The magic of Phantom is hard to describe and must be experienced to be understood. We want you to forget there is a robot inside the board, so we tweaked everything to be invisible to the point where you can just simply enjoy it. We ran already a beta-testing stage, where our first backers give us great feedback to help us define the last details of our board.",
      "The pieces needed to effortlessly glide across the board without touching each other. This required a meticulous design process and significant iteration until we reached such precision.",
      "Our goal was to create a piece of high engineering that embodies the perfection and beauty of chess, so high-quality materials and assembly methods were top priorities. We collaborated closely with wood suppliers for the pieces and the boards to create countless prototypes until we got it just right.",
      "After more than a year of hard work,  the Phantom board is fully developed and in final production prototyping phase. Our boards are completely integrated and we are currently working on improving the last aesthetic and functionality details to make it even better.",
      "Fully working prototype playing online",
      "Fully working prototype playing against AI",

      "If you want to learn more about our process and see every step of Phantom's development, check out our Hackaday page and follow us on Instagram.",
      "We moved forward, and the first units have reached our backers. We are delighted with their feedback, and after some adjustments, we are manufacturing at full speed. The current expectation is to complete all the IndieGoGo orders by the end of May. Here you can find some reviews:",
      "We\u2019ve already begun shipping Phantom boards to our backers and are deep into the fulfillment phase. With production running steadily and new batches going out each week, we expect to complete delivery of all Kickstarter and Indiegogo pre-orders by the end of July. Your support is helping bring Phantom to life\u2014thank you for joining us on the final stretch!",
      "Shipping will be charged on our Pledge Manager closer to the date of shipping. Shipping rates are very volatile right now, so we cannot provide an exact price.",
      "Currently, depending on the country, we calculate the shipping rates between $60-$125. We are working on getting the best deal for the shipping process to offer you the best rate and fastest delivery times.",
      "Are there taxes, duties, and VAT?",
      "Our price does not include any kind of fee imposed by your country. Those are regulated by the laws of each individual country, but we will do our best to minimize the additional cost.",
      "We have worked in the product development industry for more than a decade, and we have built strong relationships and systems to manage complex products.",
      "We are taking the following steps to minimize the most common issues IndieGoGo campaigns face:",
      "First of all, we are working with established suppliers. We have previously worked with our manufacturers and have created positive relationships with them. We have been developing and prototyping Phantom with their feedback since the beginning to ensure it is manufacturable and scalable.",
      "Secondly, we have set our timeline carefully. Many campaigns are over-optimistic, so when the time comes, they can\u2019t deliver in the promised timeline. We have taken the necessary steps to create a solid timeline and provide enough room to do everything we need to make sure we deliver an outstanding product.",
      "And lastly, communication is the most important thing between creators and backers. That\u2019s why we will post regular updates so you can see exactly what is happening in Phantom's development. In the event that something goes wrong, we will always keep you updated with both the reason for the issues and what steps are we taking to solve them.",
      "We look forward to partnering with you to bring Phantom to the world!",
      "This project collocates surveys by PledgeBox, the Pledge Management system helped thousands of creators to be more successful with more sales and satisfied millions of backers.",

Just 30 seconds to go from a beach lounger to a backpack with a lot of cool features, a real portable all-in-one solution for outdoor lovers, couples, and families to relax.",
      "We all faced it: enjoying outdoor life could be stressful. Wild beautiful free beaches don't usually offer facilities and your nearby city parks don't have places to lay down comfortably. So you'll find yourself carrying many bags and a lot of things like sun umbrellas, chairs, towels and more.",
      "We present the first convertible solution designed to make you fully appreciate the contact with nature during your excursions to the sea, lake, park, or countryside. BeachBack can hold everything you need for a day trip. At the right time, it can be transformed into a practical sunbed in just 30 seconds. So, you can relax without compromise and without depending on expensive tourist facilities.",
      "Imagine all the things you need for a day at the beach: chair, umbrella, towel, and a bag (at least one) filled with everything you need, like sunscreen, books, tablet computer, toys, and maybe even a cooler with fresh water, snacks, etc. Carrying all this stuff with you could be impractical and uncomfortable, but it\u2019s all incredibly simple with BeachBack.",
      "In sunbed mode, BeachBack offers a complete solution with a headrest, sun canopy and extendable awning, wind-resistant towel, and a wide range of pockets and compartments, including an insulated pocket, and a pocket for a solar power bank.",

      "BeachBack is also a very practical 35 liters backpack, designed to be comfortable: the padded shoulder straps and the weight distribution belts make it easy to load it on your shoulders or take it by hand as a duffle bag.",
      "The high capacity allows you to bring everything you need for a day of leisure and organize it at best thanks to its various functional pockets. It's fair to say that BeachBack is an actual, proper, backpack, not just a beach chair with shoulder straps.",

This means both U.S. Standard Full-sheet  (1220mm x 2440mm), as well as European Standard Full-sheet (1250mm x 2500mm), can work directly with Spider S1, reducing material waste and making the process more efficient!",

Building on the experience from those projects and continuous product innovation, along with user feedback, Tyvok has been pushing the boundaries of laser engravers, exploring new possibilities. This time, we've truly expanded those boundaries!",

      "No need for pre-cutting or preparation. From now on, you can start working directly with whole boards! The Spider S1's unique front-opening design allows you to easily slide entire boards in from the front. This not only saves you time but also maximizes material usage and minimizes waste.",

      "S1 is also equipped with a safety lock. If the top cover is opened suddenly during operation, the machine will automatically stop to minimize laser and smoke exposure. However, if you need to monitor the progress at any time, you can disable the safety lock in the machine settings.",
      "Unlike traditional machines that struggle with smoke and noise, the Spider S1\u2019s automatic fire control and efficient exhaust system keep your workspace clean and secure.",
      "Specific projects can generate significant smoke and dust, impacting your experience and work quality. The Spider S1 addresses this with an integrated smoke fire extinguishing system that automatically manages fires or high temperatures, ensuring safe operation. With the built-in mini fire extinguisher, user and product safety is ensured even in the event of an unexpected flame.",
      "With the advanced thermal aerosol technology, each unit effectively protects a 0.5 cubic meter area, and with two units, a 1 cubic meter space is fully safeguarded, providing comprehensive coverage for the entire enclosed area.",
      "Since the primary fire risk is located near the X-axis laser head, deploying mini fire suppression units at both ends of the X-axis is generally recommended.",
      "The 60W semiconductor laser equipped on the Spider S1 is powerful enough for your most ambitious ideas.",
      "The laser head is equipped with an automatic frequency reduction feature, allowing the power to be adjusted from 60W down to 40W and 20W. This reduction in power not only minimizes the spot size for more precise engraving on different materials but also extends the laser's lifespan.",
      "With its high-power 60W laser, the Spider S1 dramatically improves work efficiency. The increased power enables quicker engraving and cutting, allowing you to complete projects faster.",
      "Spider S1 has undergone extensive testing on various materials, thicknesses, and power settings. Here, we can showcase some of these tests across different materials to help users easily set the optimal parameters during use. This provides users with a reference for achieving the best performance and precision.",
      "The laser fan automatically starts and stops, making work safer, quieter, and smarter.",
      "Built-in Air Assist Duct: The system features a built-in air assist duct, eliminating the need for an external air assist setup. This integrated design results in greater precision and a more streamlined appearance.",
      "Not only laser, the Spider S1 also excels in high-precision CNC cutting based on LightBurn.",
      "Equipped with its 2nd-gen Artist Precision Module, you can easily create stunning reliefs and dive into woodworking with a minimal learning curve.",
      "The CNC module based on LightBurn is a module that reads the laser PWM protocol and maps the grayscale values to the set depth values. It allows laser engraver users to compile toolpaths in LightBurn through simple settings, enabling basic CNC cutting tasks.",
      "With the Spider S1, all you need is easy-to-use laser engraving software to perform both relief engraving and cutting. No specialized CNC knowledge is required, the module can be easily operated through LightBurn and LaserGRBL.",
      "Thanks to its self-developed rack and gear coupling system, Spider S1 effectively reduces errors even when the work area is expanded, ensuring perfect results for large-format engraving and complex cuts. The Spider S1 consistently retains its accuracy, allowing seamless upgrades and expansions without sacrificing performance.",
      "While the Spider S1 offers top-tier professional features, its installation process is designed to be beginner-friendly. The machine is divided into four main modules, each pre-assembled with key components. Users only need to connect the frame using plug-in connectors, ensuring a quick and stable assembly process.",
      "The newly developed support kit now allows users who select the 4'11\"x8'2\" version to choose between installing a 4'11\"x4'11\" half-size board or the full 4'11\"x8'2\" size, based on their specific needs. It\u2019s like having two large-format machines in one, and can easily switch between them as needed.",
      "This accessory kit, valued at $99, is completely free for Kickstarter backers, as a special thank-you from Tyvok. We invite you to take advantage of this offer and enhance your creative projects with greater flexibility and freedom!",
      "For business owners with mass production needs, the Spider S1 supports controlling multiple machines from a single computer. This allows you to execute the same or different tasks across several Spider S1 units simultaneously.",
      "The lightweight, integrated platform board is 70% lighter than conventional honeycomb boards, making it ideal for large-format projects.",
      "Its unique elevated design effectively aids in venting the smoke generated during laser cutting.",
      "The Tyvok expandable platform board is lightweight, easy to expand, easy to clean, heats evenly, and does not require a steel plate.",
      "*Please note that the platform board needs to be added separately as an add-on.",
      "Tyvok will provide a 1-year warranty on machine parts and hardware, 3-month warranty on laser tubes and power supplies, and quality assurance service to all backers of this Kickstarter campaign.",
      "Any quality issues caused by non-human factors under reasonable and proper use. The warranty does not cover products that have been improperly stored, assembled, or used. It also does not apply to damage caused by accidents such as tearing, cutting, or scratching. If any such issues arise, we will supply free replacement parts.",
      "The warranty period starts from the date of delivery, and proof of purchase must be provided.",
      "Shipping costs will be charged separately after the project ends. Due to the large size and weight of the Spider S1 and some of its accessories, even slight fluctuations in international shipping rates can result in significant price differences. To ensure you don't pay more than the actual shipping cost, the shipping fee will be collected separately through a backer survey before shipping officially begins.",
      "You can refer to the following table for an estimate of the possible shipping cost range. We will also do our best to secure the most favorable rates.",
      "The Smileme team is committed to the continuous exploration in the field of laser engraving and cutting. Our team members come from world-renowned companies in various fields such as structure, algorithms, electronics, hardware, software, etc.",
      "Our team has experts in professional modeling. In the ongoing production process of medium and large format modeling, we deeply suffered from using the engraver and cutter with the current X-Y structure, which has problems like low space expansion, high cost, heavyweight, not enough portable, etc.",

      "The new generation of smartphone for simplicity and privacy: Smarter, simpler and faster.",
      "We\u2019re back on Indiegogo. Two years ago, we started our campaign for a smartphone that gives us back our freedom. Thanks to our backers, the Volla Phone was born again with a completely new operating concept and uncompromising privacy protection. Since then, thousands of devices have been shipped to over 55 countries around the world.",
      "Thus, a community of developers and users has emerged. Their ideas inspired us to prepare an evolutionary leap: The Volla Phone 22. It combines classy design, high performance, and hardware sustainability. Here\u2019s to a second-generation Volla OS that is even smarter, simpler, and more secure!",
      "IMMEDIATE AND INTELLIGENT",
      "Instead of countless apps, the Volla OS offers quick and effortless access to all important everyday functions and information from the springboard, your home screen. This takes smartphone accessibility to a level of efficiency never before seen.",
      "Customize the look and feel of the Volla OS with a dark and light mode or the translucent mode with the background image of your choice.",
      "And these are the #1 upgrades that no other smartphone has offered before:",
      "SAVE AND SECURE",
      "The Volla OS is based on the open-source Android Open Source Project (AOSP) and does without Google Apps and Play services to protect your privacy. A combination of measures and technologies ensures high security:",
      "And these are the novelties that make your Volla Phone 22 a fortress:",
      "From the springboard settings, activate the security mode with a single gesture, protected by a password:",
      "With the security mode, you can give your child a Volla Phone and keep your peace of mind. Be confident that your child won't see anything that is not suitable for children. Additionally, you can whitelist designated apps and sites such as access to a school's website.",
      "Additional advantage: If you have to use an app for work, study, or private use that could lead to user data collection, you can specifically block these connections or block the app completely if you don't need it.",
      "Optionally, you can get the Volla Phone 22 again with the mobile Linux operating system Ubuntu Touch, which is completely independent of Android and includes its own app store.",
      "Perfect for Linux users and minimalists",
      "Those who already use Ubuntu on their PC or laptop will find themselves in a perfectly tuned world with a familiar user interface that has been optimized for smartphones.",
      "Ubuntu Touch is also ideal for minimalists who mainly want to use basic smartphone functions. Benefit from the sidebar with the most go-to apps, which you can view at any time with a tap.",
      "And these are advancements that will turn your Volla Phone 22 into the all-in-one choice:",
      "It's a world premiere: We equip the Volla Phone 22 with a multi-boot function as standard. Via the system settings, you can install a second or even additional operating system as you would an app and simply select it at startup.",
      "With this we also want to give the community the chance to make more alternative operating systems easily accessible. A great chance for Sailfish OS, Droidian, Manjaro or Nemo Mobile.",
      "Initially, we will be able to install the OS on a microSD memory card. This allows for the half-terabyte (TB) space needed for several operating systems. We are in the works for research on the installation of the internal memory, too.",
      "Hardware. The perfect combination of aesthetics and performance",
      "With its minimalist design, the Volla Phone 22 conveys pure elegance and focus on the essentials. The main camera with dual-lens is embedded in the back of the case, which lies flat and sleek and reduces bulk.",
      "The tempered glass layer not only protects the lenses but also gives the smartphone a high-quality look. The rounded sides make the Volla Phone 22 fit perfectly in the hand.",
      "The colors available are fresh white and elegant black with a piano finish.",
      "Device features make for cutting-edge performance.",
      "With a 3x higher camera resolution, a 2x higher memory capacity, and the MTK Helio G85 processor with optimized performance through Mediatek HyperEngine technology, the new Volla Phone 22 is well prepared for the future.",
      "In addition to two nano-SIM cards, the design now allows you to use a memory card of up to half a terabyte at the same time.",
      "Please note that we provide a white fingerprint sensor with a silver frame for the series producton of the white variant. This looks even lighter and more elegant.",
      "Sustainability taken a step further.",
      "Together with the slim Volla OS operating system and long-standing software updates, the Volla Phone 22 also scores in sustainability.",
      "But this time we go the additional step.",
      "At the request of the Volla community, the Volla Phone 22 includes a user-replaceable battery that also provides up to 350 hours of standby. With its 4,500 mAh power, it allows plenty of charging cycles backed by Libitum polymer technology.",
      "The manufacturing is once again engineered with high-precision machines in Germany.",
      "OUTPERFORMING TECHNICAL STATS",
      "We offer donors outside Europe to check carefully if the Volla Phone 22 supports the frequency bands of their provider's mobile network. The good news is that the Volla Phone 22 will support even more frequency bands than the previous model for international use.",
      "From the beginning, we developed the Volla Phone with you in mind. We envisioned an option for our users to stay independent and protect their data.",
      "We are not venture capital-funded and solely operate on existing cash flow. With this approach, we achieve stability and independence. However, it presents us with challenges for new products.",
      "With your help, we can create a private space full of personal freedoms on your smartphone.",
      "We appreciate any support for the project, be it a small or larger donation. We plan to reward your efforts in helping us restore your privacy. Volunteer translators and beta testers are also needed again. Please stay tuned for updates and feel free to write to us.",
      "Get the special Indiegogo discount on the presumed retail price of 439 EUR for backing our project:",

      "The bag offers space for a key fob as well as additional documents such as your credit card, ticket, or ID card",

In October, the delivery of the first Volla Phone started on time. Less than a year later, the Volla Phone X, a robust and splash-proof model, also was created. Since then, thousands of Volla Phones have gone to over 55 countries around the world.",

      "We have already prepared many things. The remaining risks are delivery delays for raw materials for the packaging and for two components whose production we already commissioned. For the production, we have regional partners and are not dependent on supply chains.",
      "There may also be a delay in shipping the reward due to a lack of drivers at German logistics companies. However, we do not observe any significant delays from our partners DHL and DHL Express in our daily business yet.",
      "For the technical implementation of the software, we have a successful proof of concept for all innovations.

We wanted to give you the feeling of being in a village of people you love while you find things you love.",
      "We love Pinterest, but like many others looking for alternatives, we are unhappy it has essentially become an ad-heavy image-based shopping platform. The ads are useful when shopping, but most of the time when we open the app, we just want to see awesome images, art, and ideas. To see one awesome image, you have to see four ads.",

      "People from all over the world can join your colony. While most people are awesome, if you want a lively group chat that's comfortable for you, where you can truly get to know others, their ideas, projects, and more, you'll need to filter people in/out in meaningful ways.",

      "IT ONLY STOPS WHEN YOU DO",
      "My name is Ged Alexander and I am a serving British soldier and have been a soldier for the last 19 years. I have a keen interest in entrepreneurship, fitness and well-being. Kouwi has been a long time dream of mine to give back to our society and help improve health and well-being in young people and young adults. Kouwi was inspired from a game I use to play when I was a child back in St. Lucia where I grew up. We would make a similar tool using old bucket lids and thick wire and this would keep all the children in the community entertained. That was an era with little electricity, console or online presence. Today me and my team have re-created this childhood game and hope to create a new sport around the apparatus called kouwi ball.",
      "KOUWI simply put is a running companion sport tool in the free form fitness category with a unique value proposition. An innovation with the simple goal of getting young people outside. It's fun, takes skill to use and enjoyable whether you use it alone or with friends. Kouwi encourages peer participation, making fitness more sociable and fun.",
      "In an increasingly tech driven society, outdoor activities can be seen as boring and monotonous. This product is designed to lure young people outside to do more physical activity which may help reduce the problem of obesity which is straining the NHS  and medical bodies around the world.",
      "KOUWI SPORT LIMITED has applied for patent protection in the USA, UK and China and have trademarked the name KOUWI.",
      "Your contribution at this stage will help us bring this new sport to reality and possibly change lives doing so. You will not only be the first to own this piece of kit but you may end up being a professional in the sport in no time.",

      "Kouwi \u2122is the central tool for Kouwi \u2122Ball, an innovative six-a-side, non-contact sport we are developing, featuring a pitching team, a running team, six bases, and a unique point system. This sport has the potential to become a global phenomenon, similar to pickleball or ultimate frisbee, with Kouwi \u2122as the essential equipment.",
      "Your investment opportunity",
      "You are invited to be a part of the future of sport\u2019s fitness and a new non contact act spot called kouwi ball. As an initial investor and supporter of the project we will get the opportunity to purchase your kouwi with a lifetime warranty. The number available with this offer will be limited and only for our loyal backers.",
      "Overall, our sales and marketing strategy will focus on promoting KOUWI as the go to fitness tool for every sport, a way to improve fitness and cognitive function. Through a mix of online and in-person sales channels, targeted social media and influencer marketing. We aim to establish KOUWI as a popular and highly sought after fitness tool and then introduce the sport kouwi ball.",
      "We then intend to introduce kouwi ball which is a six-a-side sport designed as a non contact team sport for professionals who have mastered the kouwi. This gives endless opportunity for growth and new business and revenue streams.",

      "Physical Rehabilitation: \n1. Low-Impact Exercise: Kouwi\u2019s rolling motion engages core, upper, and lower body muscles with minimal joint stress, ideal for soldiers recovering from lower limb injuries (e.g., ankle sprains, ACL repairs). A 2020 study in *Military Medicine* found low-impact activities improve strength and mobility in 78% of soldiers with musculoskeletal injuries within 12 weeks (Smith et al., 2020).",

Psychological Well-being: \nSocial Connection: Kouwi\u2019s team-based gameplay promotes camaraderie, vital for mental health. A 2022 *BMJ Military Health* study found group-based adaptive sports reduce PTSD symptoms in 70% of participants (Brown et al., 2022).",
      "Confidence Building: Mastering Kouwi\u2019s skills boosts self-efficacy, aligning with  Journal of Sport Psychology  (2020) findings on sports-driven resilience in injured persons including veterans",

      "As the first mover in this category, Sports Direct can establish itself as a pioneer in introducing a new sports trend to the UK market.",
      "2. Strong Market Fit:",
      "Aligns with the growing demand for inclusive, engaging fitness products that combine fun and exercise (e.g., 68% of UK consumers prioritize fitness products that are versatile and family-friendly, according to recent industry trends).",
      "Appeals to a broad audience: fitness enthusiasts, families, schools, and sports clubs, complementing your existing range of training and recreational equipment.",
      "Kouwi \u2122Ball\u2019s upcoming launch as a sport will drive demand for the apparatus, creating a recurring customer base for accessories and replacements.",

      "Kouwi \u2122is built with durable, lightweight materials (aluminium shaft, reinforced plastic wheel) to ensure longevity and customer satisfaction.",
      "Our  1 & 2 -year warranty on manufacturing defects minimise risk for retailers and customers.",
      "Competitive Advantage",
      "Unlike traditional sports equipment (e.g., footballs, rackets), Kouwi \u2122introduces a novel category that combines fitness, coordination, and play. Its versatility as both a standalone fitness tool and the core equipment for Kouwi \u2122Ball sets it apart from competitors. By stocking Kouwi, Sports Direct can differentiate itself from rivals like Decathlon or Amazon, capturing early adopters and building brand loyalty as Kouwi\u2122Ball gains traction.",
      "Kouwi \u2122is a versatile sports apparatus designed for users of all ages and skill levels, consisting of:",
      "Adjustable Metal Shaft: Telescopic design (3\u20136 feet) that doubles as a hiking stick, with interchangeable components for customization.",

      "Wheel: A lightweight, durable 13-inch wheel that moves only when propelled, challenging users\u2019 agility, coordination, and technique.",
      "While this is appealing the kouwi is new to the market and will take much marketing and social acceptance to really Catch on before the sport can be introduced.",

A crowdfunding campaign is a great way to get a large quantity of orders waiting to put that tooling to use right away so it quickly pays for itself by producing valuable parts, rather than sitting unused.",
      "Our first controller was successfully launched with a crowdfunding campaign, so we decided to do it again for the ViVi II. This time we put in even more time and effort planning our campaign, and used all the lessons and skills we learned to better prepare for manufacturing to scale up our volume to be able to offer a new, lower price.",
      "Finally, while the funding raised by a crowdfunding campaign is important for covering the costs of tooling and a large initial order, it's not the only reason we chose to launch on this platform again.  The value we received from backers of our first campaign, the interactions, feedback, and lasting relationships, played a monumental role in our long-term success and to this day continues to have an impact driving innovation and improvements with our technology.",

    "description": "The comic book spinner rack from our youth -- at an amazing price. And now it disassembles!",
    "company_name": "David Campiti",
    "allParagraphs": [
      "The comic book spinner rack from our youth -- at an amazing price. And now it disassembles!",
      "...I was a kid running after school on Tuesdays and Thursdays to McNamara's Drug Store to buy the newest comic books.  The Gold Key, Classics Illustrated, Harvey, and other comics sat on a large wooden magazine display. But the Marvels and DCs were proudly presented on two comic book spinner racks that formed the backbone of my comic book memories.",
      "Decades later, I purchased two spinner racks when I was running Innovation Publishing; they didn't quite have the graphics topper I remembered, but close enough. I'd schlep those racks to and from our minivan to the convention floor, usually scraping up my hands and arms in the process because the original shipping boxes were long gone.  But I loved how our comics looked displayed on those racks, both at Conventions and in my office.  I still have those racks, one of them in my office until recently showing off some of the comics Glass House Graphics produces for our clients.  I've spray painted it several times, oiled the bearings, and cursed the squeaking sound it makes because of a long-missing plastic piece that fit the pole.",
      "...Why the hell didn't someone make an AFFORDABLE comic book rack that could be easily taken to conventions -- and be assembled and disassembled so it wasn't cumbersome to carry?",
      "I mean, I looked on Etsy and eBay and discovered, IF they sold any comics spinner rack at all, it was insanely priced at $1,200.00 (just the rack, without the base and pole) to $1,500.00 each (complete, yet offering pickup only no shipping option).  Seriously insane!",
      "So, I checked Diamond Comic Distributors, and they theoretically sold one for $400.00 IF it was in stock (as I type this, it's not) plus shipping that could be $100 to $200 depending on where you are. Still a 6-foot monster box to transport, that meant basically SIX HUNDRED BUCKS for a comic rack, IF you could get it. Still insane!",
      "I contacted suppliers in the USA and all over the world to see if anyone still made the classic rack I was looking for.  Nobody did.  A few suppliers sold versions of a rack that just didn't look right. Nobody seemed to offer either version of the spinner rack long burned into memory. Some offered to build a custom rack. I was fine with that and gave specs. Then I discovered that SHIPPING from them to me, or drop-shipping from them to you, was between $150 and $200 for one rack!  That's crazy.  Nope.  Not happening.",
      "Then I thought about all those Conventions where I cut up my hands and arms and scraped up car seats and even damaged my dashboard trying to wedge comic racks into my car.  Enough of that!",
      "What If I designed a full-sized, 40-pocket spinner rack, with the long-remembered classic design, that could be taken apart and easily transported in a wheeled carrier?  SO, I DID!",
      "I kept a close eye (sometimes both eyes!) on the manufacturer building the prototypes --",
      "After we tweaked and fiddled and painted, it was ready.  It was a thing of beauty right from my childhood.",
      "I was pleased to discover that my redesign allowed me to ship the rack for about one-third of the cost UPS/FedEx/DHL/USPS quoted me for shipping the original rack design.  That meant I could simplify life for everyone by offering the spinner rack bundled with FREE USA SHIPPING!  What's more, we could offer economical shipping to Canada and most of Europe.",
      "I even worked with our manufacturer to select an optional, properly sized canvas carrier with three wheels for stability, to make the schlepping simple!",
      "Each carrier also sports its own custom spinner rack logo tag, so you immediately know which bag holds your rack --",
      "This spinner rack comes with TWO grand graphics topper designs, two of each, created by Glass House Graphics' letterer/designer Keith Gleason --",
      "What's more, all four headers are CUSTOMIZABLE!  You can ADD ON this alternate set of graphics toppers (two of each sold as a set)--",
      "(I'm particularly happy that the HEY, KIDS! finally has a comma where it belongs.)",
      "FIRST, A BIT ABOUT SHIPPING: Thanks to canny craftsmanship, careful package planning, and a whole lot of dumb luck, we found a shipping \"sweet spot\" that allows us to offer this Spinner Rack with U.S. shipping included in the price. What's more, shipping one rack to Canada only adds $25 to the total. And we can ship it to much of Europe for only $25 over that. AND we now can ship to Australia for only $80. Unfortunately, that shipping \"sweet spot\" does not extend to shipping to the rest of the world so I'm offering it to the countries where we can. DISCLAIMER: I have no control over Customs in any country, nor the upcoming administration's planned Tariffs, so I cannot predict or accommodate how they will affect/handle overseas shipments.",
      "PRODUCTION & TIMEFRAME: The examples you see in the photos and video are the prototypes made from my design; I'll be fine-tuning certain elements until production begins. The manufacturer drop-shipped the prototypes to me so I could see them boxed the same way you'll receive them. Our timeline is to ship in June 2025 for delivery in July. The manufacturer has assured us that production will only take 8 weeks, but we've padded the release schedule with two extra months to deal with any difficulties. Manufacturer will drop-ship directly to you, saving time and money. Only the T-shirts and such will be shipped from my office warehouse.",
      "Long-lasting design",
      "Powder-coated steel and dual-supported ball bearings should give this 21st Century Comic Book Spinner Rack long life, just like the original classic racks you remember.",
      "Reusability and recyclability",
      "The plastic bags and foam packing are re-usable when you break down the rack for transport. The double-box we ship to you can be re-used or recycled. Or both.",
      "Something else",
      "By drop-shipping to you directly from the manufacturer instead of shipping to a warehouse and re-shipped, we're saving time, money, and transportation resources for literally tons of freight.",

    "company_name": "Christoph Burkhardt",
    "allParagraphs": [
      "Eliminate 99.99% of airborne particles with groundbreaking plasma technology & never replace filters",
      "OneLife X is a high-performance air purifier with revolutionary plasma technology that filters your air with clinical precision. It uses a high-precision laser sensor to track even the smallest detectable particles in your air. Unlike other air purifiers, OneLife X produces no harmful ozone and has no costly filters to replace.",
      "To say Onelife X is the best air purifier to hit the market would be an understatement\u2014it\u2019s the future of air purification!",
      "Our next-generation air purifying plasma filter eliminates 99.99% of airborne particles without the need to replace the filter, ever.",
      "OneLife X uses a high-precision laser sensor that detects particles as small as 1 micrometer, then the plasma technology removes particles down to 0.01 micrometers, meaning it removes even viruses and ultrafine particles out of your breathing air that most purifiers miss.",
      "Most air purifiers use standard HEPA filters that are incapable of capturing particles smaller than 0.3 micrometer.",
      "OneLife X has metallic plates in the filter that act like giant magnets for all the pollutants in the air. When air is pulled into the device, it passes through the plasma field where pollution particles get charged up (ionized) so they stick right to the collector sheets.",
      "Using this plasma field to ionize the particles instead of forcing air through a thick filter means there's no restriction of airflow, so One Life X requires very little energy, runs virtually silently, and generates no harmful ozone.",
      "The independent lab test by IUTA shows that \u201cOneLife X can provide per hour, on average, about 121 cubic meters of air free of particles, including viruses and small exhaled droplets that are potentially virus-laden. The filtration efficiency for larger exhaled droplets is even larger, resulting in a CADR of 131 cubic meters per hour.\u201d",
      "The independent lab also tested for Ozone Emission. IUTA concluded that OneLife X does NOT add ozone to the room even after 60 minutes of constant purification. The lab stated: \u201cThe amount of emitted ozone lies with (1.6 \u00b1 1.8) ppb substantially below the limit of 50 ppb specified by UL 867-37.\u201d",
      "In the graph below you see the ozone concentration as a black line (with the OneLife X running full speed) and a red line (the natural background levels of ozone that are always present). They are almost identical and far lower than the officially accepted concentration of ozone in a room.",
      "HEPA? No thanks\u2014sounds like a bad infection.",
      "The OneLife X plasma filter never needs to be replaced. It\u2019s washable and dishwasher safe, meaning it won\u2019t pollute the environment with non-recyclable plastics and filter waste.",
      "This is as sustainable and affordable as it gets.",
      "Other air purifiers use pricey HEPA filters that need to be changed often and cost more to operate. HEPA technology hasn't been updated in more than 70 years!",
      "OneLife X delivers the highest purification performance with the lowest energy consumption. At just 6 watts, it consumes less than an average LED lamp! This means you get the most clinically clean air while saving money on energy bills.",
      "Other air purifiers cost $30-120 per year because they require a high-speed fan to press air through fibreglass mats inside the air filter. High-speed fans and pressure means loud, disrupting noise levels plus increased energy consumption, resulting in higher energy bills.",
      "Our technology purifies the air without restricting airflow, so it doesn't need high-energy fan pressure. This enables us to run the fan at a super low ventilation rate, making the purifier absolutely silent",
      "It\u2019s so quiet you can run it right next to your bed\u2014try that with a HEPA filter!",
      "OneLife X looks and feels like a piece of furniture. Our team of designers crafted OneLife X to fit effortlessly and beautifully into any modern-day home or office.",
      "Plus, it operates standing or laying flat, so it fits in any space.",
      "The textile cover is made from recycled PET plastic bottles, keeping that discarded plastic out of landfills and from breaking down into microplastics that can cause serious health issues.",
      "OneLife X\u2019s renewable filter design makes it the most sustainable filter on the market, purifying your air while protecting the plant.",
      "OneLife X alerts you when it is time to wash the filter, and has three air-purifying modes:",
      "OneLife X provides clinically pure air exactly where you want it with a tilt feature that lets you deliver clean-air immediately within your personal air space.",
      "The OneLife X app gives you detailed data on indoor air quality and outdoor pollutants so you can monitor your air quality from anywhere, effortlessly.",
      "Plus, the app lets you input your personal air purification needs (like if you have asthma, allergies or pets) and OneLife X adjusts its settings automatically!",
      "In addition to measuring pollutants in your air, OneLife X also measures temperature and humidity.",
      "The OneLife X app displays indoor AND outdoor air quality levels using the BreezoMeter. By getting the live outdoor pollution data from local air quality indices (AQIs), we are able to recommend if the air quality is good enough for your outdoor activities or for you to open the windows.",
      "The average human takes 17,000 breaths a day and inhales 2,000 gallons of air. Pure air is for everyone\u2014and so is OneLife X.",
      "*Add a carbon filter to your OneLife X to ensure that in addition to all the particles, all odors get absorbed from your air. Gases will get trapped and retained inside the activated carbon to provide you with clean air without any bad odors.",
      "New to Indiegogo? No problem. Follow these simple steps to get your own OneLife X.",
      "At the end of the campaign, we\u2019ll send you a survey to get your shipping information and deliver your OneLife X when manufacturing is completed",
      "Our story started over five years ago in Germany.

Or how about the time you needed a pen, only to realize you left it behind? That can be so annoying. Ever wished you had a pendant that was not only stylish but also incredibly useful?",
      "If you've faced these problems, then guess what? You\u2019ve come to the right place! I'm thrilled to introduce you to our latest creation: The Dark Fire\u2014a titanium multitool pendant lantern. It\u2019s a keychain lantern, an everlasting pen, a box opener, a pry bar, a bit driver, all packed into one sleek, space-saving design.",
      "This is not just a cool-looking accessory\u2014it\u2019s your everyday problem-solver. Whether it\u2019s finding your keys in the dark, jotting down a quick note, or effortlessly opening a box, The Dark Fire has got you covered.",
      "The Dark Fire is designed to be exceptionally compact, measuring just 13g. This super tiny size makes it incredibly convenient for everyday carry, fitting effortlessly on your keychain or as a pendant. Despite its small stature, it packs a range of useful features, proving that great functionality can come in a surprisingly small package. Its sleek and minimalist design ensures it remains unobtrusive while always being within reach when you need it.",
      "The Dark Fire is expertly designed for everyday carry, seamlessly integrating into your daily life with its compact and versatile functionality. Whether attached to your keychain or worn as a pendant, its practical features are always within reach. The sleek, minimalist design ensures that it remains unobtrusive yet readily accessible, making it an indispensable tool for handling everyday tasks with ease and style.",
      "Constructed from Gr5 titanium, the Dark Fire is designed for exceptional durability and strength. This high-grade material offers an outstanding strength-to-weight ratio, ensuring that the Dark Fire withstands the rigors of daily use while remaining lightweight. Its natural resistance to corrosion keeps it performing flawlessly and looking pristine, even under challenging conditions.",
      "Drop Resistant, Crush Proof",
      "Engineered to handle tough situations, the Dark Fire pendant is resilient against drops and impacts. It can endure drops from any height and withstand being run over by a vehicle, guaranteeing that it remains functional and reliable no matter the circumstances.",
      "Weather Proof",
      "The Dark Fire is built to face the elements with confidence. Its Gr5 titanium body and precise CNC machining ensure it is weatherproof, capable of withstanding rain, sleet, hail, and snow. This resilience ensures that the Dark Fire continues to perform reliably, no matter the weather or conditions.",
      "Though it's small, designing The Dark Fire was no small feat. The challenge lay in making it compact yet multifunctional, balancing aesthetics with utility. But we did it! Now, let us share how The Dark Fire came to life.",
      "Around February this year, we first envisioned creating a keychain lantern. The idea was simple: we needed a keychain lantern to help us quickly identify our belongings, like keys, in the dark. But as we brainstormed, we thought\u2014what else could it be? We realized how frustrating it can be when you need a pen but don\u2019t have one, especially when you're out and about. So, we decided that an everlasting pen would be a great addition. With the growing popularity of online shopping and deliveries, everyone needs a tool to open boxes or perform small tasks from time to time. We\u2019ll dive into these functions in more detail later, but that\u2019s how the idea for The Dark Fire was born.",
      "Personalize with Custom Colors",
      "Different tritium tube colors can evoke different moods and feelings. By choosing various colors based on your preference or mood, you can add a touch of personalization and fun to your everyday life. Whether you want a vibrant glow or a subtle hue, the Dark Fire allows you to easily switch colors, enhancing both its functionality and your daily experience.",
      "Quick, Glue-Free Installation",
      "Traditional tritium tube installations typically require glue to secure the tube in place, which comes with several drawbacks. First, the installation process can be complicated and messy. Second, replacing the tube is inconvenient, often necessitating the use of adhesive removers. However, our innovative design allows the tritium tube to be installed without glue, using the everlasting pen tip to secure it inside. This tool-free and adhesive-free installation process makes both the initial setup and future replacements much more convenient.",
      "Smooth Writing, Anytime, Anywhere",
      "Never find yourself without a reliable pen again. The Dark Fire's everlasting pen tip offers a smooth and consistent writing experience that outperforms traditional pencils. Its advanced ballpoint mechanism and reliable ink supply ensure that every stroke is smooth, precise, and easy to read. Whether you're jotting down notes, drafting important documents, or sketching, the Dark Fire guarantees flawless writing performance every time.",
      "Durability & Waterproof:",
      "Built to endure, the Dark Fire features a titanium body and graphite pen tip, making it exceptionally durable and waterproof. It withstands wear and tear, harsh outdoor environments, and extreme temperatures, ensuring that it remains a reliable writing tool through years of use. Its robust construction means it's ready for any adventure, maintaining its functionality and appearance over time.",
      "Smudge-Proof Durability",
      "The Dark Fire\u2019s smudge-proof ink is ideal for important documents and personal journals. Unlike pencil marks that can smudge, fade, or be erased, the Dark Fire\u2019s ink provides a permanent, professional-looking finish. Your writing remains clear and legible, preserving the integrity of your work for years to come.",
      "Easy-to-Swap Tips",

Opting for the Dark Fire not only saves time and effort but also contributes to reducing environmental impact. Make a sustainable choice and enjoy lasting quality.",
      "The Dark Fire Pendant includes a versatile 1/6-inch bit driver, enhancing its functionality beyond just writing and prying. This compact bit driver allows you to tackle minor repairs and adjustments on the go. Whether you need to tighten a loose screw or make a quick fix, the bit driver ensures you're always prepared. Its integration into The Dark Fire Pendant design maintains the sleek profile while adding significant utility, making it an indispensable tool for everyday carry.",
      "The Dark Fire Pendant features a cleverly designed tapered tip that maximizes its utility. This unique shape allows the Dark Fire to function as a box opener, pry bar, and nail puller. The slight gradient of the tip makes it easy to slip under lids and nails, providing the leverage needed for prying and pulling tasks.

      "In addition to the standard sandblasted finish, we offer anodized options in blue, purple, and PVD black. Each color brings a unique look and feel, so you can choose the one that best matches your style. We\u2019ve also included a glow tube as a default accessory with every pendant.

      "Traditional Solar Panels:  Imagine you're trying to throw a ball through a small hoop. The angle matters, and you've only got one shot. If the ball bounces off, you miss. That's how traditional solar panels work with photons. The photons have to come in at the perfect angle to go through the protective glass and hit the silicon beneath. If they bounce off, that energy is wasted.",
      "Enter TIPA:\nWith TIPA, it's like giving that ball multiple chances to get through the hoop. We use special lenses that bend and guide the light (the ball) into our 3D solar pipe. If a photon doesn't make its mark on the first go, it bounces around inside, giving it more chances to interact and transfer its energy. More chances mean more energy captured!\n\nAnd here's the cool part: this isn't just a tweak in solar tech; it's a groundbreaking approach that you won't find anywhere else.\n\nSo, in a nutshell: TIPA gives sunlight many shots to power up, making it a true game-changer in the solar world! ????",

      "The SOFTCOOL15 is the smaller of our two soft coolers.",
      "The SOFTCOOL20 is the larger of our two soft coolers with some added mobility and some cool additional features:",
      "The demands of everyday calls for a durable backpack dedicated to just that.",
      "Our 2-in-1 Cooler Backpack is a combined 50+ liters of thoughtfully designed storage to keep you organized, and still be comfortable enough to wear on any commute.",
      "DAM Coolers was started in 2016 as an idea between a couple of crazy students who just wanted to get the best grade in a school project.\nOnce we got the idea, we knew that we had stumbled upon something BIG, such that before finishing we were already making real business plans.",
      "We gave it all we had, we even started gluing together stuff and 3D printing parts ourselves in our garage until we made our first prototype.",
      "Our first DAM Cooler performed so well that there was no turning back from that point on. We also got \"The Most Likely to Start a Business\" award, and did just that!\nWe started DAM Coolers, LLC and here we are today.",
      "The design and engineering for  our first two hard coolers are completed. This covers the 25 and 35 Quart Coolers. The 25 Quart cooler is farther along in the process however with the Mold Construction Fully completed today. We need only take delivery of our Molds and Tools at our factory and start full production. As a matter of fact we have received pre-production samples of the cooler from the Mold manufacturer only to have it undergo some Aesthetic and Quality updates. Today they are all completed, all 13 of them. Yes, 13. Because of our unique design every piece of our Hard Cooler was designed from ground up to assure performance and quality. This took time, but it greatly reduces our risk in the future.",
      "Speaking of risks, as with all crowdfunding projects there many involved. Project Design, Engineering Completion, Partner search and vetting, Manufacturing and Supply chain issues, you name it. All of these can make you a little nervous especially when you are making an advance payment. I personally order a lot from crowdfunding sites like indiegogo and kickstarter so I know what its like to wait 3 months for a new bike helmet or 8 months for a wrist watch to get to me. This is why I took a lot of the risk out of the whole experience for you. With the Molds hot and ready to make your coolers, the biggest risks I predict are the year \"2020\" and its shenanigans. Yes, you know what I mean. I won't even go there.",
      "So we started out with our DAM Coolers Hard V.I.P Coolers almost 5 years ago, and we spent most of the year promoting them for a Summer 2020 launch and delivery. Today we have in addition to the Hard Cooler, our SOFTCOOL Series of Soft Coolers and our 2-in-1 Backpack Cooler. These are not secondary products, they are our 'next thing' at DAM Coolers, but today we have them ready for you to pre-order also. \nAnother set of products with all the risk taken out of them for you. Design and Development is 100% done, and our factories are waiting to produce them for you.",
      "With everything noted, the risks are still there. Supply chain issues may persist with our suppliers and their global partners, but be assured that plans have been made in advance to ensure that they are as ready as feasible.",
      "Other risks include fulfillment. This includes everything from 'after our products have been manufactured, packaged and put at the factory door on the way to you'. We 'may' face similar issues that are faced today with existing supply lines. As FedEX, UPS, DHL and the rest are facing a near crisis mode with late and epileptic deliveries, so are the shipping lines.",
      "We have partnered with reputable fulfillment partners that will not only try to get your goods to you as fast as possible, they will also ensure that your goods are safe and secure, with their strategic stations all over the USA and the world.",
      "So, despite all the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic delays we have been able to push forward to get the the stage that we are now, even with multiple products on offer.",
      "Unlike other campaigns that want you to pay in advance for research and production we have taken risks and gone ahead with as much as we can. We did this because we believe our company and products and we don't want you to wait too long before you have your DAM Coolers.",
      "As mentioned earlier the our factories are primed and ready.",
      "I am a Systems and Industrial Engineer and I personally have 12 years of manufacturing experience from; Food processing, Food and Beverage manufacturing, Milling, Plastics, Aerospace, Automobile and Energy manufacturing operations, and I have worked in, lived in and visited places in China, India, UK, Nigeria, Colombia, and of course the good old USA, so I know most of all the issues that may arise and where to find a solution if I do not have it myself.",
      "We are Committed to the success of this project in its entirety and we have put extraordinary planning in place. If things do not go as planned, we pledge to you that we will communicate timely and transparently.",

      "Key Expertise:",
      "Stress Reduction: EVANES initiates balance within the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS), fostering swift relaxation and stress reduction.",
      "Improved Sleep Quality: By calming the mind and body, EVANES facilitates better sleep patterns, helping users achieve a deeper and more restful sleep.",
      "Enhanced Mood: Regular use of EVANES can uplift mood and promote a sense of well-being by reducing anxiety and promoting relaxation.",
      "Cognitive Clarity: EVANES not only soothes the body but also sharpens the mind, fostering mental clarity and focus, leading to improved cognitive function.",
      "Vagus Nerve is our tenth cranial nerve. It is now well known to control majority of our most important organs making it hugely important opportunity to enhance our wellbeing. Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) is an effective treatment to correct imbalance in the autonomic nervous system caused by excess stress.",
      "We know now that stress is either a cause or a contributory factor in over 85% of chronic diseases, especially those that increase as people age. Stress is reflected in people's daily lives, for example with sleep disturbances, anxiety and depression. Finding effective treatment for stress is a medical, economic and social challenge. VNS has been proven to be an effective treatment for stress.",
      "The vagus nerve plays a key role not only in stress, but a myriad of diseases such as depression, epilepsy, hearing loss, sleep problems, chronic pain, memory problems and digestive disorders.",
      "In the case of excess stress, the balance in the autonomic nervous system is upset and sympathetic overactivity (hyperarousal) develops, which in turn is treated by activating the parasympathetic system.",
      "Good parasympathetic activity is a prerequisite for well-being and health. For centuries, mankind has been aware of various breathing techniques and other means like yoga to achieve a response similar to parasympathetic activation. However, scientific evidence of their effectiveness is still lacking.",
      "Since the vagus nerve is responsible for parasympathetic function, and it's known that all of the messages it sends from the brain to our organs are bioelectric, electrical stimulation is an effective treatment for stress symptoms and therefore also promotes healthy ageing and supports the general wellbeing.",
      "Stress Reduction Through Advanced VNS: EVANES utilizes non-invasive electrical vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) to manage and reduce stress effectively. By activating the parasympathetic system, it helps restore balance to your central autonomic network, improving resilience against stress-induced health issues.",
      "Enter Your Flow State: Experience deeper focus and enhanced performance with EVANES. tVNS helps quiet the prefrontal cortex and activate brain areas responsible for skill execution and concentration. This advanced stimulation supports you in achieving a flow state, where productivity and creativity flourish.",
      "Simple, Safe, and Non-Invasive: With EVANES, embrace a simple, safe, and non-invasive method to stimulate your nervous system, encouraging a balanced and harmonious mental state conducive to both daily tasks and high-level performance.",
      "EVANES utilizes a sophisticated bio electricity, specifically engineered with the right amplitude, pulse width, and voltage, all designed to interact effectively with the nervous system. These signals are crafted to stimulate auricular branches of Vagus nerve, producing very fine electrical currents that activate the nerve without discomfort.",
      "This form of stimulation is congruent with the body's own mechanisms, as the Vagus nerve inherently uses electrical signals to communicate internally. EVANES offers a non-invasive approach to wellness, ensuring it is a safe option for managing stress and anxiety.",
      "EVANES is programmed to perform a unique skin contact test before treatment begins. This test ensures that the electric current is transmitted through the skin.",
      "Furthermore, EVANES's design and operation adhere to high standards of safety and efficacy, ensuring that it is a reliable and trustworthy tool for those seeking to improve their mental and physical well-being through nerve stimulation.",
      "Utilizing cutting-edge proprietary techniques such as algorithm driven signal and adaptive power control, EVANES' specialized designs are crafted to create peaceful experience. By integrating bio-electric modulation, these designs effectively harmonize natural body rhythms, significantly reducing stress levels.",

      "Smart Projector with AI-Powered Storybook and Song Creation Platform",
      "Key features to help you DIY Fairy Tales, Bedtime stories, Picture book and even generate songs for your kids!",
      "With the Creator token, you can custom create your own content for your kids. You could also browse other works on our Story OS.",
      "IOS and Android App Available:",
      "Currently, hardware development has finished. We kicked off our First batch assembly:",
      "We have launched the IOS and Android App:",
      "The founders of Knock Knock Fairytales are a pair of Chinese high school brothers, Chris and Tony. Their initial intention for this project stemmed from an educational public welfare project that Chris and Tony participated in near their school.",
      "They found that the reason why many children from poor families wander the streets and idle around is actually the lack of good educational resources.",
      "\"The core concept of this project is not to charge for education. We hope that education can be as fair as possible, so that children can choose what kind of educational opportunities they want to receive.  With the possibly limited company of their parents, they can guide their own lives,\" said Chris Lai.",
      "Currently, Knock Knock Fairytales (Knock AI) has been launched on WeChat Mini Program, App Store, and Google Play, and users can use it for free. The app has accumulated over 100,000 readers in China and 2,000-3,000 registered active users.",
      "The app has also been downloaded over a thousand times in the US market. In terms of investment, the company has received RMB 3 million in financing, including a US$250,000 investment from Google Cloud.",
      "Let AI tell stories in just 3 minutes",
      "The Knock Knock AI Mini Program has set up two entrances for children and parents respectively. After selecting their identities, they will enter different operation modes:",
      "And at night, parents can also use a projector to project the story onto the ceiling and lie comfortably in bed with their children to enjoy bedtime. With the team's deeply adapted StoryOS and the hardware under development, the projected image can even spread to the entire room, allowing children to enter the fairy tale world they created themselves.",
      "\"The combination with the new hardware is not simply installing a software, but overturning the design of existing devices, re-adapting and scheduling the AI, making it easy for children to use, and ultimately presenting a new interactive mode different from projectors or TVs,\" said hardware designer Gao Ruotong.",
      "Compared to other AI education and companion products, what makes Knock Knock Fairytales unique as a storyteller lies in its \"intangibility.\" Zuo Dewei, the technical director of Knock Knock Fairytales, explained to Intelligent Emergence: \"Almost everyone has an imaginary friend in their growth. The key is not in the 'friend,' but in the 'imaginary'.\"",
      "He believes that many AI applications based on large models that give specific images to this imaginary friend will actually limit children's imagination. \"If I really give it a voice, an intelligence, it will suddenly become very creepy.\"",
      "On the contrary, they hope that AI can become a \"crutch\" for children's creativity, helping them to visualize their ideas one by one and preserve them in the form of personalized data for a long time, recording the growth of children's thinking and creativity.",
      "Secondly, due to the operation mechanism of existing large models based on probability prediction rather than actual understanding, the problem of \"hallucination\" (generating seemingly reasonable but actually inaccurate or completely fabricated information) cannot be avoided.",
      "To address this issue, Knock Knock Fairytales takes steps such as keyword shielding to ensure that the content is harmless to children's health, while allowing the AI to maintain maximum freedom in story creation. For example, when a character travels from point A to point B, Knock Knock Fairytales only makes the scene switching and the character's actions conform to the logic of the real world, rather than being limited to preset scenes and paths like game systems.",
      "\"The path of a character in a game is fixed, and the scene switching must be reasonable. In this case, it cannot complete too many steps through AI, and it must be controlled by humans. But we don't need to control AI, AI can fully utilize its full creative talent, we just have to let it not do anything.\"",
      "Finally, back to AI story creation itself, it is not easy for ordinary people to make large language models tell novel stories like fairy tale experts.",
      "On the one hand, this is due to the lack of prompt writing ability of ordinary people, who cannot fully guide the large model. On the other hand, it is because ordinary large models have not received enough high-quality fairy tale creation training, resulting in a small number of output content that meets expectations and low quality.",
      "In fact, the creation of fairy tales is very difficult in itself - an excellent children's story contains a complex structure, not only must be logical, full of plot, in line with children's cognitive and understanding level, but also full of imagination and freshness, both profound connotation and interpretability, so as to entertain and educate.",
      "This has also become a major difficulty in the development process of the Knock Knock Fairytales team.",
      "Faced with the problem of giving the AI Little Mermaid an \"immortal soul,\" the Knock Knock Fairytales creative team solved it this way:",
      "First, let the large language model undergo multiple rounds of deep training, and the training dataset consists of classic stories that have entered the public domain and children's stories, picture books, illustrations and other related content created by the creative team themselves.  The model learns many of the creative rules of children's stories and illustrations, forming a personality system that can imitate human creators.",
      "After that, the team designed and optimized the entire event flow from user demand to the final output of the picture book:",
      "After receiving the user's voice or text requirements, the large language model within Knock Knock Fairytales will first create a story skeleton based on the input variables, and then \"grow flesh\" based on the skeleton.",
      "These results are then processed by a deeply trained model for style adjustment and polishing, and finally form a text that can be converted into voice and illustrations, building a complete multimedia picture book experience for children. The team leader said that Knock Knock Fairytales will also launch a video function in the future to allow children to immerse themselves in the picture book story.",
      "It is worth mentioning that Knock Knock Fairytales has also launched a \"voice customization\" function that allows AI to tell stories to children on behalf of parents, supporting almost all mainstream languages.",
      "With just a sentence of voice from parents, Knock Knock Fairytales can use their voices to tell the stories created by their children, and in the beta version, parents can even independently voice the narration and characters of the story.",
      "This function will only appear in the storytelling session and will not cover all voice interaction scenarios in the app, avoiding the \"uncanny valley effect\" of AI saying unusual words in the parents' voices. In this way, the AI-created story is told through the mouths of the parents, which can add a bit more intimacy and \"human touch.\"",
      "Next, the Knock Knock Fairytales team will rapidly iterate on the product at the software and hardware levels.",
      "In the future, what Knock Knock Fairytales hopes to achieve is to allow every child to have their own personalized echo box to record their precious cornerstone memories - every imaginary friend in their childhood, every \"chuunibyo\" story, and every colorful unicorn that may be forgotten when they grow up.",

With its frame as a vessel, it harmoniously fuses music and home aesthetics, serving not only as a CD player but also as a striking decorative piece\u2014an artistic symbol that enriches and elevates the ambiance of daily life.",
      "Inspired by the poetic and timeless nature of art frames, MusicFrame M1 elegantly \"embeds\" music within its frame. Each CD transforms into a flowing piece of artwork, with melodies dancing within the frame and time standing still between the notes, imbuing the space with an artistic ambiance.",

The rotating CD resembles the path of time, while the intricate electronic panel is subtly hidden within, like a poetic dialogue between modern industry and art.",
      "A beam of light pierces the darkness, with the rotating CD moving like a dancer in the interplay of light and shadow, its intricate structure softly outlined. Alternatively, different backgrounds can infuse it with various colors and scenes, each adding its own unique expression.",
      "With the rise of digital music, CD players are slowly disappearing. Even if there is a cherished stack of CDs at home, they often remain untouched, unable to be played due to the lack of a device. This sense of powerlessness leaves one with a feeling of regret.",
      "CoolGeek MusicFrame M1 helps you rediscover the lost sounds and memories, allowing you to experience music in its purest form.",
      "A digital display is seamlessly embedded in the frame, with playback information subtly emerging through the transparent acrylic, as if dancing in light and shadow. This design fuses music and art, creating a harmonious blend of poetic beauty and practical elegance.",
      "CoolGeek MusicFrame M1 CD player supports playback via Bluetooth(up to 10m range) and a 3.5mm Aux input only. It does not have built-in speakers, so it cannot play audio independently and requires an external speaker system to fully experience the music.",
      "CoolGeek MusicFrame M1 doubles as an art piece that can be mounted on the wall to add depth and texture to your space, or placed on a table, effortlessly integrating into your d\u00e9cor without taking up much room.",
      "MusicFrame M1 comes with a remote control, allowing you to effortlessly manage playback modes. Whether it's switching tracks, adjusting volume, or selecting your preferred playback method, everything is at your fingertips.",
      "It's powered by a replaceable battery with an impressive 8-hour battery life, and conveniently, you can use the commonly available 18650 lithium batteries on the market.",
      "CoolGeek is an innovative brand dedicated to providing the most fashionable and cutting-edge high-end electronic products and accessories for young consumers worldwide. The brand story began with two founders who love both technology and fashion, having worked for a well-known tech company for many years. They love fashion, pursue quality, and also understand the trend of technology development. They are good at analyzing industry pain points, so they decided to establish their own brand to provide better high-end design products for young people.",
      "CoolGeek's brand concept is \"born for a cooler you\", representing the brand's understanding of young consumers and their lifestyle. CoolGeek firmly believes that modern technology products and fashionable design can be integrated to become a necessity of young people's lives, and also an extension of their personality expression and attitude towards life.",
      "In the future, CoolGeek will continue to dedicate itself to providing the most cutting-edge technology products and the most fashionable designs. CoolGeek hopes to inspire the new generation of young people to pursue their desired lives more bravely, to live with values, and to live with quality.",

      "New ways of playing chords",
      "We are Akuto, a studio based in Switzerland. We strive to put great design in service of music making. Many members of our team either make music themselves or have a close link to it and as you can guess, it is from our own struggles that the idea of the Chord Machine stems from. We hope you'll like it as much as we do. We kept what we think is  essential and crammed it inside this deceptively simple looking device. Enjoy discovering!",
      "The Chord Machine AKT-0.1 is an innovative MIDI controller designed for making chord progressions easy and fun to play as well as combining and tweaking effects, all within a compact and durable device. Designed to accompany you from the start of your musical journey and beyond, the Chord Machine will keep to evolving with new features that you will continue to use and explore in your productions.",
      "As a team, we are committed to push the boundaries of what is possible with the Chord Machine, and we have a lot of exciting ideas that we are eager to develop. By getting the Chord Machine, you are not only gaining access to its current features but also future updates that will provide even more ways to play and explore your creativity.",
      "Our goal is to provide endless inspiration for your music-making endeavours.",
      "The first thing you'll notice with the keyboard is that it is arranged in an isometric pattern. This allows us to achieve many things not possible on a regular piano keyboard. Let's dive into each aspect.",
      "The Chord Machine offers a revolutionary approach to note selection for chords and melodies, thanks to its intuitive grid-like system. With three keyboard modes to choose from, you can easily switch between different methods of note selection and unlock a whole new world of creative possibilities. Whether you're a seasoned musician or just starting out, the Chord Machine makes it easy to experiment, opening up new avenues for musical expression",
      "The Tonnetz mode is a powerful feature that sets the Chord Machine apart from other MIDI devices. By allowing you to visualise music in a completely new way.",
      "With the Tonnetz mode, each note is separated by a repeating interval in the same direction, enabling you to easily transpose chord shapes to different root notes. This means that even with just a few basic chord shapes, you have access to an entire library of chords that can be played in any key. With this unique feature, the Chord Machine empowers musicians to explore new sonic territory and create music that's truly their own.",
      "The Tonnetz mode is more than just playing chords. It simplifies and makes learning music theory more intuitive. Basic chord shapes can help you grasp the musical distance between two notes with just a glance at the grid. Even scales can be understood in the same way. For a complete understanding, we will provide a tutorial on how to use Tonnetz on our website and manual.",
      "With Accordion mode, you can concentrate on chord progressions as each key plays a complete chord. Switching from A minor to A major is as easy as pressing the key beneath it. And that's not all. You can play other chord types, such as major seventh and many many more.",
      "The Chord Machine offers a versatile array of playing modes, including the classic Piano mode.",
      "The Piano is the traditional layout we all know and you can have it on the Chord Machine. The black and white keys are represented by illuminated built-in LED's of the keyboard. Starting with 4 isometric rows, you get 2 continuously playable piano rows.",
      "We believe having these 3 modes allows you to work differently depending on where you are in the making process of a song and lets you have fresh eyes each time you get back in the only mode that matters: creative mode.",
      "To wrap up with the hardware design, our device features a square touchscreen that not only offers a new range of playing possibilities, but also adds nuanced control and provides valuable information to the user.",
      "You'll be able to see and change the keyboard mode or screen mode, know which chord or note you're playing and configure the playing field which is where all the fun happens. Let us see what the screen modes and playing field are and what they do.",
      "The playing field, defined by a circle and a dot in the middle, is where you can change the live effects of your sound and actually make the notes come out to your computer/DAW. The field can accommodate up to 4 effects.",
      "You can configure the placement and the range of each effect individually. For example an effect could go from 30% in the middle of the field all the way to 80% toward the edge. That's just half the story, next you have 3 screen modes you can choose from.",
      "Direct screen mode keeps things simple and allows you to slide your finger where you want without sending any notes. The latter will directly be generated as soon as you press a key.",
      "Bi-manual screen mode adds the possibility to select the notes with the keyboard and only make them sound once you touch the playing field. This puts you in the same mindset as guitar player.",
      "Strum screen mode pushes bi-manual mode further as the keys pressed are displayed as lines on the screen and can be finger picked or strummed. (It even got some people recalling some aspects of the legendary Omnichord from Suzuki which, in and of itself, makes our team very happy and proud!)",
      "All of this adds a lot of room for experimentation as you can combine between 3 keyboard modes, 3 screen modes and up to 4 effects. Hopefully, you don't have to remember it all, you can save up to 7 presets by holding both shift buttons and selecting one of the illuminated keys.",
      "Use the rotary knob to quickly navigate through semitones and the shift keys to jump through octaves. You can control the pitch to transpose any type of chord to your own voice or own liking and access a wide range of notes with a compact keyboard.",
      "By combining the shift and the rotary, you can also move your keyboard inside the Tonnetz grid and access more types of chords inside the accordion keyboard mode.",
      "Although asymmetrical, with a quick triple press on the rotary knob, the Chord Machine can be flipped 180\u00b0 to suit your preference. This action will make the user interface and the keyboard's LEDs flip horizontally as well as change the direction of the rotary knob and shift buttons.",
      "The Chord Machine Suite contains 1x MIDI keyboard 1x USB type C cable, 1x manual/poster, an optional MIDI-CV adapter and an early access to the Chord Studio web app beta. You'll be among the first to get a glimpse of the app and influence the development with your feedback.",
      "The Chord Machine is the centrepiece of our Suite. It is a quirky yet simple device that will adapt to your workflow or inspire you to try new ones. No matter your level, you'll find something you'll like in here.",
      "We know that many of you want to fully integrate the Chord Machine with your existing setup, which is why we've designed a USB-C to CV/MIDI adapter for this purpose.",
      "With this adapter, you can easily connect your Chord Machine to your favorite Synthesizer or any other CV/MIDI-compatible device, giving you even more options for creative expression. This adapter is an essential accessory for anyone looking to get the most out of their Chord Machine and we're happy to include it as part of our Suite rewards level.",
      "Here, we\u2019ve prepared something really special that you\u2019ll only be able to see for yourself once you receive it as we\u2019re sure you all like a little surprise. Our design team has put a lot of effort into this little piece that we\u2019re going to send it to you separately from the device so you can keep calm while we prepare the Chord Machine.",
      "We want you to enjoy playing chords instantly, nothing required. For that reason, we're developing a web app that you will be able access from any navigator so you can plug & play and start discovering the many features of the Chord Machine.",

      "Ultra-light, ultra-strong, ultra-foldable. The Nanobag is a premium shopping bag designed to be practical, comfortable and sturdy so that you\u2019ll actually use them on a daily basis. These bags are developed to be carried at all times with no inconvenience. Our customized high performance ripstop fabric is so soft that the bags practically disappear in your pocket, you don\u2019t even have to fold it, ever. Yet these bags can carry up to 66 lbs (30 kg) and thanks to the 3-layered handles they\u2019re also comfortable to use.",
      "If you share our campaign you\u2019re officially a rockstar!",
      "Nanobag 6.0 is the perfect everyday companion.",
      "Here's a closer look at the designs you can choose from in the campaign.",
      "... and here's our six different bag styles.",
      "We consume up to 5 trillion plastic bags per year, and it\u2019s just not necessary. Reusable bags are great for the environment, but most of them are bulky, poor quality or uncomfortable to carry. Our goal with the Nanobag was to make it both convenient and fun to be environmentally conscious.",
      "The fabric measures only .05mm thick, around half the thickness of a human hair.",
      "We're committed to creating high-quality products that you'll love. The bags are made with premium custom made nylon polymer fabric and we've put in place a thorough quality-control and testing process to make sure you receive a great final product. We guarantee that your bags will be of excellent quality.",
      "Our 3-layered handles makes the Nanobag comfortable to carry.",
      "We're 100% committed to making a climate positive product. That means that we give more back to the planet than we take. We already consider our bags environmentally conscious, as they contain less materials than other bags in their category and offset single use plastic bags. In addition, for each bag sold we\u2019ll plant one tree with Eden Reforestation. Trees are effective tools for removing carbon from the atmosphere. As an example, a mangrove tree can store up to 1750lbs (800kg) of CO2 over its growth life. As an added bonus trees also prevent soil erosion and help sustain ecosystems.",
      "We will plant one tree for every bag pledged for with Eden Reforestation Projects.",
      "We offer FREE international shipping to backers pledging for 4 bags and above. This time we've managed to organize  EU friendly shipping (delivery duty paid) to the following countries: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, and Spain. All parcels will be shipped with tracked air mail.",
      "Tiptop Things are a group of friends working together to infuse everyday items with premium quality and cutting edge technology.  Nanobag 6.0 is our 9th campaign, and you might have seen our previous Nanobag and Air Deck campaigns.",
      "This is our 9th campaign, and we\u2019ve fulfilled all our previous projects with positive feedback and happy backers. The Nanobag 6.0 has been developed and tested over the past few months and we are confident that we can do a good job with this. As with every project, there can always be unforeseen things along the way, but we've done our best to mitigate potential problems. Final products may differ slightly from the prototypes seen in the campaign as our bags are continually being developed and improved. Except stated otherwise please note that customers are responsible for taxes and duties that may be imposed on the shipments by their respective countries. We promise you that we're 100% committed to the project and that we\u2019ll keep you updated every step of the journey. Our goal is to satisfy every backer.",

      "But we are about reconnecting with the beautiful simplicity of coffee \u2026 it\u2019s just ground coffee and hot water.",
      "We set out to make the simplest coffee brewer that gives the quality of an artisan brewed pour-over, with minimal effort and no special brewing or pouring technique. By using the natural swelling of ground coffee, and encapsulating it in a deceptively simple brewer, we achieved this.",
      "You will get great quality coffee - every time - with less than 30 seconds hands-on time.",
      "Because all the coffee is made uniformly wet at the same time, and because the coffee expands to close any possible channels as carbon dioxide bubbles escapes from the roasted coffee, there is no need to do a pre-infusion phase - often called the 'bloom'.",
      "CO2 bubbling up - no 'bloom' needed",
      "The carbon dioxide harmlessly bubbles through the water while the coffee is brewing - like a soda. There is no risk of uneven extraction caused by channel formation, because as the coffee expands it closes out any micro-channels that start to form.",
      "The brewer is carefully designed so that the amount of stainless steel is perfect for chilling freshly boiled water to get it in the range of 195\u00b0F to 205\u00b0F, as recommended by the National Coffee Association and the Specialty Coffee Association.",
      "This means there is no need to preheat the brewer. And you don't need a temperature-controlled kettle.",
      "With less effort than it takes to use a coffee machine, you will get great quality coffee with every brew.",
      "It's the Simple Smart Coffee Brewer (or SSC Brewer).",
      "We addressed the entire user experience during the design process. We looked at every detail. From use, to clean-up and storage we have ensured that the brewer is a delight to use.",
      "For instance, when you are adding coffee to the brewer you rest it on the lid, so that any coffee 'fines' that pass through the filter do not end up on your kitchen surfaces. And when you have finished the brew, you can rest the brewer on the lid to catch any coffee drips.",

      "As you make the coffee one cup at a time, you can make it to suit individual tastes. If your partner likes  a strong, dark roast and you like a medium roast, a little less strong, that's no problem.",
      "If you select the SSC Brewer Partner Pack as a perk, you can both get coffee just the way you like it.",
      "Partner Pack Perk - Ideal for coffee loving couples",
      "The prime filter in the SSC Brewer is the coffee. The encapsulated coffee forms a uniformly dense and thin coffee bed as the coffee expands. This is perfect for getting an even brew.",
      "The laser cut holes in the brewer control the flow rate to give a well-balanced brew.",
      "It is designed to be used without any additional filters. But, if you want to, you can modify your coffee by adding secondary filters by using the Adaptor. This does not affect the extraction, which is only controlled by the brewer design and the coffee used. The exctration is completed before the brewed coffee touches a secondary filter.",
      "The Adaptor is also used to allow different coffee cup diameters to be used - up to 4\" outside diameter.",
      "You can use the 200 micron metal filter in the adaptor to remove more visible grounds.",
      "If you want to remove all the 'fines' and most of the coffee oils - that are extracted as emulsions rather than being dissolved in the water - you can use the small individual paper filters.",
      "Adaptor and optional metal or paper filters",
      "If your home grinder produces a lot of 'fines' you can add a tertiary (third) filter by simply stacking two adaptors with paper filters (you will need to purchase an additional adaptor for this). Too many 'fines' can cause the first paper filter to 'clog', which allows some coffee to pass through the air/overflow holes in the adaptor. The tertiary filter (the second paper filter) filters this 'pass-through' coffee to give the cleanest cup possible.",
      "Paper filters after using tertiary filter",
      "The 'clogging' of the first filter paper filter does not affect the quality of the coffee as is does with traditional pour-over, as the flow-rate is control by the stainless steel and coffee, not the paper filter.",
      "Whether you prefer the full, rounded, robust brew you get just using the coffee as a filter or the cleanest, brightest coffee from using two paper filters, you can get coffee just the way you like it.",
      "We set out to create a simpler, quicker, and more reliable way to get pour-over quality coffee. We did not set out to try to improve the taste of the coffee. But the testers we have been working with over the last 12 months, have often reported getting a 'better' cup of coffee. The most common comment is that it is less bitter.",
      "We have not done any rigorous and controlled testing, so we are not claiming you'll get a 'better' tasting cup of coffee. For a start, it depends what you are comparing it with. And there\u2019s also the possibility of confirmation bias playing a part. But we thought it appropriate to share this information and offer an explanation why you might experience a slightly different flavor profile compared to a traditional pour-over.",
      "We suspect the difference is to do with the coffee:water contact time. Even though the total brew time with the SSC Brewer is very similar to a traditional pour-over ... maybe a touch longer on average ...the water that sits above the filter plate does not mix with the coffee as is the case with a traditional pour-over. You can see below that the water is virtually clear.",
      "SSC Brewer with clear water above filter plate.",
      "Coffee/water slurry in traditional pour-over.",
      "The water is only in contact with the coffee as it passes through the shallow coffee bed (roughly 7mm thick) that is encapsulated between the filter plate and the filter body. This is normally about 30 seconds (in the 25 to 40 second range).",
      "As it takes longer for water to extract the bitter compounds from the coffee, this reduced contact time might be an explanation of the reported taste.",
      "Please note that this is our best hypothesis - not a proven fact.",
      "If you go ahead and start using the SSC Brewer, we'd love to get your feedback on the taste,",
      "The Simple Smart Coffee Brewer was designed so that you do not need any additional equipment to use it.",
      "You just need something to boil water in that you can pour into the brewer. A simple kettle is the obvious option.",
      "You certainly don't need to buy a special gooseneck or pouring kettle. Nor do you need a temperature-controlled kettle. You don't need scales or timers to measure the amount of water you have added.",
      "No need for pouring kettles",
      "Several people that have been testing the Simple Smart Coffee Brewer have stopped using typical drip coffee machines (or even French Presses). They found that they got better quality coffee from the SSC Brewer and it was easier to use.",
      "Also, they reported that there was no wasted coffee and the clean-up was far easier.",
      "It's important to note that the expected life-time of the SSC Brewer far exceeds the typical 5 to 10 years of a coffee machine.",
      "SSC Brewer much longer product life",
      "As the coffee is made directly into the cup, there is no need for any carafe that needs to be cleaned and stored.",
      "The SSC Brewer has a deceptively simple design, But there are many points of detail that have been incorporated into the design - such as having the silicone components act as protection whilst shipping.",
      "Here are a few illustrations of this attention to detail.",
      "Positioned to control flow-rate and, therefore, extraction.",
      "To create tight fit between plate and body.",
      "To allow air to enter the filter body as it drains.",
      "To ensure air can escape from cup as coffee flows in.",
      "Prevents spillage if fines choke paper filter & prevents seal with cup.",
      "To ensure lid stays cool for lifting filter.",
      "Our guiding principle of 'simplicity' significantly affects our design approach.",
      "We believe it is a simpler experience for the user if they never have to replace the product, or any of its parts. So, this is one of the reasons we work to create products that 'Strive to be Immortal'.",
      "We have used materials that should not degrade and become unusable over decades. We have used food grade silicone and 304 Stainless Steel. Both materials are expected to last decades.",
      "We have not used any plastics in the product. To be clear, silicone is not a plastic. It is a synthetic polymer of silicon, oxygen, hydrogen, and - in food grade silicone - carbon. Importantly, it does not breakdown into microplastics.",
      "There are no pressure seals, that always eventually require replacing during a product's life.",
      "We have designed out as many points of potential failure as we could. This is why the lid also acts as a 'handle' to lift the brewer when hot, if needed.",
      "There is only one manufactured joint- where the handle is triple-welded to the filter plate.",
      "We only provide the silicone in a brown color. Coffee will stain silicone over years of use, so we selected the color it would end up after years of exposure to coffee oils.",
      "To keep our business simple (we apply the same simplicity principle to our operations) we do not offer a warranty on the SSC Brewer.  We will, of course, honor any return policy of any sales channels we use.",
      "The design is such to make any warranty of negligible value to customers, given the modest price of the brewer and the incredibly low probability of any issues arising over any reasonable warranty period.",
      "Our policy is to do individual quality assurance on every brewer before it is ships from our facility in the USA.",
      "Concern about the environment is the second reason we work towards products that 'Strive to be immortal'.",
      "There are many positive environmental points to consider about the SSC Brewer:",
      "Given the environmental benefits, it is clear that there are costs savings associated with selecting the Simple Smart Coffee Brewer. Compared to traditional pour-over, typically,",
      "Single Use Coffee Machine",
      "If you use a machine that uses pods or k-cups, the annual savings can be quite significant.",
      "For instance, a couple that uses k-cups, with both drinking 2 to 3 cups of coffee a day each, would save about $600 a year by switching to the Simple Smart Coffee Brewer. That's just of coffee cost! (Based on price of Peets Major Dickason's Blend - prices as taken from Amazon August 2024 - K-cup $0.64 each, loose pre-ground $0.78 per ounce. SSC Brewer typically uses 0.4 oz per cup of this coffee, so saving per cup is 32,8 cents. At 5 cups of coffee per day for a year this equates to $598.60.)",
      "And you'll get a better tasting cup of coffee!",
      "The stainless steel components are production versions made on molds that are ready for a full mass production run, This is also the case with the silicone lid.",
      "Through rigorous testing  over the last year plus, we developed a better design for the Adaptor that can accommodate more cup internal diameters and manage issues associated with 'fines' in the ground coffee. We will be keeping the same overall dimensions, but changing the air/liquid flow paths. This will have no impact on the production schedule.",
      "The only other open issue we have is to finalize the packaging design, which again, will have no impact on the production timescales.",
      "We asses that the main risks associated with this project are related to logistics. This is one of the reasons we have decided to undertake an Indiegogo launch with shipping to the USA only.",
      "The other two reasons for this are:",
      "We expect to be shipping the first perks to our backers in November/December 2024.",
      "Update 11/4/24 - the estimated delivery date is now January 2025.",
      "Once we have reached the funding target we will be able to share more precise dates.",
      "Our funding goal will enable us to place an order for the minimum order quantity, as agreed with our manufacturing partner, and to modify the design of the Adaptor (as outlined above).",
      "As we have been testing production versions of the brewer for over a year now, we do not see any exceptional risks over those of normal business operations.",
      "Free shipping USA",
      "As we intend the SSC Brewer to be a direct-to-consumer product, we always want to be able to quote an 'as-delivered' price. Therefore, shipping is included in the Perks prices.",
      "Simple Smart Coffee Brewer",
      "Includes:",
      "Optional Items",
      "If you are using ground coffee from a grinder that produces a lot of 'fines' or if you simply want to have a third filtering step, we suggest that you purchase an additional Adaptor.",
      "The Standard SSC Brewer comes with 10 paper secondary filters, for demonstration purposes. If you want to buy additional paper filters you can order the packs of 200.",
      "Third Party Items",
      "Metal filters, with different filtering hole dimensions, are readily available. If you want to experiment with a different grade than the 200 micron version we supply, there is no reason you can't purchase these from another supplier.",
      "We strongly recommend that you use the SSC Brewer Filters, because of the grade of paper used (26 gsm). The 2.5 inch diameter paper filters are the same size as those from some other suppliers (normally listed as compatible with 'Aeropress'). These other paper filters  are designed to have the coffee forced through using a plunger based brewer. They will not work with the coffee being drawn through by gravity alone, as is the case with the SSC Brewer.",

However, you do not have the right to create and sell a similar concept as a development platform like the Sandwizz\u00ae Breadboard. The products created should be of a different character.",
      "Porting from PSoC 5 to Other Processors. Once you have developed an early prototype on the breadboard, it will not be difficult to port from PSoC 5 to another desired processor and architecture. This makes the Sandwizz\u00ae Breadboard an excellent starting point, and later, as the project progresses to a more advanced prototype stage, you can transfer the developed elements to the chosen architecture.",
      "Proof of Concept and Field Testing. The early prototypes with Sandwizz\u00ae can serve as a Proof of Concept, and if you transfer this design to the Sandwizz\u00ae Protoboard solution, you can conduct initial field tests of the device to be produced later and gather valuable insights for the continued project development. There will even be some extent of hardware modifications possible on the protoboard, by firmware upgrade, as long as they can be made with the internal components in PSoC 5 and its internal routing capabilities.",

      "By Co-funder Tommy Nielsen",
      "Inspiration and Start. My need for something like the Sandwizz\u00ae Breadboard started many years ago. For 32 years in my professional career as an electronic engineer and 10 years before that as an electronics maker, I focused on making things easier and frequently worked on new inventions. My experience taught me the importance of quickly creating mockups to illustrate the concept behind an idea. Drawings, schematics, and 3D CAD models on the computer screen often weren't sufficient to convey ideas to others. Therefore, it became crucial to create something tangible quickly to test and refine the idea. Life has taught me the importance of failing fast and learning by doing. This doesn't mean I don't enjoy studying theory and engaging in deep creative thoughts, but it's only when we try out these theories and ideas that we truly understand them. At the same time, we also discover what's missing in our mindset.",
      "My Summer vacation in Spain 2023. I did enjoy the good food and the nice sun, but my mind was with the Sandwizz Breadboard a lot.",
      "Early Experiments. Between 2015 and 2018, I was involved in developing a new product through an innovation and technological phase in my previous job. It reminded me again of the importance of tools for quick mockup creation, which we partly lacked at that time. In early 2019, while organizing my workshop at home, I found an old yellowed breadboard from my student days and became inspired. Holding this breadboard in one hand and a modern development board in the other, I envisioned the Sandwizz\u00ae Breadboard: a contemporary breadboard with integrated components and intelligence for both analog and digital connections.",
      "The 35-year-old breadboard from my student days. Besides being yellowed, nothing has really changed in breadboards in all that time.",
      "Experimental Mockup. In early 2021, I began researching breadboards that were easier to solder. After some experiments, I ordered a prototype breadboard and built a mockup to illustrate the concept. Even with all the wires that are so typical of a traditional  breadboard mockup, the prototype demonstrated that signals could be effectively routed to specific components and connections.",
      "The first mockup of the Sandwizz Breadboard concept was created using a traditional breadboard, the new solderable breadboard modules, a protoboard, and a couple of evaluation kits for the system-on-chip that I wanted to use. It's a great example of how to use existing tools to create the next generation of a tool in the same category.",
      "Initiating Sandwizz\u00ae Breadboard. After a busy period at work, the idea resurfaced in January 2023. Inspired by what I would have wanted as a young engineer and by the goal of helping the younger generation, the Sandwizz\u00ae Breadboard was developed. I worked many hours after work, creating the first real version of the Sandwizz\u00ae Breadboard. I took a course on Udemy to learn about the KiCad E-CAD software, as I saw it as the perfect choice for a first platform that would be part of the Sandwizz\u00ae concept. Additionally, I wanted to refresh my skills in schematics and PCB layout from my earlier days, as I would need those updated skills to create the Sandwizz\u00ae Breadboard. This way, I also took my own medicine, the one I would prescribe as a first choice for those working with the concept in the future.",

      "Testing the Idea, and Finding a Co-Founder. My close and most trusted colleagues and friends confirmed the value of the idea, and in the summer of 2023, I shared the concept with Ren\u00e9. He immediately recognized its potential and became the co-founder of Microaware\u00ae. Together, we worked hard on the business plan for Microaware, and in late autumn 2023, we signed the agreement for our new joint company. I would work full-time, and Ren\u00e9 would be the advisor in his spare time. We quickly concluded that Kickstarter would be the perfect platform to launch our Sandwizz\u00ae Breadboard concept. It is a platform frequently visited by the younger generation, which is also our target audience, including DIY makers and students. Furthermore, it is an international platform, which Sandwizz\u00ae needs to grow, as the Danish domestic market, although sizable, could easily become too niche-focused for such a product.",
      "Ren\u00e9 and Tommy shake hands after signing the contract to found Microaware.",
      "Business Establishment and Development. Microaware\u00ae was officially established on February 1st, with a hardware release candidate for the Sandwizz\u00ae Breadboard ready for testing. While the product's hardware needed testing for robustness, the firmware was still under development. Throughout the Kickstarter campaign and beyond, we planned to optimize the algorithm for accurate component placement to ensure seamless implementation once the hardware is fully produced.",

      "Presentation and Future Plans. Despite being just a two-person team, our combined experience in business management, innovation, and electronics design has enabled us to create the Sandwizz\u00ae Breadboard from a home office. Even before the official launch of the company, we dedicated countless hours to developing the business and the concept, investing much more time than one might expect for a company that officially began in February 2024. The product was presented at Embedded World 2024 in Nuremberg, where it attracted considerable interest. With Kickstarter, we aim to reach a broader audience that can recognize the potential for more efficient electronics development. We believe that once the right people see the Sandwizz\u00ae Breadboard, they'll appreciate how it can effectively transform ideas into practice.",

      "First smartphone with embedded distributed cloud.Freedom through simplicity, performance and privacy",
      "The next flagship model from Germany is more than an evolution. It is a revolution. It is the world's first smartphone with an integrated, optional cloud that no longer needs a data center. Instead, it is created from networked smartphones\u2014the perfect combination of convenience and security.",
      "Hier geht es zur deutschsprachigen Projektbeschreibung:",
      "The Volla Phone Quintus takes our promise of freedom through simplicity and security to a new level without compromising on hardware. The extra-large display with borderless sides and brilliant brightness and color gamut meets a powerful Dimensity processor and a triple camera with up to native 50 megapixels, packaged in the sleek design and elegant piano lacquer look of a lightweight.",
      "Today's smartphones demand a lot of time and attention. They are designed for this, because time and attention mean more engagement and more usable data for Big Tech. And the evaluation of data enables influence and control. What happens to which data is not determined by the user, especially when smartphones are inextricably linked to iCloud and Google Cloud?",
      "It's time for something new! The Volla Phone Quintus with Volla OS. The Google-free Android enables time and attention for the things that are important to us and self-determination of our data through an intelligent user interface with a refreshingly clear design and unique security features. The concept is simple: the focus is on people and content instead of countless apps and functions.",
      "The Volla Phone Quintus meets the highest demands in terms of features, performance and design, combined with a promise of durability and longevity with long-term system updates.",
      "7 sensors (Light and Proximity, G-sensor, E-Compass, Battery Health, Fingerprint, NFC, Gyroscope)",
      "Lithium-ion polymer battery with rated capacity 4600 mAh and typical capacity 4700 mAh",
      "The Volla Phone 22 is already powerful for all everyday functions. But the Volla Phone Quintus offers a significant improvement:",
      "The Volla Phone Quintus comes with either Volla OS or the mobile Linux distribution Ubuntu Touch. Volla OS is based on the Android Open Source Project and is also open source and published on the popular GitHub platform.",
      "With Android, the wide world of Android apps is open to you. In the Aurora Store, you will find all apps from the Google Play Store that you can install securely and anonymously, while the F-Droid Store offers open-source alternatives for many everyday applications.",
      "And if an app that you need privately or for study and work requires Google Play services, simply activate microG, which simulates the former and establishes the connection to Google services.",
      "The uncluttered Volla Home Screen breathes freedom through simplicity for a clear head. This simplicity is full of possibilities for your everyday life.",
      "The smartphone that understands you.",
      "Start writing, and the Volla Phone Quintus guesses your intention and suggests completion and appropriate actions. Get live weather results or knowledge from Wikipedia. And if you don't have a free hand, simply speak to your Volla Phone Quintus.",
      "Iconographic and powerful at the same time. With a single gesture, you can call up all the important functions of your everyday life via the red dot. Be it the camera, upcoming appointments, your most essential apps and websites, or one of the intelligent content compilations, just as you need it.",
      "Volla OS automatically and dynamically compiles for you your recent contacts with whom you were last in touch by call or message, your recent conversations, whether SMS, Signal, or Volla Messages, your recent messages, your subscribed news channels, or your notes, the most important ones pinned at the top. You can navigate directly to a message or read an exciting article in a streamlined, reader-friendly view without having to open an app. That is the concept of Volla OS. People and content take center stage.",
      "Of course, Volla OS also knows the classic app view, optionally also as the start view. Volla OS can group the apps automatically. The apps that you have used most recently appear first, so you can quickly find what you need if you have a lot of apps installed. Apps can also be grouped by categories, such as games and messengers.",
      "The clean, minimalist design is reflected in the eye-friendly black and white icons and text. Choose between the dark mode for indoors or the fresh mode for outdoor activities, or bring color into your life with the transparent mode with glass effect.",
      "We think artificial intelligence can be useful. But what it does must be transparent; it should not patronize users and certainly not infiltrate their privacy. That's why Volla OS takes a different approach and relies on supportive intelligence that always empowers the user instead of disempowering them.",
      "Not only is the springboard a kind of supportive intelligence, but it also integrates speech recognition and speech synthesis, which also enables accessibility. Maximum security is provided by biometric access blocking of the device through facial recognition. What all these processes have in common is that they are open source, and not a single bit goes into the cloud.",
      "For many users, the appeal of Apple and Google smartphones is not least due to the convenience of iCloud or Google Cloud. However, it's not just emails, images, and videos that are stored in Big Tech's data centers, but also internet activity, movement profiles, and personal contacts that we give away.",
      "They are accessible to the data center operators and evaluated there. In many countries, operators are also obliged to enable monitoring.",
      "The optional Volla Cloud gives the power back to the users. Your data belongs to you. Period. Because the Volla Cloud does not require a data center. Instead, networked Volla Phones form the cloud. You decide with whom you share highly encrypted data.",
      "The Volla Cloud is based on Holochain technology. It is not a blockchain, but rather a technology that adopts the best concepts while overcoming the disadvantages. Holochain uses a chain of transactions that is shared and protects the data from manipulation, but only between trusted peers rather than globally. This makes the system more lightweight and also saves a considerable amount of resources and energy. At the same time, it also enables data to be securely deleted again. This is not possible with a blockchain and inevitably leads to data overflow.",
      "The Volla Cloud forms the foundation for a new ecosystem of apps and services\u2014the perfection of convenience and security. Two basic apps for your everyday life are the start.",
      "With the Volla Messages app, you can connect with contacts with a confirmed identity for 1-to-1 conversations or with multiple contacts. You can also invite people to moderated groups using a passcode. Volla Messages is a WhatsApp, Signal, and Telegram alternative in terms of function. And yet more. Because you don't have to register with your phone number or share your messages via a service in a data center.",
      "Volla Messages is convenient and secure at the same time. After the ability to exchange text messages, images, videos and files, audio and video calls will follow.",
      "The app will also be available for macOS, Windows and dLinux so that you can stay in touch with all your friends and important people in your life.",
      "Back up all the data on your smartphone bit by bit with Recovery. The app is so intelligent that it starts with the most important data, such as your contacts, so that the performance and battery consumption of your Volla Phone Quintus is not affected, and you still gain security quickly.",
      "If your Volla Phone Quintus is lost or damaged, you can restore your data to a new smartphone from the Volla Distributed Cloud. You decide which trusted peers store your distributed and encrypted backup. It could be your family or team or even your own PC. It is also planned to be able to restore data that you have accidentally deleted, or to swap it out if the internal memory is no longer sufficient.",
      "With the Volla Phone Quintus, you decide who you want to share which data with and when. That's why Volla OS is free of Google services. You do not need to open a Volla account for the Volla Phone Quintus.",
      "To create full transparency, we have published the source code of Volla OS. It is based on the Android Open Source project with numerous extensions and replaced, curated system apps that do exactly what they are intended to do.",
      "The Volla Phone Quintus allows you to configure and activate a special operating mode.",
      "Volla OS includes an optional Hide.me virtual private network to protect your Internet connections from third parties who record and analyze your activity, such as your mobile service provider. With worldwide access points, the VPN can even help anonymize your connection.",
      "Hide.me is characterized by a special, particularly secure encryption method and a strict log-free connection. Internet activity is not recorded.",
      "The security features at a glance:",
      "Ubuntu Touch. The mobile Linux alternative for full control",
      "You can choose to get the Volla Phone Quintus with Ubuntu Touch, the mobile version of the popular Linux distribution Ubuntu. This is the perfect choice for anyone who already works with Ubuntu Linux. You will find yourself in the same world, including a sidebar for currently open or frequently used apps.",
      "Ubuntu Touch comes with its own apps store Open Store and basic apps for all important everyday functions from telephony, text messages, photos and much more. Take full control of your smartphone with the Terminal App for en Command Line Interface.",
      "Ubuntu Touch is already prepared for convergence. If you connect a display via Miracast wireless standard as well as a keyboard and mouse, you can use your Volla Phone Quintus like a PC. The new flagship model delivers enough power effortlessly.",
      "Multi Boot for all those who want to be inspired",
      "Volla OS offers the unique possibility to use several operating systems from the same smartphone. The installation of an additional operating system such as Ubuntu Touch is simply the installation of an app. For the first time, this is possible with the Volla Phone Quints on the internal memory, so that the second operating system runs just as smoothly as the first.",
      "Freedom is also freedom of choice. Experience unlimited freedom and try something new. The second operating system is also ideal for anyone who wants to make a strict distinction between private and professional use. Decide which operating system you want to use every time you start your device.",
      "Volla Systeme is an independent German manufacturer of smartphones, tablets and accessories. With 12 suppliers, 7 of them from Germany, and our own production capacities, we are both locally rooted and internationally connected with our employees in many parts of the world.",
      "We have big plans. Nothing less than giving people back their freedom through simplicity and security: free communication, free access to information, and free time and attention for the things that are important to us.",
      "We have been following this path from the very beginning with and for our users, as well as with our friends and partners. This enables us to realize our goals sustainably and offer the best combination of hardware, software, and services for mobile life.",
      "Independent for new paths and your security",
      "In 2017, Dr. J\u00f6rg Wurzer founded Hallo Welt Systeme UG in Remscheid, Germany, which later became Volla Systeme GmbH. To be and remain independent, the entrepreneur relied on his own capital and crowdfunding. After almost 3 years of research & development and a successful Kickstarter campaign, the first Volla Phone was launched in 2020. Since then, over 11,000 smartphones have been sold in over 55 countries worldwide.",
      "Independence from investors allows consistent and long-term protection of privacy and explore completely new paths: away from the focus on apps and dependence on the cloud towards a focus on simplicity and independence from the cloud.",

      "The Multi-Celled Beverage Corporation aims to manufacture the first round of marketable juice boxes",
      "Three ingredient cocktails!  Three kinds of juices for kiddies!  Pierce the rooms at the bottom, blend to desired proportion and drink.   The Multi-Celled Beverage Container\u00ae, patented in more than 100 countries, has a huge potential to breakthru into the global beverage industry.  As the CEO, I hope to raise the necessary money to be able to work with a manufacturing firm in China to bring this innovation to the market.",
      "The Multi-Celled Beverage Container is opening eyes to beverage manufacturers in China, as this never before seen product has quickly garnered attention and is being appraised as a really good idea with a huge long-term market potential.  I have met a liaison to the beverage manufacturers in China who has invited me to China to formally negotiate the innovation with a few manufacturers.   Realistically, as a new machine is needed to build this juice container, I will need to raise a hundred thousand dollars to bridge a business partnership with a willing beverage company.   The Multi-Celled Beverage Corporation needs to invest together with a willing Chinese firm in order to build the final stage filling, closing and sealing juice box machine.   If I am unable to raise such funding, the best I could hope to do is to sell the patent.  The financial backing is required for the MCBC to pay its side of the investment for the adaptation of the machine: and so the cooperation of engineers and managers will be required to adapt the existing tetra-pak juice box delivery system to be able to complete the manufacture of the Multi-Celled Beverage Container.   On top of this, there will be legal fees to pay for.",
      "Here are the stages of Multi-Celled Beverage Container manufacture.  Three of four are already in place:  1) The 500ml Housing Juice Box Container can be created by existing technology.  2) The dual-polyethylene-coated-aluminum sided inner rooms, 200 ml per, each filled with a unique kind of juice, can be created by existing technology.  The dual-aluminum-sided materials can be acquired.  3) The 200 ml rooms will be dipped in peach resin, an odorless, flavorless and edible substance used for healthy skin in China, and then placed by hand into the housing container.  The peach resin will help the rooms stick to the bottom of the container.  It is also possible that a robotic arm be employed to this purpose.  4) Innovation is required to fill the open space above the two rooms at the top of the Housing Container, with a third juice, and then to close and seal the Housing Container that has the two juice rooms already inside it.",
      "The standard between foreign companies in China is a 50/50 investment arrangement and so this is sought between the Multi-Celled Beverage Corporation and a willing corporation.  My wife, from Suzhou, and I, literate in Chinese, have been aggressive in pitching this innovation and are hopeful to meet with the leaders of such beverage manufacturing companies whose interest has been sparked.",
      "As a memento  of gratitude, contributions of 200$ or more will be met with an authentic MCBC t-shirt.   Or, perhaps shares in the potentially lucrative corporation would interest you.",

      "We are a team with a shared goal - a mission to create unique products that stand out to challenge the incumbent tech companies, and to make a worldwide difference with top-notch technology.\n\nWe started our journey in wearables by first launching the world's first payments enabled hybrid smartwatch on Kickstarter.\n\nOur payments feature was live in 28 countries including UK, EU and India.During Covid, we understood the need of the hour and developed India\u2019s first comprehensive health tracker, which measured 5 crucial health vitals including Blood oxygen levels.\n\nDeploying it in multiple hospitals, 1000+ patient beds and saving hundreds of lives with timely alerts for oxygen requirements helped us to truly understand the profound impact technology can have on our lives.\n\nThese experiences came with a couple of important learnings. We realised that the readings from the finger were far more reliable than those from the wrist and that a wrist worn device was not comfortable to wear all night and all day.\n\nThis gave us the idea for Ring One. We married findings from the health tracking with the learnings from payments feature of our first hybrid smartwatch and came up with something which we believe is truly path breaking - the Ring One.",
      "Algorithms Accuracy: Over the past two years, we've dedicated ourselves to perfecting our vital algorithms. We've rigorously tested them on over 4000 individuals, ensuring they meet the highest standards of accuracy and reliability.\n\nContactless Payments Integration: Our experience with launching contactless payments in wearables for the second time puts us in a strong position. We've fine-tuned the process to ensure a smooth, global rollout. However in some countries, all banks might not be integrated from Day 1, but we will bring them on board in a phase wise manner.\n\nManufacturing:  We've forged a strong partnership with a seasoned contract manufacturer with decades of experience in electronic product assembly. Their expertise will help ensure the smooth production of our smart ring.\n\n While we launch our campaign with confidence, we remain vigilant. We've taken steps to identify potential challenges and have strategies in place to address them swiftly. Our commitment to transparency means you'll always be informed of our progress and any challenges we face.",

      "So a premium pillow is not really a luxury as it plays an important role in your sleep. Why don't you get a fantastic pillow which can help relieve your sore muscles after work? And how much are you willing to pay for a sound sleep?",

      "Hi, Kickstarters! We've been standing by too long, watching ideas get exhibited, projects funded, and miracles created. We're excited to unveil our latest creation: JOAT - the ultimate multifunction titanium EDC tool. Meticulously designed with passion and expertise, this compact tool is crafted from grade 5 titanium, and it guarantees durability for your daily adventures. Boasting over six features seamlessly integrated into its sleek design, the JOAT ensures you're equipped for any situation\u2014 Jack of all trades, master of them all.",
      "Whether you are a minimalist who loves to carry as simple as possible or a survival guy who prefers to get prepared all the time, you'll love this compact and mighty multitool designed for the broadest range of uses.",
      "1X JOAT= 6 General Utility Tools",
      "As office workers who love all kinds of outdoor activities, we need a tool that addresses the common challenge of carrying multiple gadgets, and we believe you do, too. More importantly, it must be legit to carry anywhere we go. So, we combined various functions into a modular sandwich-structured tool that streamlines daily life, eliminating the need for bulky items. Small but mighty, JOAT is the magic in the pocket that enhances efficiency and convenience.",
      "Joat is crafted by CNC machining from grade 5 titanium material. These two factors are just the guarantee of the quality of the finished product. The repeated tests ensure the degree of completion of the design. What's shown here are the results of our original design effort, quality materials, CNC machining techniques, and patience poured into this one unit. It's resistant to almost everything you'll see in common: rust, corrosion, acid, and base; they are nothing challenging at all.",
      "Built-in Mini Knife with Scalpel Blade",
      "How often do you find yourself in need of a knife to open a box, cut ropes, sharpen a pencil, remove labels from a new cloth, etc? But it is not always legitimate to bring your folding knives everywhere. With the JOAT, you don't have to worry about it. The built-in knife uses a super sharp mini scalpel blade. You may not be able to cook a meal with it, but other than that, it covers 80% of knife-related usage on ordinary days.",
      "The quick-release blade holder design allows you to change the blades in just less than one second. You can simply remove the blade if you are taking a flight or going somewhere the security is tight.",
      "When the blade gets dull and stained, pull out the blade and insert a brand-new one. Then you get a super sharp scalpel knife that is as good as new.",
      "Is the screw loose, and the machine is making a strange noise? Good! We've got you covered. And don't worry about dropping your bits at all. Four strong magnets and the cover plates won't let that happen.",
      "Screws, nuts, and bolts, not one less. You'll need a small handy wrench to deal with them for gripping, fastening, turning, tightening, and loosening things like pipe fittings, nuts, and bolts. Please don't underestimate the strength of the wrench due to its shape. For nuts on tripods, bicycles, etc, use it however you want, and you won't have any problems.",
      "How about a drink after a day of heavy work? You don't drink beer very often, but it doesn't harm to have one in case you need it some time. If you see someone in need of it, it may be so much better to take your JOAT out than ask, why bring a drink but not a bottle opener? It's a great conversation starter, too.",
      "But even if you are not an enthusiast, having a small pry bar/ nail remover on your keychains can be very useful.",
      "Why is it so different from any other multitools?",
      "---- The pleasure of FULLY disassembling every part by yourself",
      "It gives you the most freedom to proceed or step back. If you want it all, it's a compact, versatile multitool that does it all. In those days, you want nothing outside of you except for your keys; you can break it down entirely to a quality shackle to which you can attach all your keys.",
      "JOAT utilizes titanium, ensuring exceptional durability and longevity. The stonewashed and bead blast finish stands the test of time. The smooth finish also reduces the need for frequent replacements. Just like us, JOAT promotes a more eco-friendly lifestyle. All you need to replace is the blade that gets dull after you use it without any hesitation.",
      "Are you taking your JOAT on a flight with you? Not a problem! Despite the sharp blade and the complex components, it's TSA-compliant. Just smoothly pull the blade off, discard it, and keep the handle with you; you are good to go. It's no doubt the perfect travel companion for all your creative needs. The new blades are accessible everywhere, and you can also get a 10X pack here. It's available as an add-on.",
      "We are excited to offer free worldwide shipping to all our backers. With this perk, you can have your Bolt-action Pen delivered to your doorstep without any extra charges. We aim to provide a seamless and hassle-free experience, allowing you to fully enjoy your Bolt-action Pen without incurring additional costs.",
      "The tritium tube groove is very suitable for decoration and also for quick positioning of knives/keychains in the dark. Okay, we offer two instead of one.\nThe tritium tube is placed on both sides of the shackle (marked in red). We added them to Shackle because they always exist and tools can be removed at any time no matter what happens. So you can always see tritium tubes on JOAT tools.",
      "2.You may also notice that the connection of the titanium plate has changed from upward to a side opening with wire cut springs. Therefore, even if you jump or swing the tool very hard (even on a centrifuge, LOL), the tool will remain in place.",

Another thought was, if we could put the heads-up display inside the glasses instead of protruding outside as on Google Glass, we would get a better looking smart glass and it may help to make it prevail.",

These are not all of them, we didn't keep them in the early days.

      "On electronic side, we modulized the boards based on functionality so that we can change part of the hardware without impacting other parts of the system; even so, we had gone through over 20 iterations; the highly modulized mainboard of the mini-computer went through 5 iterations. Here are some recent versions of FPCs we produced:",

      "As to working prototype, the first time that we made it work in an eyewear form was in 2017. We had discussed of launching it on Kickstarter but didn't take that direction. We knew that something wasn't up to our expectations yet; plus, we had been bitten many times when we tried to take a shortcut in the past, we got a deep understanding of slow is smooth, smooth is fast, and prefer to do it step by step, pay attention to each little detail without bold assumptions. Eventually our hard work paid off, Norm Glasses won CES 2019 Innovation Award, and German Innovation Award recently.",
      "We are ready to mass produce Norm Glasses. The funds raised on Kickstarter would enable us to order electronic and optical components in large quantities with volume discounts, thus making it possible to bring Norm Glasses to everyone with relatively affordable price. It will also help to accelerate software development and bring the product to everyone quicker.",

    "company_name": "Jing Che",
    "allParagraphs": [
      "Personal Comfort | Focus Booster | Real-time Muscle Recovery | Lightweight | Easy-to-use",
      "It all starts from a typical humid summer evening in Singapore. In our air-conditioned room, my daughter was sweating uncomfortably, while my mother felt the chill. The tension peaked as my wife presented the latest electricity bill with soaring energy costs. It was this all-too-common scenario that sparked a realization: we needed a solution that could offer personalized cooling without contributing to excessive energy consumption. Thus, the Silent Cicada was born, embodying the belief that \"Comfort is Personal.\" Echoing Elon Musk's sentiment, \"Personalization is the future,\" we're set to redefine the air conditioning landscape, much like Steve Jobs transformed the personal computer industry.",
      "We invite you to join our journey on Indiegogo, not just for exclusive perks but to be part of a movement enhancing comfort with sustainability in mind.",
      "Additional power units are also available, allowing you to switch batteries as one runs out and ensuring uninterrupted cooling. With a charging time that's shorter than the usage time per charge, you can use one battery while the other charges. This way, as soon as one battery depletes, a fully charged one is ready to replace it.",
      "Operating the device is straightforward: simply secure the cooling unit around your wrist, snap on the power unit, and you're ready to experience the cooling effect. For a more comprehensive guide, please refer to the video below:",
      "Compared to traditional air conditioners, our Silent Cicada Personal Aircon offers superior portability as a compact, lightweight device that can be worn on the wrist for on-the-go cooling. It boasts significant advantages including lower costs, zero maintenance, reduced power consumption, and enhanced mobility.",
      "Many wearable cooling devices on the market are either cumbersome or pose significant risks, such as being too close to vital organs or difficult to monitor, potentially reducing the window for emergency action. In contrast, our Personal Aircon outperforms these alternatives without question, offering both safety and convenience.",
      "Showcase of Effectiveness 1: Personal Aircon rapidly cools, producing condensation on the surface of an acrylic tube in just 3 minutes (time-lapse video).",
      "The Silent Cicada Personal Air Conditioner operates on several key cooling principles designed to enhance personal comfort without altering the body's core temperature significantly:",
      "1. Enhanced cooling sensation: Aligning with the body's thermoregulation, Silent Cicada targets thermoreceptor-rich areas such as the wrists for precise cooling. It focuses on enhancing the cooling sensation rather than reducing the core temperature, adhering to the body's natural temperature control mechanisms.",
      "Effectiveness Showcase 2: Watch Personal Aircon swiftly cool a user's arm from 97\u00b0F (36 \u00b0C)to 93\u00b0F (34\u00b0C) in just 3 minutes, as captured by an infrared camera (time-lapse video).",
      "2. Heat Relief Activation: By stimulating natural heat relief processes and arteriovenous anastomoses (AVAs) in areas prone to efficient cooling like palms and wrists, and integrating Traditional Chinese Medicine practices by activating the \"Waiguan\" acupuncture point, the device efficiently dissipates heat.",
      "In essence, the Silent Cicada Personal Air Conditioner provides a nuanced and scientifically informed approach to personal cooling, prioritizing safety, effectiveness, and the enhancement of the body's natural cooling responses.",
      "We conducted a BLIND test to evaluate the ambient temperature perception using both functional (FD) and non-functional (NFD) Silent Cicada personal air conditioner. Participants recorded their perceived room temperature after stabilizing for 5 minutes, then swapped devices and repeated the process. On average, the Personal Aircon effectively reduces the perceived temperature by 3.6\u00b0F (2\u00b0C ) for users.",
      "In a separate study, we assessed Silent Cicada\u2019s impact on office thermal comfort using Berkeley's survey format, with 24 volunteers, ages 18-63, evenly divided by gender. Based on the survey results, more participants preferred the 82\u00b0F (28\u00b0C) setting with Silent Cicada over the standard 79\u00b0F (26\u00b0C) setting, with women reporting higher satisfaction, indicating gender-specific thermal preferences.",
      "These experiments underscore Silent Cicada\u2019s role in enhancing thermal comfort and workplace productivity while suggesting potential for energy conservation and environmental benefits by enabling higher indoor temperature settings comfortably. By simple calculations, our Personal Aircon offers a daily saving of S$2.10 and a reduction in carbon emissions of about 2.57 kg.",
      "Lowering muscle temperature is key to reducing muscle fatigue and boosting athletic performance. Cold water immersion helps alleviate post-exercise stiffness, but preventing muscle fatigue during activities remains a challenge. The Silent Cicada Personal Aircon could be a solution by effectively delaying muscle overheating during exercise. This allows athletes to enhance performance by managing heat accumulation in real-time, ensuring peak efficiency throughout their activities.",
      "10 Volunteers, Ages 12-40, conducted test activities including running (distance covered in 2 minutes), dumbbell lifting (number of times a 2.5KG dumbbell was lifted), and hand gripping (number of times a 2KGF grip was achieved), with and without Personal Aircon.",
      "Findings: Utilizing the Silent Cicada Personal Aircon led to improved exercise performance, with a 2% increase in 2-minute running distance, 19% more dumbbell lifts, and a 17% boost in grip endurance. These results indicate the device's potential to enhance resistance training by positively impacting fatigue response, especially when positioned closer to the target muscle group.",
      "Recent studies have shed light on a crucial yet often overlooked factor affecting the learning environment: temperature. These studies reveal that for every 1\u00b0F increase in temperature over the course of a school year, there's a corresponding 1% decrease in the amount learned.",
      "100 volunteers, aged 18 to 25, played a maze game of the same difficulty level twice; once with a non-functional device and again with a functional Silent Cicada device, without knowing which was which (blind test). Based on the statistics, the Personal Aircon notably enhanced focus, improving test performance by an average of 5.2% faster. 70% of participants experienced a speed increase, with the most significant improvement at 25.3%.",
      "Additionally, 10 volunteers, aged 18 to 25, solved 50 math questions of Primary 3 level twice, under the same conditions as the previous test, including the blind test format with non-functional and functional devices. Surprisingly, 80% of the participants showed faster completion times, with all participants either improving or maintaining their accuracy on the questions when using the Personal Aircon.",
      "These results indicate that the Silent Cicada can significantly boost focus and efficiency in academic or work environments, offering substantial benefits to those who find it challenging to sustain concentration. Although the Silent Cicada does not directly enhance IQ, our research suggests it may significantly contribute to higher test scores.",
      "Our cutting-edge Personal Aircon is at the forefront of personal cooling technology, with patents granted in some countries and a crucial patent pending in the USA. This highlights our commitment to innovation and protecting our unique technology on a global scale.",
      "FCC compliance refers to the adherence to regulations set forth by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the United States. It ensures our Personal aricon  meeting health and safety standards related to electromagnetic exposure.",
      "Currently, our pilot production lines are operational. The casings have been 3D printed, and both the PCBs and batteries have been manufactured. We anticipate that the first batch of products for early backers will be completed by mid-May and ready for shipping at the campaign's conclusion.",
      "Our Personal Aircon offers flexible cooling beyond its main function, however, caution is advised for those with health conditions such as high blood pressure or cardiovascular diseases. Applying cooling near the neck may interfere with natural temperature regulation, potentially causing discomfort. Overcooling can lead to increased calorie burning, risking symptoms like dizziness. Discontinue use if discomfort arises. Our aim is safe, enjoyable personal cooling, considering health and well-being.",

      "Hi, I\u2019m Jony, founder of Omni Health.",
      "A few years ago, I was a software engineer in Silicon Valley\u2014long hours, junk food, and little sleep were my norm. It wasn\u2019t until a routine health check flagged high uric acid and other warning signs that I had to pause and rethink: What\u2019s the point of success if I\u2019m too unhealthy to enjoy it?",
      "I tried everything\u2014fitness trackers, health apps, different diets\u2014but nothing stuck. Most wearables just collected data without real guidance. Coincidentally, my expertise was in time-series data insights, the same type of data our bodies generate daily. I realized that beneath those raw numbers lay valuable health patterns\u2014ones that could drive real change if interpreted correctly.",
      "At the same time, a few close friends with backgrounds in psychology and health management shared the same frustration. We came together with a vision: to create a seamless, science-backed way to build better health habits. That\u2019s how Omni Health was born.",
      "For the past two years, we\u2019ve been perfecting the Omni Health Ring\u2014an ultra-thin, ultra-narrow, and ultra-light smart ring designed for all-day comfort. Why? Because long-term, continuous tracking is what truly matters. But unlike typical wearables, this isn\u2019t just about monitoring. We combined advanced sensor data, AI-driven insights, and behavioral science techniques to offer personalized, actionable health strategies that actually fit into your daily life.",
      "Our hardware and core AI algorithms are fully developed, and we've run successful early tests. Now, we need your support to bring this innovation to more people. Your backing will help us:",
      "\u2705 Mass-produce the ring so more people can benefit\n\u2705 Enhance our AI+CBT system through continuous software updates\n\u2705 Expand into more health areas, from sleep and stress management to weight loss and metabolic health",

Why couldn't we have an office that would unfold from a suitcase?",

This need led to the creation of Base Case\u2014the solution that allows us to transport easily, deploy in under 30 seconds, and get working\u2014anywhere.",

Whether it\u2019s an unexpected backlog, bad timing with holidays, or a quality assurance issue on the ground floor, we\u2019ll let you know immediately. Our #1 priority is product quality followed by timely delivery.",
      "FULFILLMENT: Sometimes, stuff happens that can\u2019t be planned for: a supplier misses a deadline, a package gets held up at customs, a shipment gets lost, or a global pandemic shuts down shipping ports around the world. Those things can cause delays. We are using an experienced logistics team to get our products to you.

      "BOOK A MEETING WITH ME",
      "CHECK OUT MY MUSIC",
      "CHECK OUT MY LINKEDIN",
      "I have made a decision. Things are going to change for the better. I am done with living in scarcity, working my ass off and finding it is not working. I am done with having to scrape by, being constantly busy, and still not having enough.",
      "That\u2019s why I have started this crowdfunding. To get financially healthy. But as the project is evolving, it\u2019s becoming much more: A way to reconnect with the ones I love, a way to build a sustainable future for myself beyond the crowdfunding, and a way for me to take back control and realise my dreams.",
      "I am asking you, my family, friends, and network, to help me:",
      "By reconnecting. Just talking already means a lot to me. I love getting feedback on what I am doing, as two know more than one",
      "By sharing my crowdfunding. Really taking some time to check out what I can do and share this crowdfunding with people you know who will benefit from my skills. Connect directly with them and talk about these opportunities.",
      "By sharing the crowdfunding in groups and on social media.",
      "By getting one of my products directly and working on a project together.",
      "Three years ago, I left my safe and steady PR job for a freelance career and ever since, I have been struggling to make ends meet. It turns out freelancing is a lot more challenging for me than I thought and although work has been coming in and I am busy all the time, I still miss the consistency necessary to really stay out of trouble.",
      "At the moment, I have four great projects that I am working on with a lot of potential, but they just won\u2019t materialise fast enough.",
      "I am working in regenerative business on lead generation with my business partner, Sajni, for our company called Kholo. We specialise in building organisations that actually take care of their employees instead of their bottom line, which is actually good for their bottom line in the long run. We help organisations like Cambridge to take the next step.",
      "I am working for a good friend who is building a change agency called Capacit\u00b3y, helping companies prepare for growth internally and implementing the most effective growth strategies to reach their goals. Also in a regenerative fashion.",
      "I am working with a PR software company called PR.co to build a workshop and consultancy service to help companies tell their story effectively to the right audience and make the most out of the software they make.",
      "And in music, I am working for a Web3 music streaming service called TraXs, built by SmartLabel in the Netherlands. They are putting the artist first while building amazing products that will change how we listen and appreciate music.",
      "The overarching theme here is that all of these projects have amazing potential, but none of them are making enough money at the moment. This will come at some point. Just not now.",
      "I can\u2019t just sit around and wait for them to start making money. I am taking control over my situation, and that\u2019s why you\u2019re reading this story. Why I started this project. And why I need your help.",
      "Normally, crowdfunding is to gather a big group of people to give a small sum of money and it\u2019s a way to fund projects. And yes, that\u2019s the case here too, but it is so much more than that. Besides the financial side, it\u2019s a way for me to reconnect to you, the people I love, and meet new people. It\u2019s a way to tell everyone that I am in (financial) trouble and I am asking for help to get out of it.",
      "Since I started the project and sent out the first email to friends and family, I have had countless conversations and responses. Because I don\u2019t just want to ask for money. I want to show everyone how I am doing and be fully transparent in sharing my story. And the responses have been heartwarming! I have already received backing from people I haven\u2019t talked to in a long time and I had amazing feedback. I am deeply touched by that.",
      "So this is not your average crowdfunding; it\u2019s a way to connect with friends and family and feel the warmth and strength of the community I have built throughout the years. Through living in Portugal and meeting friends here, through my music, through the projects I have done, and all the other ways I have struck a chord with.",
      "Another way this is not your average crowdfunding is that this is a lead generator. I have a massive network of amazing people who have their own network, unleashing huge potential that up until now I had no idea how to tap into. Taking a few minutes to share this crowdfunding on your socials helps. Attentively sharing what I can do with the right people in your network can prove the difference between struggling and an abundance of opportunities. When we jump on a call, we can really dig deep on what\u2019s possible and I am happy to help you identify who those people are in your network that need what I can offer.",
      "When we are constantly on the verge of not having money, that stresses us out. And when we experience stress, that messes with the brain\u2019s capacity to think clearly. That\u2019s why poor people make questionable decisions with money. Not because they are stupid and deserve to be poor, but because their situation doesn\u2019t allow them to think clearly enough and so they end up in a downward spiral.",
      "That\u2019s me at the start of this project.",
      "So first of all, the money will relieve the stress and give me peace of mind to think more clearly and being more effective in everything I do. Second, I need to pay off debt with loved ones around me and tax and social security payment backlogs. It\u2019s over \u20ac20k at the moment. And then, I am finally able to invest in myself and my dreams.",
      "The truth for me is that I don\u2019t need to pay my debts and can get around without having the money I need to stay afloat every month. I am doing great at the moment, but, over time, I have been slowly, almost unnoticeably, drowning by neglecting some of my less essential needs, hoping the tax collector won\u2019t come to hard on me, and cutting deals and corners where I can, sometimes with devastating impact on my mental health, making me struggle even more. Yes, the spiral is vicious.",
      "When the crowdfunding starts rolling, the most important debts are paid, and I can finally take a breather again after three years, I\u2019ll be focusing on taking good care of myself and building my dreams.",
      "Music is my first love and I have been tinkering with it since I was a little kid. Music has always been a means to meet people and travel. I started the band last year and it\u2019s time to invest in my music and take my endeavours to the next level. I have eight people in the band now who are eager to build with me. Having money will remove the boundaries that I set for myself and will enable me to spread more music while being able to push harder and take more risks.",
      "Secondly, I want to invest in regenerative business. This is the way to build a better future for everyone on this planet. My business partner Sajni put me on this path and together, I plan to follow it through until the end. Having money will give me peace of mind and time to build the company mindfully and find the most effective ways to make businesses more regenerative.",
      "Thirdly, I am looking forward to seeing what I am capable of when I am not constantly limiting myself financially and having to scrape by. When I don\u2019t have to rethink every euro I spend because there is abundance and to see how it opens up my mind when the financial stress dies down. When I can take proper care of myself and not just cover the basics. To see the actual potential within me come out and to be able to share that with the people around me.",
      "A beautiful by-product of this crowdfunding is a sort of formalisation of my community, a tangible overview of the people I love and who care about me. Because this won\u2019t end. Ever. This will go on indefinitely. Long past reaching my funding goal. This will be a growing community that I will keep up-to-date with my newsletter, where I\u2019ll share how this project evolves over time to celebrate the wins, share the setbacks, and become a hub that will enable me to share and help others.",
      "You\u2019re investing in me, obviously, but you\u2019re also investing in a philosophy. A future that is more human-centric, that focuses on trust, and connectedness through the art of regenerative business.",
      "What does this mean?",
      "Everything I do, I approach with the view that everything is interconnected and part of a bigger system, something that should contribute to the well-being of people, communities, and the planet. My work is grounded in principles of regeneration: fostering cultures of purpose, adaptability, and care for each other and what we do and leaving things better than we find them. Where systems are put in place that don\u2019t deplete resources but actually grow and make them better over time.",
      "I support teams in becoming more regenerative by making them more self-managed, connected, and aligned with their deeper purpose, so the business itself becomes a force for personal growth and starts spreading positive energy. When the people in an organisation thrive, the organisation can\u2019t do anything other than thrive itself too.",
      "And so all the products I sell are infused with this idea and no matter what we do together, you\u2019ll get a healthy dose of regenerative business energy to take your endeavours to the next level.",
      "The best way to support the project is to directly buy one of the products here on the right. That immediately brings in money and gives us a clear direction on how to work together. The sooner the better, as you\u2019ll be in front of the queue when it comes to realising the project.",
      "Also, by jumping on a call with me. Use this link to set up an hour meeting, or call me directly, and I\u2019ll tell you all about the campaign. You\u2019ll get the full lowdown on how I am doing, how the project is going, and we get a chance to see each other, to hear how you are doing. To connect. To help each other. As much as we can.",
      "Lastly, by taking the time to understand the products that I can offer and giving some thought to who in your network would greatly benefit from my services. I know we\u2019re all very busy but giving this your undivided attention and sharing this with, say, three people in your network, can make all the difference.",
      "With music, for instance, I am looking for people who organise music events and need DJs and people who manage artists to take the next step. An introduction would be amazing!",
      "When you buy a product. We\u2019ll have a call or meet in person, where possible. Again, this is all about connection. We align expectations and make sure we are both happy with where it\u2019s heading and, ultimately, the results. I am committed to making this a success and clear communication is key. Once a product is confirmed, it will enter a pipeline to track progress and to make sure nothing falls through the cracks. If at any point you have questions, reach out to me at info@guyvankoolwijk.nl",
      "Also, you see companies added to products. These are companies of close friends that have the knowledge and infrastructure to scale up these products or support products in various ways. I lean on them as a network of professionals, so when I may run into my limits, that doesn\u2019t mean that projects have to wait for me to continue going and grow.",
      "NEDERLANDSE TEKST",
      "Ik heb een beslissing genomen. Er moet iets veranderen. Ik ben klaar met niet genoeg geld hebben, met mezelf kapotwerken en er achter komen dat ik toch niet genoeg heb om rond te komen. Ik ben het zat om altijd druk te zijn en toch langzaam weg te zakken in schulden.",
      "Daarom ben ik deze crowdfunding gestart. Om weer financieel gezond te worden. Maar wat begonnen is als een crowdfunding ontwikkelt zich in iets dat veel groter is dan dat: een manier om de banden aan te halen met de mensen van wie ik hou, een manier om een duurzame toekomst voor mezelf op te bouwen na de crowdfunding, een manier om grip te krijgen op mijn leven en mijn dromen te verwezelijken.",
      "Ik vraag jou, mijn familie, vrienden en iedereen in mijn netwerk om me te helpen:",
      "Door een keer goed bij te praten. Dat is me al heel waardevol. Ik ben benieuwd hoe het met je gaat en naar je feedback.",
      "Door deze crowdfunding te delen en echt even de de tijd te nemen om goed te begrijpen hoe ik anderen kan helpen en dit te delen met de meest relevante mensen. Neem contact met ze op en bespreek wat mogelijk is.",
      "Door de crowdfunding te delen in groepen en op sociale media.",
      "Door direct een product van mij af te nemen en samen een project te starten.",
      "Drie jaar geleden heb ik mijn veilige PR-baan opgezegd om als freelancer aan de slag te gaan en sindsdien is het strijden om rond te komen. Freelancen blijkt voor mij een stuk uitdagender dan gedacht. Hoewel ik genoeg werk heb en ik constant bezig ben, mis ik de consistentie die nodig is om echt uit de financi\u00eble problemen te blijven.",
      "Op dit moment ben ik betrokoken bij vier geweldige projecten met ontzettend veel potentie waar ik echt in geloof, maar er komt gewoon nog niet genoeg geld van binnen:",
      "Ik doe een project samen met mijn zakenpartner Sajni en haar bedrijf Kholo waarbij we organisaties zoals Cambridge helpen zich meer regeneratief te organiseren (ik vertel verderop wat dit inhoud). Waarbij ze de werknemers centraal stellen, niet de winst. Iets dat op lange termijn juist weer goed is voor de winst. En de planeet.",
      "Ik werk voor een goede vriend die een change agency aan het bouwen is. We helpen bedrijven zich intern voor te bereiden op groei en de juiste strategie\u00ebn te implementeren om die groeien te realiseren. Ook dit met een regeneratieve aanpak.",
      "Ik werk samen met het PR-softwarebedrijf PR.co om hun klanten te helpen met workshops en consultancy zodat die hun verhaal beter kunnen vertellen aan het juiste publiek.",
      "In de muziek werk ik voor Web3 muziekstreamingdienst TraXs, gebouwd door SmartLabel in Nederland. Ze zetten de artiest voorop en bouwen producten die onze manier van muziek luisteren fundamenteel zullen veranderen.",
      "De rode draad: al deze projecten hebben enorm veel potentie, maar leveren op dit moment nog niet genoeg op. Dat komt zeker. Maar nu nog niet.",
      "En nu ben ik op een punt gekomen dat ik niet kan blijven wachten tot een van deze projecten geld op gaat leveren. Ik moet het heft in eigen handen nemen. Daarom lees je dit verhaal. Daarom ben ik dit project begonnen. Daarom heb ik jouw hulp nodig.",
      "Normaal gesproken is crowdfunding een manier om veel mensen een klein bedrag te laten doneren om een project te financieren. Dat is hier ook zo, maar het is veel meer dan dat. Naast de financi\u00eble kant is dit namelijk een manier voor mij om de banden aan te halen met jou \u2014 met de mensen van wie ik hou \u2014 en om nieuwe mensen te ontmoeten. Het is een manier om openlijk te zeggen dat ik in de (financi\u00eble) problemen zit en hulp nodig heb.",
      "Sinds ik het project ben gestart en de eerste mail eruit gedaan heb naar vrienden en familie om het project uit te leggen, heb ik veel gesprekken en reacties gehad. Ik vraag namelijk niet zomaar om geld. Ik wil laten zien hoe het echt met me gaat en volledig transparant zijn over waarom ik dit doe. En de reacties zijn hartverwarmend. Ik heb de eerste producten al verkocht aan mensen met wie ik niet heel vaak contact heb en ik krijg geweldige feedback. Dat raakt me diep.",
      "Dit is dus niet zomaar een crowdfunding. Het is een manier om de kracht en warmte te voelen van de gemeenschap die ik door de jaren heen heb opgebouwd, in Nederland, in Portugal, met de muziek, met de projecten die ik heb gedaan en op alle andere manieren waarop ik mensen heb geraakt.",
      "Een ander groot verschil is dat dit ook een manier is om nieuw werk te vinden. Ik heb een enorm netwerk van geweldige mensen, die op hun beurt weer hun eigen netwerk hebben. Dat is een bron waar ik tot nu toe niet precies van wist hoe ik die kon inzetten.",
      "Als je een paar minuten de tijd neemt om dit project op je socials te delen helpt al enorm. Dit project gericht delen met mensen in jouw netwerk kan het verschil maken tussen nauwelijks overleven of een overvloed aan werk. Laten we bellen en samen uitzoeken wie in jouw netwerk echt iets aan mijn diensten heeft.",
      "Constant net niet genoeg geld hebben is ontzettend stressvol. En stress vermindert ons vermogen om helder na te denken. Daarom maken mensen met weinig geld soms twijfelachtige financi\u00eble beslissingen. Niet omdat ze dom zijn, maar omdat hun situatie hen mentaal uitput en ze simpelweg de gevolgen niet goed kunnen overzien.",
      "Dat ben ik. Aan het begin van dit project.",
      "Het geld is dus als eerste bedoelt om stress weg te nemen en me ruimte te geven om helder na te kunnen denken en effectiever te handelen. Daarnaast wil ik zo snel mogelijk mijn schulden aflossen. Dat bedrag ligt nu net boven de \u20ac20.000 en dat vreet me op. Als daar schot in zit kan ik eindelijk investeren in mezelf en in mijn dromen.",
      "De harde waarheid is dat ik al een tijd langzaam, bijna onmerkbaar, aan het verdrinken ben in schulden. Het gaat op dit moment heel goed met me, maar door telkens wat minder voor mezelf te zorgen, te hopen dat de belastingdienst me lang genoeg met rust laat en links en rechts dealtjes te sluiten die soms verkeerd lopen met grote impact op mijn mentale gezondheid. Het is niet fijn.",
      "Zodra de crowdfunding op gang komt, de belangrijkste schulden zijn afgelost en ik na drie jaar eindelijk op adem kan komen, gaat de focus naar mezelf en mijn dromen.",
      "Muziek is de rode draad in mijn leven. Van jongs af aan ben ik er al druk mee. Muziek zorgt ervoor dat ik mensen leer kennen en Europa afreis. Vorig jaar is daar de band bijgekomen en het is nu tijd om te investeren en mijn muziek naar een hoger niveau te tillen. De band staat klaar om mee te bouwen. Met geld verdwijnen de beperkingen die ik mezelf opgelegd heb en kan ik harder groeien door meer risico te nemen.",
      "Daarnaast wil ik investeren in regeneratief ondernemen. Dit is de weg vooruit naar een mooiere samenleving. Mijn zakenpartner Sajni heeft me de ogen geopend en ik ben super gemotiveerd om hier verder in te groeien. Met geld heb ik de rust om de tijd te nemen om ons bedrijf zorgvuldig verder op te bouwen.",
      "Tot slot ben ik benieuwd wat ik kan bereiken als ik mezelf niet langer financieel hoef te beperken. Als ik niet elk dubbeltje hoef om te draaien en er meer mentale ruimte ontstaat. Dan kan ik echt goed voor mezelf zorgen en niet alleen de basis dekken. Dan kan mijn ware potentieel naar boven komen. Iets wat ik graag met iedereen wil ik delen.",
      "Een mooi bijproduct van deze crowdfunding is een soort formele bevestiging van mijn community. Een tastbaar overzicht van de belangrijkste mensen in mijn leven. Want dit stopt niet als de funding binnen is. Dit blijft groeien en blijf iedereen op de hoogte houden via mijn nieuwsbrief, waarin ik de ontwikkelingen zal blijven delen \u2014 successen, tegenslagen en alles daartussen.",
      "In mij, uiteraard. Maar ook in een filosofie. In een toekomst die menselijker is, gebouwd op vertrouwen en verbondenheid, mogelijk gemaakt door de idee\u00ebn achter regeneratief ondernemen.",
      "Wat houdt dit in?",
      "Alles wat ik doe zie ik als onderdeel van een groter geheel dat invloed heeft op wat we doen. De verhalen die ik vertel met PR bijvoorbeeld zijn onderdeel van een groter geheel dat die verhalen weer be\u00efnvloed. Werk moet bijdragen aan het welzijn van mensen en de omgeving. Mijn werk is daarmee gebaseerd op principes van regeneratie: projecten moeten energie geven, de samenwerking moet meer opleveren dan afzonderlijk bewerkstelligd zou kunnen worden, culturen cre\u00ebren die echt een doel hebben, zich moeiteloos aan passen en zorgzaam zijn voor hun omgeving. Dingen beter achterlaten dan we ze gevonden hebben. Systemen ontwerpen die niet kaalroven, maar alles juist laten groeien.",
      "Ik help teams regeneratiever te worden door autonomie te stimuleren, connectie tussen mensen te vergroten en ze in contact te brengen met hun persoonlijke diepere motivaties. Dan wordt een bedrijf een plek voor persoonlijke groei. En als het met de mensen goed gaat, volgen bedrijven vanzelf.",
      "Dus alles wat ik aanbied is doordrenkt met deze visie. Wat we ook samen doen, je krijgt een flinke dosis goede, regeneratieve, energie mee.",
      "De beste manier om het project te steunen is door direct een product hier rechts af te nemen. Dat levert me direct geld op en geeft ons richting voor een mooi project. Wees er snel bij want als de rij langer wordt sta je niet achteraan.",
      "Daarnaast: Laten we bellen. Gebruik deze link om een uur in mijn kalender vrij te maken of bel me direct. Dan vertel ik je alles over dit project, hoe het met me gaat en ik kan horen hoe het met jou gaat. Zodat we de banden aanhalen en elkaar kunnen helpen.",
      "Tot slot waardeer ik het enorm als je tijd neemt om mijn producten goed te bekijken en nadenkt over wie in jouw netwerk met me zou willen samenwerken. We zijn allemaal druk, maar als je hier je aandacht aan geeft en dit met bijvoorbeeld drie mensen deelt, kan dat al alles veranderen.",
      "Met muziek bijvoorbeeld zou je me waanzinnig helpen als je me kan introduceren aan boekers en promoters van muziek festivals en venues. Ik ben ook op zoek naar artiesten managers om te spreken en te kijken hoe ik de band en Space Kadett naar een hoger plan kan tillen.",
      "Als je een product koopt beginnen we met een goed gesprek. Verbinding staat centraal. We stemmen de verwachtingen goed af en zorgen ervoor dat we allebei blij zijn met de richting en het beoogde resultaat. Ik ben vastberaden dit tot een succes te maken en heldere communicatie is daarbij cruciaal. Zodra een product is bevestigd komt het in mijn systeem te staan om voortgang te volgen en niets over het hoofd te zien.",
      "Heb je vragen? Mail me gerust op info@guyvankoolwijk.nl.",
      "Bij sommige producten staan bedrijven vermeld. Dit zijn bedrijven van goede vrienden met de kennis en infrastructuur om deze producten op te schalen of op andere manieren te ondersteunen. Ik leun op dit professionele netwerk, zodat projecten kunnen doorgroeien, ook als ik tegen mijn grenzen aanloop.",

      "The Softest, Most Durable, Ultra Absorbent Towels featuring our XPLORE 11\u00ae Technology Blend.",
      "We re-examined every aspect of the towel, pushing the boundaries of what your towel can do for you. Your towel does more than just dry fast, it should also be absorbent, durable, and soft against your skin. A poorly constructed towel will cause it to stretch, lose its threads, and potentially tear overuse.",
      "A good towel is not just about the material, but also about the construction and production process.",
      "You don't know it yet, but we're your new favorite towel, ready to use every single day!",
      "Every single towel we've made has been engineered from the fiber level up. That means research to understand how your body reacts to the fabric, odor and moisture, even how your towel stretches.",
      "The result is well engineered, machine washable, and beyond softness towel you'll want to use every single day.",
      "When we developed fabrics, we engineer them for optimal performance which balances softness, performance, and ease of care. Our team of designers have made a quantum leap in towel design.",
      "By backing this project you are helping make it a reality. So as an added bonus, any backer who shares this project will receive a free toiletry bag!",
      "Click the share button at the top of the page! Then message or comment to let us know you have shared.",
      "Our team is the first designers in the world to launch an innovative new bath towel \u2013 which uses this technology originally developed for astronauts \u2013 to further improve your everyday essential.",
      "From the moment you touch the material, Apollo Towel feels soft on your skin and body with up to 4x more softness & cushioning than any other towel on this planet.",
      "Born from space science, and driven by design engineering, Apollo was founded on the pursuit of building the best fabric technology on the planet and beyond.",
      "We\u2019ve yet to find something that is softer. Apollo designed to be the softest towel and made from high-quality blends of the best materials.",
      "After hours of investigation, research & development, using nanotechnology inspired by NASA we've refined our fabric and built a better towel. Which delivers premium quality, high-tech performance & maximum softness.",
      "Many towels are made the same materials and haven't changed in a long time, but the look and feel of a Towel largely depend on what type of material is used.",
      "Using advanced composite materials to create high-performance fibers using our cotton / polymer matrix blend & engineered with nanite technology. We call it XPLORE 11\u00ae.",
      "We've developed a new way to use nanomaterials in fabrication. Our technique involves selectively placing modified polymer into the yarn resin to create a nanocomposite that has increased properties on strength, absorption and softness on a scale never done before.",
      "The patenting process is ongoing with the support of the kickstarter & Indiegogo community we can ensure the protection of our intellectual property and continue the legal and costly exercise to further the patenting process.",
      "The result is a technological leap in fabric & towel design. Apollo now makes nanomaterials more accessible, versatile and ready for use in your home.",
      "Towels designed and priced for everyday use are made of sub-standard materials. With our trademarked composite material to create the best cushioning in the universe.",
      "It has been tested against more than 30 other fabrics -- every towel we could find out there.",
      "The Apollo Towel produces the right balance of softness, absorbency and quickness to dry \u2014 the most important attributes for any towel.",
      "Each thread is finer than one denier, having a diameter of less than ten micrometers giving each towel a lightweight and flexible shape. Providing anti-wrinkle properties while being extremely comfortable to touch. Finally this gives it efficient water benefits for use after every daily shower.",
      "An unprecedented leap in features with mind\u2011blowing benefits you will enjoy daily.",
      "One of the softness materials every created-on earth, and beyond.",
      "Softness: A key determining aspect of softness is the size of the fiber. Finer fibers are less likely to exert a concentrated force on our skin's surface receptors, whilst larger diameter fibers are more durable, so it's a balance.",
      "In order to produce the best balanced towels that are both soft & durable, we've used a refined texture through advanced weaving techniques. Each towel is made from ultra-fine cotton / polyester mix yarn containing a superb air layer that has a light yet luxurious feel.",
      "The manufacturing process brings out the natural softness of the material and makes them as soft and silky as cashmere, yet durable enough for everyday use.",
      "Making Apollo one of the softest towels ever.",
      "Cheap towels are typically not very absorbent and tend to produce excessive amounts of lint due to the use of uncombed cotton.",
      "Thanks to our XPLORE 11\u00ae fabric,  the Apollo Towel has the ability to rapidly absorb liquid. Helping remove that irritating and damp that\u2019s synonymous with common towels.",
      "The result, the most absorbent towel hands down making you feel like an astronaut in your home.",
      "Although natural fibers of cotton are strong, they need a little help from polyester for structure and durability which ensures your towel lasts a lifetime.",
      "Using a higher quality yarn combined with a reinforced weave, Apollo Towels outlasts regular towels wash after wash.",
      "With the added benefit of REINFORCED DOUBLE STITCHING to ensure the highest durability of any towel ever.",
      "Apollo has odor-fighting technology derived from the slight mix of polyethylene which prevents smells.",
      "No one wants their towel to take forever to dry. Apollo Towels use high tech fabric that outperforms other bath towels. You'll find these towels are extremely fast-drying, allowing them to be ready between uses. Making them equally brilliant for travel, gym and home.",
      "Our Mission",
      "We use innovative materials, advanced construction & a timeless aesthetic to engineer scientifically better products.",
      "Who We Are",
      "A team of passionate people who enjoy science, innovation, space and pushing the boundaries of design. Together using our backgrounds, experience and networks to develop something truly unique and wonderful. Everything we do, we hope to inspire awe and delight. Look to the stars!",

With over 10 years of marketing experience across multiple industries, I\u2019ve consistently delivered results and am now channeling that expertise into a business built on passion and opportunity.",

Market research shows strong local interest in classic car rentals, complementing Atlanta\u2019s thriving experience-driven culture, and we are the only company that will be able to offer a self-driving experience for customers. I\u2019m seeking investment to launch Spartan Classics, meet this demand, and scale into other cities, offering memorable, nostalgic experiences for a modern audience.",

      "I have invested in the foundation of the business including acquiring the appropriate legal documentation, building our website, and securing the financial software needed to operate the business.",
      "The Impact",

      "Combining efficiency, durability, and portability to provide you with a superior coffee grinding experience \u2014 for barista-quality coffee, anywhere you go.",
      "Ever wondered why your cup of coffee at the coffeeshop tastes so much better than what you get at home? We\u2019ll spill the (coffee) beans: A fresh and even coffee grind.",
      "You know, most coffee grinders on the market, especially the cheap ones, come with \u2014 dare we say it \u2014 blade grinders. They work, but will always give you an uneven grind that just doesn\u2019t cut it.",
      "Moreover, pre-ground coffee loses aroma, as the essential fatty acids responsible for rich flavor vaporize over time. That\u2019s why, for a rich coffee flavor, freshly ground coffee is an absolute must.",
      "Even if you have the best coffee machine in the world, if your grind isn\u2019t fresh and even, you\u2019re going to end up with a cup of coffee that just doesn\u2019t come close to barista-quality.",
      "And that\u2019s exactly where Goudveer F1 shines.",
      "The secret behind a great cup of coffee lies in the grind. Goudveer F1 features a patented conical burr grinder (more on that below) in a unique motor-burr system, designed for precision and durability.",
      "Crafted from the highest quality 420 stainless steel with a Rockwell hardness of 50+ HRC, it provides unmatched tensile strength.",
      "And the result? Coffee beans that are always ground to the perfect size \u2014 for a cup of coffee that's full of flavor and depth, just the way you love it.",
      "Goudveer F1 offers both automatic and manual modes for the ultimate coffee-making flexibility. So you get to use the motor module to get your beans ground up with just a press of the button, or snap on the manual grinder add-on and enjoy that super-satisfying manual grinding action.",
      "*Please note that the hand crank comes as an add-on.",
      "You can finally take the taste of barista-brewed coffee anywhere you go. Out camping, traveling, road trips, at the office (excellent for AeroPress) \u2014 or for your daily brew in a cozy corner in your kitchen. It\u2019s battery powered, so you don\u2019t need a power outlet, its portable mini size fits snugly in your hand and your backpack, making it perfect for those on-the-go coffee cravings.",
      "Finetune and get the exact grind you need for any type of coffee \u2014 from course for french press, all the way to the finest grind for a creamy cup of espresso.",
      "With a 48mm five-star conical burr and a 100-level adjustment knob (fine-tune control) \u2014 each level adjusting 0.018 mm (18 microns) \u2014 you can get your coffee grind the way you like it, just like the pros. Anytime, every time.",
      "The Goudveer F1's versatility allows you to enjoy a wide range of coffee styles. Here's a quick guide to help you find the perfect setting for your preferred brewing method:",
      "Remember, these are starting points, and you may want to fine-tune the settings based on your specific taste preferences and the particularities of your coffee beans. The Goudveer F1's precise adjustment capability ensures you can experiment to find your perfect cup!",
      "Thanks to its patented Ultra Stable conical burr design paired with a high RPM stable brushless motor, the Goudveer F1 stands out in its class. It delivers a consistent and evenly distributed grind, crucial for achieving barista-level espresso and pour-over coffee.",
      "This meticulous engineering combats the common issue of channeling \u2014 a pitfall of uneven grind sizes found in other grinders \u2014 that can significantly affect the taste of your coffee. With the Goudveer F1, each brew is a step closer to perfection, free from the inconsistencies that mar the coffee experience.",
      "Battery-operated, this grinder allows up to 35-50 grinding cycles on a single charge. In other words \u2014 that\u2019s an amazing month-long battery life!",
      "No need to hunt for power outlets or deal with annoying power cords ruining your zen. Coffee moments should be happy moments \u2014 and with Goudveer F1, you get to enjoy the freedom of grinding without limits.",
      "Don't you hate it when you have to smack your coffee grinder out after every grind to prevent more and more residue from getting stuck behind? Left behind residue equals bitter coffee, and no one likes bitter coffee \u2014 so Goudveer F1 comes with a direct structure that ensures every bit of the coffee bean is extracted without leaving behind any residue. Now you can focus on making, not smacking, and enjoy maximum flavor.",
      "Experience fully automated grind control with just the press of a button. Set it, forget it, and return to a ready-to-go grind. Plus, you no longer need to worry about damage from a stuck piece of coffee bean. The grinder will automatically stop when a hard foreign chunk gets stuck \u2014 keeping your Goudveer F1 safe and in top condition. For a long time to go.",
      "Enjoy your morning ritual without the distracting noise, and be amazed at how silent a coffee grinder can be. At just 60 dB, the Goudveer F1 operates with such a low hum, it's barely audible. No more disturbing the tranquil morning calm or waking up your family with a loud grinding noise. Turn your morning coffee preparation into a peaceful moment that\u2019s just for you.",
      "With a premium all-aluminum construction in a stunning gold color that will elevate any space, the Goudveer F1 is one that you\u2019ll want to show off. Today, tomorrow, always. It\u2019s a sleek and stylish, timeless statement piece that belongs on your kitchen counter, or wherever you choose to make coffee magic happen.",
      "Nothing beats the superiority of burr grinders. Unlike blade grinders which indiscriminately chop coffee beans resulting in inconsistent grind sizes, burr grinders crush them to a uniform size. This results in a balanced extraction, and ultimately, a better cup of coffee.",
      "And so, at the heart of Goudveer F1 lies our patented burr drive system \u2014 a groundbreaking innovation that sets it apart in the world of coffee grinders. Its unique design ensures horizontal stability by keeping a short distance from the motor to the burr. This significantly reduces burr wobble, which can lead to an inconsistent grind.",
      "This attention to detail positions the Goudveer F1 as a coffee grinder that doesn't just match your expectations, but exceeds them.",
      "Every cup will be a promise of precision, consistency, and most importantly, unmatched flavor. It's not just about making coffee; it's about experiencing the joy of a really good cup\u2026 every, single, time.",

      "Goudveer F1 is built with top-notch materials to ensure it stands the test of time and daily use.",
      "For the grinder, we went with high-quality 420 stainless steel known for its robustness and non-corrosive nature \u2014 with a Rockwell hardness of at least 50 HRC. This means it won't wear out, no matter how much coffee you grind.",
      "As for the body, you get a premium-looking all-aluminum design. Not only does this provide a sleek, modern aesthetic that will complement any environment, it is also incredibly durable, lightweight and easy to handle.",
      "Other grinders might lose their edge with use. But your Goudveer F1 will keep on going. It\u2019s a lifelong companion for your coffee journey.",
      "Not that you\u2019re going to need it very often (month-long battery life, remember?) \u2014 but Goudveer F1 comes equipped with a Type-C fast charging port. So you can charge it up fully in just 30 minutes with any Type-C charger \u2014 even with your power bank.

      "Grinding with Goudveer F1 is as easy as it gets.",
      "The vision for Goudveer emerged in the heart of the Netherlands \u2014 where the rich aroma of coffee beans blends with centuries-old traditions. Surrounded by Amsterdam\u2019s historic streets and overlooking its tranquil canals, our founders were inspired by the weightlessness of a feather and the unmatched luxury of gold. Thus, naming our brand \u201cGoudveer\u201d \u2014 Dutch for Gold Feather.",
      "A symbol of luxuriousness, yet light in form, Goudveer embodies the meticulous Dutch craftsmanship, refined over generations, and the fervent spirit of innovation from the United States. As dusk painted the Dutch skies one evening, our artisans, sipping on a brew that echoed the Netherlands\u2019 profound coffee culture, envisioned a creation that would seamlessly bridge the Atlantic, drawing on the cultural magnificence of both lands.",
      "And so, the Goudveer F1 was born \u2014 a masterpiece that blends Dutch legacy with American ingenuity. Every Goudveer F1 carries with it tales of two nations, harmoniously coming together into a singular, luxurious experience.",
      "As we take you on this transcendent journey through the rich tapestries of our heritage, we invite you to feel the weight of history and the lightness of innovation with every sip you take.",

      "Our story with Linky began 8 years ago when we started producing and selling the first version of the foldable electric longboard. Kickstarter was the platform that we used to present our product to the world. Even if we managed to reach more than 80.000$, unfortunately, our first campaign was not successful mostly due to inexperience in marketing and specifically in crowdfunding. We didn't give up, we kept going and with the lesson learned we improved our marketing and managed to find the funding to start the production of Linky. The success of the Linky 1.0 has demonstrated to us that its main feature, the folding system was efficient, resistant, and highly appreciated by our users. The evolution into Linky 2.0 started from there. Our research and development team has been working for about 4 years around the widely tested and approved \"folding system\" to improve the quality of the experience of our customers by providing a real vehicle that could be used as an alternative to cars in the city environment. We started by gathering feedback from the many users of the Linky 1.0 and we came out with a layout of the new product that, from the outside can look quite similar to the first one but, from a technological and UX standpoint represents a complete revolution. The major difficulty has been to improve the product in many aspects while maintaining the portability (weight and dimensions) at the top. The main points of difference and innovation where we focused our studies and investments are the following:",
      "We believe that Linky 2.0 represents not just a product evolution but a revolution in urban mobility. Our dedication to improving upon the original model, coupled with our focus on sustainability and community feedback, underscores our commitment to delivering a transformative product.",
      "Linky is the world pioneer of foldable e-skates. We invented the best folding mechanism, protected by an international patent. The use of high-strength plastic polymers combined with our engineering experience allowed us to make it both sturdy and light.",
      "Linky\u2019s system of joints makes sure that the skate safely remains in the open position during riding. We\u2019ve worked hard on perfecting the opening and closing mechanism so that it is as smooth and easy as possible. The two parts slide pretty effortlessly open. The mechanism takes literally seconds to open and close.",

For instance, zinc is used to coat other metals as an anti-corrosion agent, while bismuth forms rainbow-coloured crystals on its surface upon oxidisation.

Density Cubes has been fully prototyped, and I have the capacity to produce the sets in copious volumes if required. But of course with any new project like this, there is a small chance of unanticipated delay, perhaps due to a late shipment arrival or items failing my quality testing and needing to therefore be replaced. In order to hedge and overcome these risks I have accounted for the addition of multiple weeks into the delivery date. I am 100% ready to bring Density Cubes to market, so you too can have a piece of science on your desk.

    "company_name": "Liberux Labs S.L.",
    "allParagraphs": [
      "THIS CAMPAIGN IS CLOSED",
      "Liberux NEXX",
      "THE LINUX PHONE YOU\u2019VE BEEN WAITING FOR.",
      "THE LINUX PHONE YOU\u2019VE BEEN WAITING FOR.",
      "The phone for free people.\nMost smartphones today are built around a model that prioritizes the manufacturer\u2019s control over the user\u2019s freedom. There\u2019s a deep lack of transparency, growing conflicts of interest, and constant surveillance disguised as convenience. We set out to build something different. Liberux NEXX is our answer: a phone that doesn\u2019t spy on you, doesn\u2019t hide its code, and doesn\u2019t rely on opaque commercial agendas. It\u2019s a solution that\u2019s free, ethical, and open. We chose Open Source as our foundation and privacy as a principle \u2014 not a product. This is a device for those who refuse to trade their digital sovereignty for comfort.",
      "The Liberux NEXX is a high-performance Linux smartphone designed from the ground up for privacy, openness, and power. It packs an octa-core Rockchip RK3588S CPU (4\u00d7Cortex-A76 + 4\u00d7Cortex-A55 up to 2.4\u202fGHz) with 32\u202fGB LPDDR4x RAM and a 6.34\u2033 2400\u00d71080 OLED display. Storage is plentiful \u2013 512\u202fGB of replaceable and expandable eMMC plus expandable microSD (up to 2\u202fTB) \u2013 and connectivity includes dual USB-C ports, 5G, Wi-Fi 5, Bluetooth 5.0, and even a headphone jack.",
      "The NEXX runs LiberuxOS, a Debian 13-based Linux distribution that is ethical and open-source. The system uses a Liberux customiced Gnome Shell Mobile, providing a polished, multitasking-friendly interface adapted to smartphones and tablets. It's designed with convergence in mind: when connected to a larger screen and keyboard, the interface shifts into a desktop-style environment. You can use NEXX as your daily smartphone \u2013 and then turn it into a full workstation in seconds.",
      "The software is also compatible with Android applications, thanks to container-based isolation (like WayDroid), which allows you to use popular apps without compromising system integrity or user privacy.",
      "Hardware kill-switches let you physically cut power to the modem, Wi-Fi/Bluetooth module, and camera/microphone system whenever you choose, ensuring your data stays private. When all three switches are flipped down, they also disable additional components like the GNSS unit (GPS and related satellite systems), the IMU (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer), and ambient and proximity sensors. In short, NEXX combines laptop-class specs with user-owned software \u2013 making it one of the most powerful, open, and secure Linux phones to date.",
      "Building on years of Linux expertise (our team\u2019s past projects and passion for freedom), Liberux NEXX was inspired by the desire to give people \u201cfreedom to own your hardware, your software, and your own life\u201d. We envision a phone you can upgrade and customize for years, not a disposable gadget. Every aspect \u2013 from the removable memory and 5300\u202fmAh battery to planned 5-year software support \u2013 is aimed at resisting planned obsolescence and mass data collection. Our roadmap even includes accessories (like a wireless RDP dock or a keyboard) to turn your phone into a full PC when needed. In short, NEXX stands for privacy, security, and freedom \u2013 a true pocket computer that respects you.",
      "High-End Performance: 8\u2011core (up to 2.4\u202fGHz) CPU, 32\u202fGB LPDDR4x RAM, and 512\u202fGB storage (plus optional 2\u202fTB microSD) \u2013 enough power to run desktop-class Linux apps on the go.",
      "Open-Source OS: LiberuxOS (Debian 13-based) puts you in control of software. Install and update safely (Debian is known for stability), with most source code available and 5+ years of planned updates.",
      "Privacy by Design: No built-in tracking \u2013 \u201cwe will not collect or monitor any of your data\u201d. Includes 3 physical kill-switches.",
      "Extensive Connectivity: Dual USB-C 3.1 ports, 3.5\u202fmm audio jack, and modern radios (5G, Wi-Fi 5, Bluetooth 5.0) for everything you need.",
      "Desktop-Capable: Use NEXX as a mini-PC. With our planned wireless monitor/keyboard adapter (RDP support), you can connect to a monitor and peripherals to get a full desktop experience.",
      "Long Battery & Expandability: Large 5300\u202fmAh removable battery, plus a second USB-C port so you can charge while using accessories. The sturdy design and replaceable components maximize lifespan and reduce e-waste.",
      "At Liberux, our commitment is simple: every euro raised through this crowdfunding campaign will be fully invested into making this device better \u2014 in both hardware and software. Our goal is to create a free, ethical, repairable, and user-respecting ecosystem.",
      "We\u2019re not here to maximize profit. We\u2019re here to offer a real alternative in a market dominated by closed, disposable, and controlling devices. That\u2019s why every development choice, every supplier, and every component is chosen with care \u2014 favoring local, ethical manufacturing and a transparent production process.",
      "The Liberux Nexx is designed for continuous improvement. Key components like the battery and eMMC storage are easily accessible and replaceable. We want users to repair, upgrade, and extend the lifespan of their device \u2014 without depending on us or any corporation.",
      "Backing us means more than just getting a product. It means helping shape a different kind of tech future.",
      "During the years of development of Liberux NEXX, we've been fortunate to experiment with many of the devices that paved the way for open mobile technology. From the legendary Nokia N900 to gems like Purism\u2019s Librem 5 or Pine64\u2019s PinePhone Pro, we\u2019ve bought, analyzed, and learned from each one of them. Personally, we want to thank all the teams behind these projects. The work they do is remarkable\u2014not just for its technical achievements, but for their ethical commitment to user freedom. Our heartfelt thanks go to Purism, Pine64, PostmarketOS, Mobian, and the entire community that continues to push the boundaries of what\u2019s possible in free software and open hardware. Without them, none of this would exist. We hope to add our own contribution and help build the future we all want to see: one where technology respects our freedom.",
      "As for the current landscape, the Linux smartphone market is still limited, and most available devices feature modest or older-generation hardware. For example, the original PinePhone and PinePhone Pro use low-performance Rockchip SoCs and offer only 3\u20134\u202fGB of RAM, while the Librem 5 runs on a 28\u202fnm i.MX8M with 3\u202fGB of RAM. These phones are excellent for enthusiasts and developers, but they don\u2019t compete in performance with conventional smartphones.",
      "In this context, Liberux NEXX breaks those limits: with 32\u202fGB of RAM, 5G support, and a cutting-edge RK3588S processor, it stands as one of the most powerful Linux smartphones ever created. It also offers up to 2.5\u202fTB of removable storage, a user-replaceable battery, and physical killswitches to maximize privacy. It\u2019s a device designed not just for technical users, but for anyone who wants a complete, modern, and ethical mobile experience. In short, NEXX is an evolutionary leap within the Linux smartphone ecosystem.",
      "We already have a working prototype of the Liberux NEXX and are actively testing its hardware and software stack. Our first mainboard has been fully assembled and debugged: after resolving a few minor hardware issues (such as solder-mask adjustments and component alignment), the RK3588S processor is now detected and communicating correctly with a host PC.",
      "In parallel, we\u2019re collaborating with a local manufacturing partner to improve PCB yield. Our software team is porting Debian 13 to the device, adapting GNOME Shell Mobile for daily use, and integrating Android app compatibility via a sandboxed container. These steps bring us close to a fully functional, user-ready platform.",
      "This campaign will allow us to transition from a tested engineering prototype to a certified and manufactured device, ready to ship to our backers.",
      "The Liberux NEXX has been designed with a modular architecture for key components: storage, memory, and mobile modem. This enables not only repairability and upgrades, but also the reuse of parts in future motherboard revisions.",
      "Storage (eMMC):\n  We use interchangeable modules compatible with the same standard sockets used by Orange Pi and Radxa.",

      "After over a year of extensive development, testing, CAD CAM, prototyping and R&D, we've finally come up with the perfect design and are ready to mass produce these tickers.",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------",
      "Our estimated ship dates for IndieGogo pre-orders are Feb 2022! So that means after the campaign is funded, we will immediately begin production! From ordering components, to manufacturing the ticker frames, hand assembling the tickers, packaging, testing and doing QA on the software. Should any issues with the Feb 2022 deadline arise, we will be sure to notify all backers and keep them updated!",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------",
      "We estimate that we can start shipping units around February 2022. Units will be shipped from our warehouse in Hong Kong. With that said, expect international shipping time to be around 2 weeks long.",
      "We should be able to ship to almost all countries in the world. However, there are a few select countries that our carrier cannot ship to. If we can't ship to your country, we will notify you immediately and offer full refund / cancel your pledge.",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------",
      "The Fintic team will work hard to push new updates and features for users to enjoy! Given that the ticker is powered by a mini computer, the possibilities are endless!",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------",
      "Fintic Limited was founded in September 2020 by Justin Dunn and Neythen Treloar. Coming from a background in game design and data analytics, natural sciences and scientific computing respectively, both Justin and Neythen took their passion for LED lights, electronics and the stock market to create a beautiful looking desk size LED ticker. Together, they share the mission and vision of making information more accessible and beautiful, pixel by pixel.",

      "Risks and challenges",
      "1. Potential delays with manufacturer: Depending on the overall demand for this product, if the demand exceeds the total supply that our manufacturers and suppliers can offer, this could cause potential delays in the shipping of components required to assemble these tickers. In this scenario, we will be sure to work vigorously with our manufacturers to increase volume of production and ensure that supply chain is fully operational to meet the demand. Should this problem arise, we will also be transparent and let all our backers know about such problem and keep them fully updated on the situation.",
      "2. Failure to meet expected delivery date: Again, relating to the possibility of demand exceeding supply, given that we are a relatively small team, and the tickers are all hand assembled, we may not have enough labour force to meet the demand. Should we start falling behind schedule, the plan would be to hire even more staff to help assemble, package and ship the tickers as quickly as possible. We could also outsource assembly work to factories in China to speed things up.",
      "3. By backing this project, you agree to our terms of service, return policy and privacy policy listed on our website: https://fintic.io/",
      "Long-lasting design",
      "E-waste is something that we are very concerned with and have thought through carefully. With that said, we source some of the highest quality hardware and components to ensure that the product will last as long as possible. The hardware design also makes it so that repairing the tickers is very simple and easily accessible.",

      "Botanium Vega is a compact, easy and effortless way of growing. Its a hydroponic pot, which means it grows plants like chilies, herbs and tomatoes without soil. It waters the plants automatically.  Leave it for a month and get back to a healthy plant.",
      "Botanium was first revealed on Kickstarter early 2017. In only 5 days we were fully funded with 1420 backers from all over the world. In the end of same year we shipped around 2500 units to 65 different countries. We are now ready to launch our second product - Botanium Vega.",
      "Botanium Vega is minimalistically designed self-watering planter that enables you to grow herbs and veggies using soil-less growing technology.",
      "Plant a seed, plug it in and you can leave it alone for weeks as it takes care of the plant for you. You get more productive plants and there is no need to worry about over or under watering, the most common ways to kill plants.",
      "There is a rising demand for ways to grow your own food. In a modern busy life, tending to a plant\u2019s needs might be your last priority. And even if you do have time, you might not know how to keep it alive. Enjoy growing herbs or chili without effort. Botanium Vega takes care of the plant for you, thanks to automated, soil-free growing. Botanium Vega comes with a wider design than its predecessor with room for up to four plants.",
      "Vega features a water tank with room for 5 liter (1.3 gallon) of water. Compared with our first Botanium, this is 5x the volume and 25% more water per plant. (if you grow four plants in it). Thanks to this, the water lasts for many weeks.",
      "Vega automatically waters your plants multiple times per day. We have also made it possible to change this schedule so that you can make it water every hour or just once every day.",
      "Botanium Vega uses soil-less - so called hydroponic - gardening technology to grow plants from seed. This has many advantages - the plants can grow larger using less roots, and they will also regrow quicker after harvest.",
      "This also enables the Vega to automatically water the plants without needing to measure the moisture in the soil.",
      "By popular request, our new Botanium Vega is connected to your smartphone using the Botanium app. Use it to get notifications when you need to refill it, and to monitor your Botanium when you are away from home.",
      "We also include a powerful 20 watt LED growing light that enables you to grow anywhere - even during the dark winter. It can be adjusted in height and controlled through the Botanium app.",
      "Hydroponics is simply growing without soil. The roots need water, nutrients and oxygen, all of which can be provided in a more efficient way than in soil. Botanium's porous growing medium absorbs a lot of water, while also providing an aerated environment for the roots.",
      "The benefits of this are not only quicker growth and more control, but also a simpler approach to growing.",
      "The great thing about hydroponics is that you can never overwater the plants you grow. Therefore, you don't need to take into account things like letting the soil dry out before watering again (and not waiting too long so your plants wilt).\n\n  All you need to do is to fill the reservoir when you see the water level getting low. The water lasts several week (depending on the plant, light and heat)",
      ">",
      "At Botanium, we believe that gardening should be simple and available to everyone, even to those living in a city or without much time to take care of a plant. We want to change how greens and herbs are produced indoors, making it possible to bring out the gardener in everyone.",
      "Grow basil",
      "Basil grows quite fast and is a good alternative for the impatient grower. As it needs a lot of water, it thrives in the Botanium where it gets watered often and evenly.",
      "Grow tomatoes",
      "Like its' relatives chili peppers, potatoes and tobacco, tomatoes originate from South America. It is a fast growing plant that thrives in hydroponic systems like Botanium.",
      "Grow chili",
      "What makes chili growing so rewarding is that even a small amount of chili lasts a long time \u2013 in contrast to strawberries for instance, which you easily can eat faster than it grows.",
      "You can also grow rocket salad, thyme, oregano, strawberries, mint and much much more.",
      "Botanium Vega features a 20 watt growing light that is adjustable in height. So as your plants grow you can unscrew the knob and adjust the light accordingly.",
      "The lamp is equipped with state-of-the-art LEDs that are attached to a lamp screen made of extruded aluminum. This screen does not only eliminates glare, but also works as a powerful heatsink that makes it possible to run the LEDs cool - making them run efficently at 175 lumen per watt.",
      "The lamp can be removed if you have a sunny window and you don't need the extra light.",
      "When talking with Botanium users, it was clear that a highly requested feature was app connectivity. And we listened! From the very start, it was important for us to make an app only if it made sense, and if it could be useful. We didn't want to create an app that is just another gimmick. The Botanium Vega has optimized default settings in place that doesn't require you to use the app - but it does add extra controls and features.",
      "The Botanium app is connected to Vega with wi-fi, so you can keep track of your grow wherever you are.",
      "Water level",
      "Keep track of the current water level and get notified when the water level runs low. If you plan to be away from home a few weeks, you can easily check if you need to refill before leaving.",
      "Nutrients",
      "Different kind of plants have different nutrient demands. The Botanium app calculates the right amount of nutrient based on the plants you grow. Specify what you grow, and it will tell you how much nutrients you need to add each time you refill the water.",
      "Lamp",
      "Turn the lamp on and off from your couch. You can also schedule when the lamp turns on or off, so that you don't need to be disturbed by it early in on a sunday morning.",
      "Botanium is designed in Sweden, a country that embodies the Scandinavian design movement. This style \u2013 often referred to as minimalist \u2013 developed during the Second World War, with clean, simple lines and a strong emphasis on functionality. A common theme in this tradition is that beautiful and functional objects should be available to all.",
      "Botanium Vega consists of a 5 liter water tank and a growing container. A water pump moves water up to top, and distributes it evenly over the growing medium. It trickles down and returns back to the water tank, so it later can be reused.",
      "Dimensions: 530 mm (20,9\") x 145 mm (5,7\") x 200 mm (7.9\") (without lamp)\nColor: White (if the stretch goal is achieved, two additional colors will be unlocked.)\nPlug: Vega will be shipped with plugs for Europe, US, UK and Australia/New Zealand.\nPower: 12V\nLamp: 20 w LED light, 200 ppfd @ 100 mm\nConnectivity: Wi-fi\nUsage: Indoor use only",
      "We have been testing several functioning prototypes over the last year to make sure that it works as intended. Since Vega is the evolution of our first product, we have applied what we have learned from that and improved it.",
      "It is important to us that it does not only work as intended and looks good, but also that the design is user-friendly and intuitive.",
      "Botanium was founded in Stockholm in 2016 by a group of designers and engineers with a passion for creating innovative products that enable everyone to grow their own food without compromising their modern lifestyle. We strive to accelerate and simplify urban gardening, enabling everyone to be a grower.",
      "We are glad to have such a competent team that can make Botanium Vega a reality!",
      "Wanna grow in a Botanium now and can't wait until 2021?

      "No odd, half-sized, or proprietary bits here. We understand that everyone has different needs when it comes to daily tasks. So, being able to store and use 7 standard 1/4\" hex bits that you already own allows you to quickly customize the bit bar to your needs.",
      "Why limit yourself to one function? The UltraFix is designed to tackle a variety of tasks, allowing you to drive screws in any direction\u2014be it vertically, horizontally, or at challenging angles. You\u2019ll appreciate the freedom and speed it brings to your work, minimizing the need to switch between tools, thus allowing you to work more efficiently.",
      "Tackle those hard-to-reach screws effortlessly with the built-in extension rod.",
      "This thoughtful feature ensures that no task is out of reach, making it ideal for various applications\u2014from assembling furniture to making precise repairs. The UltraFix adapts to your needs, letting you conquer every project with ease.",
      "The UltraFix features powerful magnetic connections in both the bit storage and triple drive angles (three directional slots), ensuring smooth and reliable performance.",
      "With strong magnets for steady operation and faster workflow, UltraFix makes every task seamless, whether overhead, at odd angles, or in tight spaces.",
      "Screwdrivers without ratchets require you to continuously reposition your hand, which is both inefficient and time-consuming, especially during repetitive tasks. A ratchet allows you to turn screws without lifting and readjusting your grip. This simple mechanism makes repairs faster and smoother.",
      "However, not all ratchet designs are created equal\u2014many on the market come with significant drawbacks that we set out to solve.",
      "In conventional edc screwdrivers, the ratchet mechanism is embedded into the tool. You turn it one way for forward motion and flip the tool for reverse motion. The problem? This design doesn\u2019t hold the bit securely\u2014you often have to manually press the bit in place, which is both awkward and inefficient.",
      "To improve on this, some ratchets are designed to be detachable and magnetically reversed. While this solves the bit-holding problem, it introduces new issues:",
      "Neither solution truly delivers a seamless experience. That\u2019s where the UltraFix Ratchet comes in.",
      "We completely reimagined the ratchet mechanism to overcome these challenges:\nThe UltraFix features a fully enclosed ratchet mechanism. This ensures durability, eliminates wear and tear issues, and provides a smooth, reliable operation for years to come.",
      "Changing the ratchet direction is as simple as pressing the directional button. No flipping, detaching, or fumbling\u2014just a smooth transition between forward, reverse, and locked positions.",
      "In short, The UltraFix ratchet doesn\u2019t just solve the problems of existing tools\u2014it redefines what a compact, efficient screwdriver can be.",
      "Titanium alloy offers the perfect balance of strength, lightness, and durability, making it the ideal material for high-performance tools like the UltraFix. Resistant to rust, wear, and tear, the UltraFix is designed to handle the demands of daily use while retaining its sleek, polished appearance. Lightweight, tough, and corrosion-proof, it\u2019s a tool that delivers unmatched performance wherever you go\u2014built to last, crafted from the ultimate material.",

      "Made from durable titanium, the pry bar combines strength with portability. Small enough to carry, powerful enough to deliver.",
      "A window breaker isn\u2019t something you use every day, but when you need it, it\u2019s absolutely essential. By integrating this function into the UltraFix, we ensure it\u2019s always within reach as part of your EDC toolkit. Whether for personal safety or unexpected situations, this tool provides peace of mind wherever you go.",
      "With the UltraFix window breaker, you\u2019re equipped for life\u2019s unexpected emergencies\u2014whether for yourself or others. It\u2019s more than a tool; it\u2019s a lifesaver in your pocket.",
      "When you\u2019re on the move, the UltraFix has you covered. The built-in pocket clip allows you to secure it to your pocket or bag, ensuring it\u2019s always within reach.",
      "Plus, the integrated lanyard hole provides extra grip, so you\u2019ll never risk losing this indispensable tool during crucial moments.",
      "Craftsmanship doesn\u2019t stop at sundown. With three tritium slots, the UltraFix is designed for low-light conditions\u2014perfect for those late-night projects. You\u2019ll always be prepared to tackle any task, regardless of the time of day or night.",
      "Your tools should match your personality. UltraFix offers two premium finishes:",
      "Both finishes deliver the same durability and performance. Choose the one that fits your style and make the UltraFix truly yours.",
      "Equip yourself with a screwdriver that stands tall, ready to face whatever life\u2014and your projects\u2014throw your way.",
      "Every reward comes with a durable titanium alloy stonewashed finish, designed to handle frequent use while retaining its sleek appearance over time.

      "We\u2019re building Trovador, the world\u2019s first autonomous robot that can plant tree seedlings quickly and effectively on any terrain \u2013 and it\u2019s already been recognized globally (see below).",
      "But we need your support to bring it to life and start restoring forests before the next fire season hits!",
      "Growing up, we spent a lot of time around Portugal\u2019s forests and mountains. But every summer, we watched more of these landscapes go from green to grey\u2026 and stay that way for years.",
      "These are forests that should still be standing, and now urgently need to be brought back.\nBut right now, we don\u2019t have the tools to bring them back fast enough.",
      "The result? Biodiversity disappears, erosion gets worse, fire risk increases\u2026 and we lose our planet\u2019s #1 carbon sink.",
      "We\u2019ve volunteered in reforestation efforts ourselves, but quickly realized that current methods (manual planting, tractors, drones\u2026) simply aren\u2019t restoring forests anywhere near the pace we need. See our FAQ for why.",
      "We couldn\u2019t help but wonder: If fire can tear through a forest in minutes, why does it have to take years even to begin bringing it back?",
      "That question stuck with us. And eventually, Trovador became our answer!",
      "An autonomous robot that can do what no other method today can: reforest steep, burned terrain with speed, precision, and care.",
      "Our first prototype, built from recycled materials, proved the concept and gained global attention. Now we\u2019re building the full-scale version.",
      "What makes Trovador unique:",

      "And if we raise more than our goal? Every extra euro will go into planting more trees or upgrading the robot.",
      "In short: every cent goes directly into making large-scale reforestation possible, whether in Portugal or, eventually, anywhere it's needed.",
      "We know 14,000\u20ac sounds like a lot, and it is. But it\u2019s the necessary amount to make this solution real. For perspective, see the FAQ: \u201cIs 14,000\u20ac really necessary?\u201d",
      "Donate: even 2\u20ac builds momentum.",

      "The widespread use of digital screens, unhealthy eye habits, lack of physical activity, environmental pollution, the chemical ingredients in cosmetics and skincare products, and the pressures of daily life all pose challenges to our skin and eyes. In response to these issues, we have introduced the powerful Foodmagic 670nm Red Light Therapy Device, also known as the Foodmagic Vision Power Bank. This device is not only designed to improve vision and beauty care but can also be used to treat prickly heat, frostbite, small wounds, and more, thanks to the unique benefits of 670nm red light. It can be used year-round for daily use, effortlessly handling everything even in summer and winter!",
      "This innovative product integrates the dual functions of \"vision protection + beauty and skin care\" by utilizing 670nm red light irradiation to stimulate cell growth and accelerate metabolism. This takes you to a new level of vision and skin care.",
      "Red light has the ability to \"charge\" the mitochondria of retinal photoreceptor cells, reduce the apoptosis rate of age-related cells, and improve the function of photoreceptor cells. Additionally, it can relax the ciliary muscles of the eyes, relieve eye soreness, promote blood circulation around the eyes, enhance retinal cell metabolism, and help restore optimal vision.",
      "This technology has been extensively researched, validated, and widely recognized for its positive effects on preventing myopia in teenagers and slowing down visual decline in middle-aged and elderly individuals. Its vision protection effect is significantly superior to that of rest, massage, and hot compress therapies.",
      "Red light irradiation has been shown to enhance cell metabolism, increase glycogen content, promote protein synthesis and adenosine triphosphate decomposition, as well as stimulate cell regeneration and blood circulation within blood vessels. This makes it great for skincare, such as beauty care, addressing issues like prickly heat, frostbite, and small wounds, and more!",
      "Foodmagic abandons the common red light wave bands including 650nm and 640nm wavelengths in the past. Based on the latest international research theory, the more targeted 670nm red light is selected to repair cells in depth, so as to prevent failing eyesight, alleviate eye fatigue and improve the periocular skin.",
      "The Foodmagic boasts a diffuse reflection plate as one of its key features. This special structural design greatly improves the light receiving uniformity, improves the poor efficacy caused by uneven light radiation density, and greatly enhances the use effect.",
      "It is well established that light of varying wavelengths exhibits distinct absorption peaks in cells. Specifically, the 670nm red light wavelength closely aligns with the absorption peak of cytochrome c oxidase, a critical enzyme in the cell respiratory chain. Consequently, cells more readily absorb 670nm red light, leading to more pronounced biological effects.",
      "Compared to 650nm and 640nm red light, 670nm red light exhibits superior skin and tissue permeability. Its ability to penetrate deeper into ocular and cutaneous tissues allows for direct targeting of specific cells, resulting in more precise and effective therapeutic outcomes.",
      "Recent scientific research has demonstrated that the 670nm red light wavelength possesses distinct advantages in enhancing cellular vitality, improving blood circulation, reducing oxidative stress, and alleviating eye fatigue. These findings provide compelling evidence for our selection of 670nm red light as a more precise phototherapy wavelength.",
      "The Foodmagic exit pupil distance is 40cm/15.76inch, which is comparable to the distance at which one typically reads books, uses mobile phones, and operates computers. This distance is more in line with natural visual habits. Use it at 40cm/15.76inch from your eyes can accurately irradiate the retina and surrounding tissues of the eyes with red light.",
      "During skincare sessions, place the transparent cover in contact with the skin to achieve the best results. This cover, made of safe transparent material, allows the red light emitted by Foodmagic's LED beads to penetrate harmlessly, delivering the best possible outcomes.",
      "Our Foodmagic vision improvement device is suitable for ages 6+. Use it once a day for 3 minutes consistently for 14 days, and you will receive a surprise!",
      "Foodmagic is a lightweight, compact marvel, measuring just 89.67x 61.79 x 23.64mm/3.412x 2.433 x 0.931inch and weighing a mere 89.3g, making it incredibly portable.",
      "Keep it effortlessly accessible on your Rolls-Royce's tray, Microsoft workstation desk, inside a Hermes handbag, on QATAR's cabin table, in your makeup bag, or tucked into a portable pocket - always ready to be picked up and used whenever needed!",
      "For added convenience, we recommend sticking the magnetic plate onto the back of your phone and then attaching the Foodmagic. This allows for seamless integration with your phone's timer function. You can also secure it to any other convenient flat surface.",
      "To power on the Foodmagic, simply press the power button with your finger. Likewise, pressing the power button again with your finger will turn it off when not in use.",
      "350mAh Battery Capacity",
      "Foodmagic comes equipped with a standard Type-C charging port, providing widespread compatibility and a fast charging experience. Whether you're at home, in the office, or on the go, you can conveniently charge it anytime.",
      "Charging Indicator",
      "Please power off for charging! During the charging process, the blue light will stay on. Once the battery is fully charged, the blue light will go off.",
      "Stylish and elegant, the appearance of Foodmagic draws inspiration from the enchanting world of \"The Lord of the Rings,\" resulting in an epic masterpiece! Each use feels like a magical adventure, as the brilliant red light emanates from the power bank, resembling an artifact, illuminating your gaze.",
      "The Foodmagic is not only a highly functional product, but its aluminum alloy casing also showcases excellent heat dissipation, impact resistance, and long-lasting durability.",
      "During the product development process, we have conducted nearly 300 continuous tests and actively sought international certifications to meet safety standards for multiple countries, including FCC, UL, CE, RoHS, IC, GB4706.1, PSE, METI, UN38.3, and more.",
      "Additionally, we have applied for patents: \"Red Light Irradiation Device for Vision Restoration\" (Patent No: 2022108468669) and \"Vision Power Bank (670nm Red Light Vision Protection)\" (Patent No: 202330287578.X).",
