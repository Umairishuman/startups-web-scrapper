      "If you've faced these problems, then guess what? You\u2019ve come to the right place! I'm thrilled to introduce you to our latest creation: The Dark Fire\u2014a titanium multitool pendant lantern. It\u2019s a keychain lantern, an everlasting pen, a box opener, a pry bar, a bit driver, all packed into one sleek, space-saving design.",
      "This is not just a cool-looking accessory\u2014it\u2019s your everyday problem-solver. Whether it\u2019s finding your keys in the dark, jotting down a quick note, or effortlessly opening a box, The Dark Fire has got you covered.",
      "The Dark Fire is designed to be exceptionally compact, measuring just 13g.

      "Though it's small, designing The Dark Fire was no small feat. The challenge lay in making it compact yet multifunctional, balancing aesthetics with utility. But we did it! Now, let us share how The Dark Fire came to life.",
      "Around February this year, we first envisioned creating a keychain lantern. The idea was simple: we needed a keychain lantern to help us quickly identify our belongings, like keys, in the dark. But as we brainstormed, we thought\u2014what else could it be? We realized how frustrating it can be when you need a pen but don\u2019t have one, especially when you're out and about. So, we decided that an everlasting pen would be a great addition. With the growing popularity of online shopping and deliveries, everyone needs a tool to open boxes or perform small tasks from time to time. We\u2019ll dive into these functions in more detail later, but that\u2019s how the idea for The Dark Fire was born.",

However, our innovative design allows the tritium tube to be installed without glue, using the everlasting pen tip to secure it inside. This tool-free and adhesive-free installation process makes both the initial setup and future replacements much more convenient.",

      "Smudge-Proof Durability",
      "The Dark Fire\u2019s smudge-proof ink is ideal for important documents and personal journals.

Its integration into The Dark Fire Pendant design maintains the sleek profile while adding significant utility, making it an indispensable tool for everyday carry.",
      "The Dark Fire Pendant features a cleverly designed tapered tip that maximizes its utility. This unique shape allows the Dark Fire to function as a box opener, pry bar, and nail puller.

      "Dive into the world of TIPA, the solar marvel that is revolutionizing how we harness the sun's power. With a solid \u00a3560,000 UK government grant and acknowledgement from global solar leaders, TIPA isn't just a concept - it's the next big step in sustainable energy. Boasting three times the output of conventional solar systems, TIPA is not only efficient but also the most cost-effective choice in the market.",
      "Modular Design: With TIPA, power is portable. Set it up wherever, whenever.\nBuilt to Last: A solid 30-year lifespan guarantees long-term reliability.\nEco-Friendly: Sustainable design with recyclable components.\nGlobal Reach: TIPA knows no borders. Perfect for any market, any country.\nExpandable: The magic of daisy-chaining lets TIPA grow with you.\nPlug and Play: USB-equipped and ready for action.\nAdaptive Power: Forget aiming. TIPA works in any light.\nPower Output: One TIPA equals 45Wp. Small unit, mighty power.",

      "With TIPA, elegance meets efficiency. A sleek, portable powerhouse, TIPA isn't just another solar panel\u2014it's a game changer.",
      "The Magic Behind TIPA: Simplified Solar Science for Backers! \n\nSolar energy is all about playing catch with sunlight (or more technically, photons). When these photons meet a solar panel, they can give it energy if they \"hit\" it just right.",
      "Traditional Solar Panels:  Imagine you're trying to throw a ball through a small hoop. The angle matters, and you've only got one shot. If the ball bounces off, you miss. That's how traditional solar panels work with photons. The photons have to come in at the perfect angle to go through the protective glass and hit the silicon beneath. If they bounce off, that energy is wasted.",
      "Enter TIPA:\nWith TIPA, it's like giving that ball multiple chances to get through the hoop. We use special lenses that bend and guide the light (the ball) into our 3D solar pipe. If a photon doesn't make its mark on the first go, it bounces around inside, giving it more chances to interact and transfer its energy. More chances mean more energy captured!\n\nAnd here's the cool part: this isn't just a tweak in solar tech; it's a groundbreaking approach that you won't find anywhere else.\n\nSo, in a nutshell: TIPA gives sunlight many shots to power up, making it a true game-changer in the solar world! ????",
      "Bagged the \u00a3560,000 UK Research Grant in 2020. Breathing life into our working small-scale prototype. Redefining efficiency in solar power production.

Our patents are here to stay, with 15 years of exclusivity. Brighter horizons with upcoming projects and patent innovations.",

      "Supply is limited",
      "Dam coolers is an outdoor company with a fun attitude and innovative approach to creating.",
      "Our flagship product is our Hard Cooler which uses Vacuum Insulated Technology to keep its contents much colder for longer periods of time, while being lightweight and lower profiled to give a lean look. We like to describe it as Efficient, Versatile and Practical.",
      "Or as we say at DAM Coolers; Light.Tight.Right.",
      "This same ethos is embodied by all our other products. Our extremely useful Soft Coolers and our 2-in-1 Backpack cooler shout out those three words in every aspect of their design.",
      "Focusing on performance and real value we made our hard coolers injection molded and not roto-molded - This lends itself to the efficiency in the design and manufacturing process which you will see that our pricing reflects.",
      "Using advanced Vacuum Insulated Panel technology we get a lot of performance while maintaining plenty of volume in a small package, the kind of oomph and space you will not see in more expensive coolers.",
      "50% thinner walls or more, and up to 25% more volume!",
      "Since the early days of the first portable coolers, there have been all sorts of insulation material used to help them slow down temperature change. Sand, Foam, Down, Gas and Polyurethane (Roto-molded coolers) are a few.",
      "Some are better than others, but they all have their downsides. From hygiene to environmental impacts to weight, bulkiness and cost.",
      "Our patented patent pending design uses Vacuum Insulated Panels. It is a form of thermal insulation whereby a gas-tight enclosure surrounding an insulation material has all the atmosphere within it evacuated.",
      "Vacuum insulation technology significantly reduces molecular movement of the air between gaps, reducing heat transfer by conduction (via contact), convection (via diffusion) or radiation (UV light and other wave forms).",
      "Because of this they have about one-fifth the thermal conductivity of the best conventional insulation and thereby 5 times the thermal resistance per unit of thickness.",
      "With Ice Retention being the number one driver in the high-performance cooler market, it was a great opportunity to develop a cooler that met and outperformed the competition.",
      "The idea of DAM Coolers was born!",
      "The cooler is also designed to be simple to use. Unique to DAM Coolers is the upside down D-Latch system, made to be ergonomic and easy on the wrists.",
      "Each time you bend down to grab a drink you will be greeted by a smooth, unique looking, easy to handle grip that you pull up towards you with 2 fingers supporting the lid with your thumb and then out,  to reveal your treasure inside.",
      "We set our cooler against the latest and the greatest for a 'head to head' ice retention test several times and it always performed extremely well.",
      "Here is our latest result.",
      "In a \u201cFull to the Brim\u201d ice test in temperatures between 80 and 115 degrees, with an average of about 87 degrees,  the DAM 25 was able to hold solid ice for over 6 days.",
      "This simple test monitored how well each cooler maintained cold temperatures and how quickly each reached equilibrium.",
      "Now most of you won't be out in the wild with a cooler with no access to replacement ice but if you were, be rest assured that the DAM25 is your No. 1 choice for a compact, well organized cooler to take to the outdoors.",
      "The SOFTCOOL15 is the smaller of our two soft coolers.",
      "The SOFTCOOL20 is the larger of our two soft coolers with some added mobility and some cool additional features:",
      "The demands of everyday calls for a durable backpack dedicated to just that.",
      "Our 2-in-1 Cooler Backpack is a combined 50+ liters of thoughtfully designed storage to keep you organized, and still be comfortable enough to wear on any commute.",
      "DAM Coolers was started in 2016 as an idea between a couple of crazy students who just wanted to get the best grade in a school project.\nOnce we got the idea, we knew that we had stumbled upon something BIG, such that before finishing we were already making real business plans.",
      "We gave it all we had, we even started gluing together stuff and 3D printing parts ourselves in our garage until we made our first prototype.",
      "Our first DAM Cooler performed so well that there was no turning back from that point on. We also got \"The Most Likely to Start a Business\" award, and did just that!\nWe started DAM Coolers, LLC and here we are today.",
      "The design and engineering for  our first two hard coolers are completed. This covers the 25 and 35 Quart Coolers. The 25 Quart cooler is farther along in the process however with the Mold Construction Fully completed today. We need only take delivery of our Molds and Tools at our factory and start full production. As a matter of fact we have received pre-production samples of the cooler from the Mold manufacturer only to have it undergo some Aesthetic and Quality updates. Today they are all completed, all 13 of them. Yes, 13. Because of our unique design every piece of our Hard Cooler was designed from ground up to assure performance and quality. This took time, but it greatly reduces our risk in the future.",
      "Speaking of risks, as with all crowdfunding projects there many involved. Project Design, Engineering Completion, Partner search and vetting, Manufacturing and Supply chain issues, you name it. All of these can make you a little nervous especially when you are making an advance payment. I personally order a lot from crowdfunding sites like indiegogo and kickstarter so I know what its like to wait 3 months for a new bike helmet or 8 months for a wrist watch to get to me. This is why I took a lot of the risk out of the whole experience for you. With the Molds hot and ready to make your coolers, the biggest risks I predict are the year \"2020\" and its shenanigans. Yes, you know what I mean. I won't even go there.",
      "So we started out with our DAM Coolers Hard V.I.P Coolers almost 5 years ago, and we spent most of the year promoting them for a Summer 2020 launch and delivery. Today we have in addition to the Hard Cooler, our SOFTCOOL Series of Soft Coolers and our 2-in-1 Backpack Cooler. These are not secondary products, they are our 'next thing' at DAM Coolers, but today we have them ready for you to pre-order also. \nAnother set of products with all the risk taken out of them for you. Design and Development is 100% done, and our factories are waiting to produce them for you.",
      "With everything noted, the risks are still there. Supply chain issues may persist with our suppliers and their global partners, but be assured that plans have been made in advance to ensure that they are as ready as feasible.",
      "Other risks include fulfillment. This includes everything from 'after our products have been manufactured, packaged and put at the factory door on the way to you'. We 'may' face similar issues that are faced today with existing supply lines. As FedEX, UPS, DHL and the rest are facing a near crisis mode with late and epileptic deliveries, so are the shipping lines.",
      "We have partnered with reputable fulfillment partners that will not only try to get your goods to you as fast as possible, they will also ensure that your goods are safe and secure, with their strategic stations all over the USA and the world.",
      "So, despite all the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic delays we have been able to push forward to get the the stage that we are now, even with multiple products on offer.",
      "Unlike other campaigns that want you to pay in advance for research and production we have taken risks and gone ahead with as much as we can. We did this because we believe our company and products and we don't want you to wait too long before you have your DAM Coolers.",
      "As mentioned earlier the our factories are primed and ready.",
      "I am a Systems and Industrial Engineer and I personally have 12 years of manufacturing experience from; Food processing, Food and Beverage manufacturing, Milling, Plastics, Aerospace, Automobile and Energy manufacturing operations, and I have worked in, lived in and visited places in China, India, UK, Nigeria, Colombia, and of course the good old USA, so I know most of all the issues that may arise and where to find a solution if I do not have it myself.",
      "We are Committed to the success of this project in its entirety and we have put extraordinary planning in place. If things do not go as planned, we pledge to you that we will communicate timely and transparently.",

      "Don't jeopardize your health. All light negatively affects your sleep quality",
      "According to a 2022 study\u00b9 conducted by Northwestern University, even moderate ambient lighting during sleep can adversely affect your health and well-being.",
      "Lack of sleep can cause the following and more:",
      "While blackout curtains can be effective at blocking out light from windows, they often leave gaps around the edges or at the top where light can still enter the room, especially if the curtains are not installed correctly and can lead to light leaking into the sleeping environment and disrupting sleep. Your cell phone, TV, digital clock, and bedside lamp are also light sources that you may not realize are negatively affecting your sleep quality.",
      "zDen, on the other hand, is designed to create a completely dark environment by surrounding the upper body with light-blocking material, which is specially designed to prevent any light from entering your sleep space.",
      "Get better sleep without spending more time in bed",
      "As many as 70 million Americans\u00b2 of all ages have sleep-related problems, and over 65 million suffer from conditions where light sensitivity is prevalent. Too much light in a sleeping environment prevents the body\u2019s natural production of melatonin which helps you fall asleep and can lead to mental and physical health issues.  Don't take sleep for granted! You need quality sleep to restore your body and mind each and every day.",
      "LISTEN! All light in your bedroom is bad for sleep",
      "Light can be a nuisance during your quest for rest... when you need to sleep during the day, your roommate is up late, a migraine strikes, illness sets in, or if travelling to different time zones. Fatigue, loss of focus, moodiness, decreased memory, and a weakened immune system are just a handful of the issues that can result from poor-quality sleep.",
      "Get an assist from zDen for higher quality sleep and naps / inemuri",

      "Are you ready to up your sleep game? Refresh your body and mind",
      "Sleeping well is just as important as eating well and exercising regularly. 7-8 hours of sleep\u2074, each night is essential for mental and physical health, but the quality of that sleep is just as crucial. zDen creates a dark to pitch dark environment which is ideal for high-quality sleeping\u2075. Now you can block light day or night, particularly if you suffer from a condition that increases your light sensitivity. zDen is also perfect for shared sleeping spaces and for night shift workers who need to sleep during the day. Sleep when you need it most, with zDen.",
      "Light sensitivity, migraines and zDen",
      "Light sensitivity affects 80% of people who suffer from migraines or have other neurological conditions\u2076. Light sensitivity makes it more difficult to rest or sleep, thus prolonging recovery time.",
      "Complementary to any regimen of medication you may have, zDen is ideal because it is non-invasive, blocking out light to relieve you of pain and discomfort associated with light sensitivity. While not a standalone solution, zDen offers a dark space where you can recover from headaches, migraines or any reaction/condition that may be aggravated by light. This drug-free complement does not replace the advice of your physician but can be used in conjunction with other prescribed medications or therapies recommended by your healthcare provider.",
      "zDen vs. Sleep Masks",
      "zDen and sleep masks both serve the purpose of blocking out light, but they are different products with different benefits.",
      "One of the main benefits of zDen over a sleep mask is that it provides a more comprehensive solution for creating a peaceful and nighttime dark, sleeping environment. While a sleep mask only blocks out light on your eyes, zDen creates an enclosed sleeping space that blocks light pollution from other sources in your bedroom.",
      "Additionally, zDen is designed to be spacious and comfortable, allowing you to move around freely while sleeping. In contrast, a sleep mask can sometimes feel restrictive or uncomfortable, especially if you're a side sleeper or move around a lot in your sleep.",
      "Finally, zDen is a non-tech, drug-free solution for improving sleep quality, whereas some sleep masks may be uncomfortable to wear or have uncomfortable pressure on your face, and others use electronic devices that may disrupt your sleep.",
      "Overall, zDen is a more comprehensive and comfortable solution for creating a peaceful sleeping environment compared to a sleep mask.",
      "Take it anywhere \u2014 Folds to 18\" diameter",

This period marked a \u201csynchronized international increase in rates of adolescent anxiety and depression.\u201d",

Instead of long strokes, the toothbrush should be gently wiggled with subtle vibrations.",

      "Hello INDIEGOGO, We are Orangered Life. When we create our designs, we use various tools-some basic, some advanced. In the midst of design work on others, the notebook came to our attention and we began to look at one of our most used tools in a new light. We believe life is best when simple things work.",

      "Improved Sleep Quality: By calming the mind and body, EVANES facilitates better sleep patterns, helping users achieve a deeper and more restful sleep.",
      "Enhanced Mood: Regular use of EVANES can uplift mood and promote a sense of well-being by reducing anxiety and promoting relaxation.",
      "Cognitive Clarity: EVANES not only soothes the body but also sharpens the mind, fostering mental clarity and focus, leading to improved cognitive function.",
      "Vagus Nerve is our tenth cranial nerve. It is now well known to control majority of our most important organs making it hugely important opportunity to enhance our wellbeing. Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) is an effective treatment to correct imbalance in the autonomic nervous system caused by excess stress.",
      "We know now that stress is either a cause or a contributory factor in over 85% of chronic diseases, especially those that increase as people age. Stress is reflected in people's daily lives, for example with sleep disturbances, anxiety and depression. Finding effective treatment for stress is a medical, economic and social challenge. VNS has been proven to be an effective treatment for stress.",
      "The vagus nerve plays a key role not only in stress, but a myriad of diseases such as depression, epilepsy, hearing loss, sleep problems, chronic pain, memory problems and digestive disorders.",
      "In the case of excess stress, the balance in the autonomic nervous system is upset and sympathetic overactivity (hyperarousal) develops, which in turn is treated by activating the parasympathetic system.",
      "Good parasympathetic activity is a prerequisite for well-being and health. For centuries, mankind has been aware of various breathing techniques and other means like yoga to achieve a response similar to parasympathetic activation. However, scientific evidence of their effectiveness is still lacking.",
      "Since the vagus nerve is responsible for parasympathetic function, and it's known that all of the messages it sends from the brain to our organs are bioelectric, electrical stimulation is an effective treatment for stress symptoms and therefore also promotes healthy ageing and supports the general wellbeing.",
      "Stress Reduction Through Advanced VNS: EVANES utilizes non-invasive electrical vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) to manage and reduce stress effectively. By activating the parasympathetic system, it helps restore balance to your central autonomic network, improving resilience against stress-induced health issues.",
      "Enter Your Flow State: Experience deeper focus and enhanced performance with EVANES. tVNS helps quiet the prefrontal cortex and activate brain areas responsible for skill execution and concentration. This advanced stimulation supports you in achieving a flow state, where productivity and creativity flourish.",
      "Simple, Safe, and Non-Invasive: With EVANES, embrace a simple, safe, and non-invasive method to stimulate your nervous system, encouraging a balanced and harmonious mental state conducive to both daily tasks and high-level performance.",
      "EVANES utilizes a sophisticated bio electricity, specifically engineered with the right amplitude, pulse width, and voltage, all designed to interact effectively with the nervous system. These signals are crafted to stimulate auricular branches of Vagus nerve, producing very fine electrical currents that activate the nerve without discomfort.",
      "This form of stimulation is congruent with the body's own mechanisms, as the Vagus nerve inherently uses electrical signals to communicate internally. EVANES offers a non-invasive approach to wellness, ensuring it is a safe option for managing stress and anxiety.",
      "EVANES is programmed to perform a unique skin contact test before treatment begins. This test ensures that the electric current is transmitted through the skin.",
      "Furthermore, EVANES's design and operation adhere to high standards of safety and efficacy, ensuring that it is a reliable and trustworthy tool for those seeking to improve their mental and physical well-being through nerve stimulation.",
      "Utilizing cutting-edge proprietary techniques such as algorithm driven signal and adaptive power control, EVANES' specialized designs are crafted to create peaceful experience. By integrating bio-electric modulation, these designs effectively harmonize natural body rhythms, significantly reducing stress levels.",

      "Our products have received patents, are regulated as homeopathic drugs by the FDA, and are recommended by doctors and healthcare professionals nationwide.",

      "We\u2019re crowdfunding because - we were caught in an unfortunate set of financial circumstances that has prevented us from supplying you (our loyal customers) with the best topical pain relief products available anywhere - but, we\u2019re choosing to rise\u2014with help from YOU, our committed, amazing community who wants and needs us to protect this very special product that has helped so many people over so many years.",

      "Those promises and commitments were not honored. What began as a growth deal turned into a stranglehold. Funding was withheld. Agreements were violated. And when we tried to clarify the nature of the relationship, and asked for promises and commitments to be honored, our partner tried to seize our assets and take control of the business.",
      "To protect Topricin\u2019s mission and end this untenable relationship, we filed for Chapter 11 restructuring. It was the only legal path to cancel a damaging IP agreement and remove an individual who had no intention of keeping their word.",

      "Topricin was created because we understand this. We\u2019ve seen how the right kind of relief\u2014safe, effective, natural\u2014can bring people back to themselves. It\u2019s like offering a Fountain of Youth solution for those lacking mobility and a pain-free existence. Our original formula was developed by a decorated Marine Corps veteran who refused to accept his diagnosis of CTS - Carpal Tunnel Syndrome - that prevented him from sleeping and functioning, so he found a solution for his own ailments.",
      "This campaign is for every person who struggles to feel like themselves again. It\u2019s for every person who\u2019s ever been told, \u201cYou\u2019ll just have to live with it.\u201d We\u2019re here to say: No. You don\u2019t. We\u2019ve got you.  And we're here to make your life better.",

      "Smart Projector with AI-Powered Storybook and Song Creation Platform",
      "Key features to help you DIY Fairy Tales, Bedtime stories, Picture book and even generate songs for your kids!",
      "With the Creator token, you can custom create your own content for your kids. You could also browse other works on our Story OS.",
      "IOS and Android App Available:",
      "Currently, hardware development has finished. We kicked off our First batch assembly:",
      "We have launched the IOS and Android App:",
      "The founders of Knock Knock Fairytales are a pair of Chinese high school brothers, Chris and Tony. Their initial intention for this project stemmed from an educational public welfare project that Chris and Tony participated in near their school.",
      "They found that the reason why many children from poor families wander the streets and idle around is actually the lack of good educational resources.",
      "\"The core concept of this project is not to charge for education. We hope that education can be as fair as possible, so that children can choose what kind of educational opportunities they want to receive.  With the possibly limited company of their parents, they can guide their own lives,\" said Chris Lai.",
      "Currently, Knock Knock Fairytales (Knock AI) has been launched on WeChat Mini Program, App Store, and Google Play, and users can use it for free. The app has accumulated over 100,000 readers in China and 2,000-3,000 registered active users.",
      "The app has also been downloaded over a thousand times in the US market. In terms of investment, the company has received RMB 3 million in financing, including a US$250,000 investment from Google Cloud.",
      "Let AI tell stories in just 3 minutes",
      "The Knock Knock AI Mini Program has set up two entrances for children and parents respectively. After selecting their identities, they will enter different operation modes:",
      "And at night, parents can also use a projector to project the story onto the ceiling and lie comfortably in bed with their children to enjoy bedtime. With the team's deeply adapted StoryOS and the hardware under development, the projected image can even spread to the entire room, allowing children to enter the fairy tale world they created themselves.",
      "\"The combination with the new hardware is not simply installing a software, but overturning the design of existing devices, re-adapting and scheduling the AI, making it easy for children to use, and ultimately presenting a new interactive mode different from projectors or TVs,\" said hardware designer Gao Ruotong.",
      "Compared to other AI education and companion products, what makes Knock Knock Fairytales unique as a storyteller lies in its \"intangibility.\" Zuo Dewei, the technical director of Knock Knock Fairytales, explained to Intelligent Emergence: \"Almost everyone has an imaginary friend in their growth. The key is not in the 'friend,' but in the 'imaginary'.\"",
      "He believes that many AI applications based on large models that give specific images to this imaginary friend will actually limit children's imagination. \"If I really give it a voice, an intelligence, it will suddenly become very creepy.\"",
      "On the contrary, they hope that AI can become a \"crutch\" for children's creativity, helping them to visualize their ideas one by one and preserve them in the form of personalized data for a long time, recording the growth of children's thinking and creativity.",
      "Secondly, due to the operation mechanism of existing large models based on probability prediction rather than actual understanding, the problem of \"hallucination\" (generating seemingly reasonable but actually inaccurate or completely fabricated information) cannot be avoided.",
      "To address this issue, Knock Knock Fairytales takes steps such as keyword shielding to ensure that the content is harmless to children's health, while allowing the AI to maintain maximum freedom in story creation. For example, when a character travels from point A to point B, Knock Knock Fairytales only makes the scene switching and the character's actions conform to the logic of the real world, rather than being limited to preset scenes and paths like game systems.",
      "\"The path of a character in a game is fixed, and the scene switching must be reasonable. In this case, it cannot complete too many steps through AI, and it must be controlled by humans. But we don't need to control AI, AI can fully utilize its full creative talent, we just have to let it not do anything.\"",
      "Finally, back to AI story creation itself, it is not easy for ordinary people to make large language models tell novel stories like fairy tale experts.",
      "On the one hand, this is due to the lack of prompt writing ability of ordinary people, who cannot fully guide the large model. On the other hand, it is because ordinary large models have not received enough high-quality fairy tale creation training, resulting in a small number of output content that meets expectations and low quality.",
      "In fact, the creation of fairy tales is very difficult in itself - an excellent children's story contains a complex structure, not only must be logical, full of plot, in line with children's cognitive and understanding level, but also full of imagination and freshness, both profound connotation and interpretability, so as to entertain and educate.",
      "This has also become a major difficulty in the development process of the Knock Knock Fairytales team.",
      "Faced with the problem of giving the AI Little Mermaid an \"immortal soul,\" the Knock Knock Fairytales creative team solved it this way:",
      "First, let the large language model undergo multiple rounds of deep training, and the training dataset consists of classic stories that have entered the public domain and children's stories, picture books, illustrations and other related content created by the creative team themselves.  The model learns many of the creative rules of children's stories and illustrations, forming a personality system that can imitate human creators.",
      "After that, the team designed and optimized the entire event flow from user demand to the final output of the picture book:",
      "After receiving the user's voice or text requirements, the large language model within Knock Knock Fairytales will first create a story skeleton based on the input variables, and then \"grow flesh\" based on the skeleton.",
      "These results are then processed by a deeply trained model for style adjustment and polishing, and finally form a text that can be converted into voice and illustrations, building a complete multimedia picture book experience for children. The team leader said that Knock Knock Fairytales will also launch a video function in the future to allow children to immerse themselves in the picture book story.",
      "It is worth mentioning that Knock Knock Fairytales has also launched a \"voice customization\" function that allows AI to tell stories to children on behalf of parents, supporting almost all mainstream languages.",
      "With just a sentence of voice from parents, Knock Knock Fairytales can use their voices to tell the stories created by their children, and in the beta version, parents can even independently voice the narration and characters of the story.",
      "This function will only appear in the storytelling session and will not cover all voice interaction scenarios in the app, avoiding the \"uncanny valley effect\" of AI saying unusual words in the parents' voices. In this way, the AI-created story is told through the mouths of the parents, which can add a bit more intimacy and \"human touch.\"",
      "Next, the Knock Knock Fairytales team will rapidly iterate on the product at the software and hardware levels.",
      "In the future, what Knock Knock Fairytales hopes to achieve is to allow every child to have their own personalized echo box to record their precious cornerstone memories - every imaginary friend in their childhood, every \"chuunibyo\" story, and every colorful unicorn that may be forgotten when they grow up.",

    "company_name": "Akuto Studio",
    "allParagraphs": [
      "New ways of playing chords",
      "We are Akuto, a studio based in Switzerland. We strive to put great design in service of music making. Many members of our team either make music themselves or have a close link to it and as you can guess, it is from our own struggles that the idea of the Chord Machine stems from. We hope you'll like it as much as we do. We kept what we think is  essential and crammed it inside this deceptively simple looking device. Enjoy discovering!",
      "The Chord Machine AKT-0.1 is an innovative MIDI controller designed for making chord progressions easy and fun to play as well as combining and tweaking effects, all within a compact and durable device. Designed to accompany you from the start of your musical journey and beyond, the Chord Machine will keep to evolving with new features that you will continue to use and explore in your productions.",
      "As a team, we are committed to push the boundaries of what is possible with the Chord Machine, and we have a lot of exciting ideas that we are eager to develop. By getting the Chord Machine, you are not only gaining access to its current features but also future updates that will provide even more ways to play and explore your creativity.",
      "Our goal is to provide endless inspiration for your music-making endeavours.",
      "The first thing you'll notice with the keyboard is that it is arranged in an isometric pattern. This allows us to achieve many things not possible on a regular piano keyboard. Let's dive into each aspect.",
      "The Chord Machine offers a revolutionary approach to note selection for chords and melodies, thanks to its intuitive grid-like system. With three keyboard modes to choose from, you can easily switch between different methods of note selection and unlock a whole new world of creative possibilities. Whether you're a seasoned musician or just starting out, the Chord Machine makes it easy to experiment, opening up new avenues for musical expression",
      "The Tonnetz mode is a powerful feature that sets the Chord Machine apart from other MIDI devices. By allowing you to visualise music in a completely new way.",
      "With the Tonnetz mode, each note is separated by a repeating interval in the same direction, enabling you to easily transpose chord shapes to different root notes. This means that even with just a few basic chord shapes, you have access to an entire library of chords that can be played in any key. With this unique feature, the Chord Machine empowers musicians to explore new sonic territory and create music that's truly their own.",
      "The Tonnetz mode is more than just playing chords. It simplifies and makes learning music theory more intuitive. Basic chord shapes can help you grasp the musical distance between two notes with just a glance at the grid. Even scales can be understood in the same way. For a complete understanding, we will provide a tutorial on how to use Tonnetz on our website and manual.",
      "With Accordion mode, you can concentrate on chord progressions as each key plays a complete chord. Switching from A minor to A major is as easy as pressing the key beneath it. And that's not all. You can play other chord types, such as major seventh and many many more.",
      "The Chord Machine offers a versatile array of playing modes, including the classic Piano mode.",
      "The Piano is the traditional layout we all know and you can have it on the Chord Machine. The black and white keys are represented by illuminated built-in LED's of the keyboard. Starting with 4 isometric rows, you get 2 continuously playable piano rows.",
      "We believe having these 3 modes allows you to work differently depending on where you are in the making process of a song and lets you have fresh eyes each time you get back in the only mode that matters: creative mode.",
      "To wrap up with the hardware design, our device features a square touchscreen that not only offers a new range of playing possibilities, but also adds nuanced control and provides valuable information to the user.",
      "You'll be able to see and change the keyboard mode or screen mode, know which chord or note you're playing and configure the playing field which is where all the fun happens. Let us see what the screen modes and playing field are and what they do.",
      "The playing field, defined by a circle and a dot in the middle, is where you can change the live effects of your sound and actually make the notes come out to your computer/DAW. The field can accommodate up to 4 effects.",
      "You can configure the placement and the range of each effect individually. For example an effect could go from 30% in the middle of the field all the way to 80% toward the edge. That's just half the story, next you have 3 screen modes you can choose from.",
      "Direct screen mode keeps things simple and allows you to slide your finger where you want without sending any notes. The latter will directly be generated as soon as you press a key.",
      "Bi-manual screen mode adds the possibility to select the notes with the keyboard and only make them sound once you touch the playing field. This puts you in the same mindset as guitar player.",
      "Strum screen mode pushes bi-manual mode further as the keys pressed are displayed as lines on the screen and can be finger picked or strummed. (It even got some people recalling some aspects of the legendary Omnichord from Suzuki which, in and of itself, makes our team very happy and proud!)",
      "All of this adds a lot of room for experimentation as you can combine between 3 keyboard modes, 3 screen modes and up to 4 effects. Hopefully, you don't have to remember it all, you can save up to 7 presets by holding both shift buttons and selecting one of the illuminated keys.",
      "Use the rotary knob to quickly navigate through semitones and the shift keys to jump through octaves. You can control the pitch to transpose any type of chord to your own voice or own liking and access a wide range of notes with a compact keyboard.",
      "By combining the shift and the rotary, you can also move your keyboard inside the Tonnetz grid and access more types of chords inside the accordion keyboard mode.",
      "Although asymmetrical, with a quick triple press on the rotary knob, the Chord Machine can be flipped 180\u00b0 to suit your preference. This action will make the user interface and the keyboard's LEDs flip horizontally as well as change the direction of the rotary knob and shift buttons.",
      "The Chord Machine Suite contains 1x MIDI keyboard 1x USB type C cable, 1x manual/poster, an optional MIDI-CV adapter and an early access to the Chord Studio web app beta. You'll be among the first to get a glimpse of the app and influence the development with your feedback.",
      "The Chord Machine is the centrepiece of our Suite. It is a quirky yet simple device that will adapt to your workflow or inspire you to try new ones. No matter your level, you'll find something you'll like in here.",
      "We know that many of you want to fully integrate the Chord Machine with your existing setup, which is why we've designed a USB-C to CV/MIDI adapter for this purpose.",
      "With this adapter, you can easily connect your Chord Machine to your favorite Synthesizer or any other CV/MIDI-compatible device, giving you even more options for creative expression. This adapter is an essential accessory for anyone looking to get the most out of their Chord Machine and we're happy to include it as part of our Suite rewards level.",
      "Here, we\u2019ve prepared something really special that you\u2019ll only be able to see for yourself once you receive it as we\u2019re sure you all like a little surprise. Our design team has put a lot of effort into this little piece that we\u2019re going to send it to you separately from the device so you can keep calm while we prepare the Chord Machine.",
      "We want you to enjoy playing chords instantly, nothing required. For that reason, we're developing a web app that you will be able access from any navigator so you can plug & play and start discovering the many features of the Chord Machine.",
      "When you support us through the Limited Edition or the Super Early Bird rewards, you'll get some nice perks! We will share with you the backstage of our project and you will be among the first to try out our specially designed web application for the Chord Machine.",
      "Note that even if you don't purchase the Chord Machine, the web application will still be available for anyone with an internet connection after its official release. We hope you'll try it for yourself and discover our digital vision of music making.",

      "In this prototype, we successfully verified its functionality. You can see there is an Arduino on the PCB. This prototype is mainly to test ideas. We took this picture 18 months ago. Jose machined all the metal parts using an old mill. So it's pretty rough.",
      "After we built the Functional Prototype, we made several versions of it. During this period, we completed the mechanical design and industrial design. After many assembly trials, we ordered the injection molds from the factory.This blue-green case is injection-molded. Since the mold was not polished at that time, it was a bit rough. During this period, we completed the PCB layout. The Atmel chip on the PCB has been replaced by ESP32.",
      "This is the DFM(Design for Manufacturing) Prototype. So far, we have completed the testing of injection molds and fixtures. And ordered the first batch of parts from suppliers. All the metal parts in this picture are produced by high-precision CNC machines.",
      "Like all innovative projects, we will face certain risks and challenges in delivering this product at the quality we demand of ourselves. We will work with multiple suppliers to complete the production of this product. A problem in the supply chain of any supplier could delay the entire production schedule. In that instance, we will work hard to push the solution and seek alternative sources.",
      "Shipping: Currently, international shipping volumes are relatively congested, which may result in longer shipping times. Of course, we will work with well-trained shipping companies to minimize shipping delays.",
      "TinyMaker is a product of lots of testing and research, and our team has been working on it for over two years. But no project is risk-free. If something goes wrong, we promise to keep our backers updated and informed about any issues and how we solve them.",

We already consider our bags environmentally conscious, as they contain less materials than other bags in their category and offset single use plastic bags. In addition, for each bag sold we\u2019ll plant one tree with Eden Reforestation. Trees are effective tools for removing carbon from the atmosphere. As an example, a mangrove tree can store up to 1750lbs (800kg) of CO2 over its growth life. As an added bonus trees also prevent soil erosion and help sustain ecosystems.",

This time we've managed to organize  EU friendly shipping (delivery duty paid) to the following countries: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, and Spain. All parcels will be shipped with tracked air mail.",

The Nanobag 6.0 has been developed and tested over the past few months and we are confident that we can do a good job with this. As with every project, there can always be unforeseen things along the way, but we've done our best to mitigate potential problems. Final products may differ slightly from the prototypes seen in the campaign as our bags are continually being developed and improved. Except stated otherwise please note that customers are responsible for taxes and duties that may be imposed on the shipments by their respective countries. We promise you that we're 100% committed to the project and that we\u2019ll keep you updated every step of the journey. Our goal is to satisfy every backer.",

      "Easiest way to consistently make great pour-over coffee, with less than 30 seconds hands-on time.",
      "An innovative coffee brewer design that revolutionizes the pour-over coffee brewing method. It uses ground coffee's natural tendency to swell in hot water to consistently get great coffee.",
      "This could be the biggest development in pour-over since Melitta Bentz started it all, over 100 years ago.",
      "Is it over for traditional pour-over?",
      "Definitely not! But it's fantastic to have a pour-over brewer that requires almost no time, special attention, or pouring technique.",
      "Your everyday pour-over brewer?",
      "Probably yes! It's the brewer you can rely on every morning to effortlessly make great coffee.",
      "Simplicity is beautiful! This thought drives us everyday.",
      "Making coffee should be simple. But it seems to be getting more complicated every year!",
      "If you love the ritual of a manual pour-over, watching a siphon brewer do its thing, or drinking a latte with a swan on it \u2026 that\u2019s cool.",
      "But we are about reconnecting with the beautiful simplicity of coffee \u2026 it\u2019s just ground coffee and hot water.",
      "We set out to make the simplest coffee brewer that gives the quality of an artisan brewed pour-over, with minimal effort and no special brewing or pouring technique. By using the natural swelling of ground coffee, and encapsulating it in a deceptively simple brewer, we achieved this.",
      "You will get great quality coffee - every time - with less than 30 seconds hands-on time.",
      "Because all the coffee is made uniformly wet at the same time, and because the coffee expands to close any possible channels as carbon dioxide bubbles escapes from the roasted coffee, there is no need to do a pre-infusion phase - often called the 'bloom'.",
      "CO2 bubbling up - no 'bloom' needed",
      "The carbon dioxide harmlessly bubbles through the water while the coffee is brewing - like a soda. There is no risk of uneven extraction caused by channel formation, because as the coffee expands it closes out any micro-channels that start to form.",
      "The brewer is carefully designed so that the amount of stainless steel is perfect for chilling freshly boiled water to get it in the range of 195\u00b0F to 205\u00b0F, as recommended by the National Coffee Association and the Specialty Coffee Association.",
      "This means there is no need to preheat the brewer. And you don't need a temperature-controlled kettle.",
      "With less effort than it takes to use a coffee machine, you will get great quality coffee with every brew.",
      "It's the Simple Smart Coffee Brewer (or SSC Brewer).",
      "We addressed the entire user experience during the design process. We looked at every detail. From use, to clean-up and storage we have ensured that the brewer is a delight to use.",
      "For instance, when you are adding coffee to the brewer you rest it on the lid, so that any coffee 'fines' that pass through the filter do not end up on your kitchen surfaces. And when you have finished the brew, you can rest the brewer on the lid to catch any coffee drips.",
      "Clean and easy to use",
      "Storage needs are minimal. If you have space for a cup, you have space for the brewer. It's perfect for use in a tight kitchen, an office, or a dorm.",
      "Minimal storage space",
      "Clean-up is a breeze. The brewer is dishwasher safe. But it's very simple to just rinse out and wipe dry.",
      "Simple clean up",
      "The robust design and small size mean that it is perfect to use as a travel brewer. Anywhere that you can get hot water, you can make great coffee!",
      "Easily transported and used anywhere",
      "Because you can easily use it anywhere, you can have one at home and one at the office, to ensure you can enjoy great coffee whether you're relaxing or working.",
      "Use at home and at work",
      "The packaging the brewer comes in is designed to be reused, which is convenient for storage and for transporting the brewer. Image below is a prototype.",
      "Reusable packaging for storage or travel use",
      "It really is the best way to get consistently great pour-over coffee with minimal effort. The perfect way to start your day.",
      "The easiest way to make pour-over coffee.",
      "If you put the in same amount of coffee, with the same grind size, you'll get the same cup of coffee every time. You do not need any skilled brewing or pouring technique.",
      "As you make the coffee one cup at a time, you can make it to suit individual tastes. If your partner likes  a strong, dark roast and you like a medium roast, a little less strong, that's no problem.",
      "If you select the SSC Brewer Partner Pack as a perk, you can both get coffee just the way you like it.",
      "Partner Pack Perk - Ideal for coffee loving couples",
      "The prime filter in the SSC Brewer is the coffee. The encapsulated coffee forms a uniformly dense and thin coffee bed as the coffee expands. This is perfect for getting an even brew.",
      "The laser cut holes in the brewer control the flow rate to give a well-balanced brew.",
      "It is designed to be used without any additional filters. But, if you want to, you can modify your coffee by adding secondary filters by using the Adaptor. This does not affect the extraction, which is only controlled by the brewer design and the coffee used. The exctration is completed before the brewed coffee touches a secondary filter.",
      "The Adaptor is also used to allow different coffee cup diameters to be used - up to 4\" outside diameter.",
      "You can use the 200 micron metal filter in the adaptor to remove more visible grounds.",
      "If you want to remove all the 'fines' and most of the coffee oils - that are extracted as emulsions rather than being dissolved in the water - you can use the small individual paper filters.",
      "Adaptor and optional metal or paper filters",
      "If your home grinder produces a lot of 'fines' you can add a tertiary (third) filter by simply stacking two adaptors with paper filters (you will need to purchase an additional adaptor for this). Too many 'fines' can cause the first paper filter to 'clog', which allows some coffee to pass through the air/overflow holes in the adaptor. The tertiary filter (the second paper filter) filters this 'pass-through' coffee to give the cleanest cup possible.",
      "Paper filters after using tertiary filter",
      "The 'clogging' of the first filter paper filter does not affect the quality of the coffee as is does with traditional pour-over, as the flow-rate is control by the stainless steel and coffee, not the paper filter.",
      "Whether you prefer the full, rounded, robust brew you get just using the coffee as a filter or the cleanest, brightest coffee from using two paper filters, you can get coffee just the way you like it.",
      "We set out to create a simpler, quicker, and more reliable way to get pour-over quality coffee. We did not set out to try to improve the taste of the coffee. But the testers we have been working with over the last 12 months, have often reported getting a 'better' cup of coffee. The most common comment is that it is less bitter.",
      "We have not done any rigorous and controlled testing, so we are not claiming you'll get a 'better' tasting cup of coffee. For a start, it depends what you are comparing it with. And there\u2019s also the possibility of confirmation bias playing a part. But we thought it appropriate to share this information and offer an explanation why you might experience a slightly different flavor profile compared to a traditional pour-over.",
      "We suspect the difference is to do with the coffee:water contact time. Even though the total brew time with the SSC Brewer is very similar to a traditional pour-over ... maybe a touch longer on average ...the water that sits above the filter plate does not mix with the coffee as is the case with a traditional pour-over. You can see below that the water is virtually clear.",
      "SSC Brewer with clear water above filter plate.",
      "Coffee/water slurry in traditional pour-over.",
      "The water is only in contact with the coffee as it passes through the shallow coffee bed (roughly 7mm thick) that is encapsulated between the filter plate and the filter body. This is normally about 30 seconds (in the 25 to 40 second range).",
      "As it takes longer for water to extract the bitter compounds from the coffee, this reduced contact time might be an explanation of the reported taste.",
      "Please note that this is our best hypothesis - not a proven fact.",
      "If you go ahead and start using the SSC Brewer, we'd love to get your feedback on the taste,",
      "The Simple Smart Coffee Brewer was designed so that you do not need any additional equipment to use it.",
      "You just need something to boil water in that you can pour into the brewer. A simple kettle is the obvious option.",
      "You certainly don't need to buy a special gooseneck or pouring kettle. Nor do you need a temperature-controlled kettle. You don't need scales or timers to measure the amount of water you have added.",
      "No need for pouring kettles",
      "Several people that have been testing the Simple Smart Coffee Brewer have stopped using typical drip coffee machines (or even French Presses). They found that they got better quality coffee from the SSC Brewer and it was easier to use.",
      "Also, they reported that there was no wasted coffee and the clean-up was far easier.",
      "It's important to note that the expected life-time of the SSC Brewer far exceeds the typical 5 to 10 years of a coffee machine.",
      "SSC Brewer much longer product life",
      "As the coffee is made directly into the cup, there is no need for any carafe that needs to be cleaned and stored.",
      "The SSC Brewer has a deceptively simple design, But there are many points of detail that have been incorporated into the design - such as having the silicone components act as protection whilst shipping.",
      "Here are a few illustrations of this attention to detail.",
      "Positioned to control flow-rate and, therefore, extraction.",
      "To create tight fit between plate and body.",
      "To allow air to enter the filter body as it drains.",
      "To ensure air can escape from cup as coffee flows in.",
      "Prevents spillage if fines choke paper filter & prevents seal with cup.",
      "To ensure lid stays cool for lifting filter.",
      "Our guiding principle of 'simplicity' significantly affects our design approach.",
      "We believe it is a simpler experience for the user if they never have to replace the product, or any of its parts. So, this is one of the reasons we work to create products that 'Strive to be Immortal'.",
      "We have used materials that should not degrade and become unusable over decades. We have used food grade silicone and 304 Stainless Steel. Both materials are expected to last decades.",
      "We have not used any plastics in the product. To be clear, silicone is not a plastic. It is a synthetic polymer of silicon, oxygen, hydrogen, and - in food grade silicone - carbon. Importantly, it does not breakdown into microplastics.",
      "There are no pressure seals, that always eventually require replacing during a product's life.",
      "We have designed out as many points of potential failure as we could. This is why the lid also acts as a 'handle' to lift the brewer when hot, if needed.",
      "There is only one manufactured joint- where the handle is triple-welded to the filter plate.",
      "We only provide the silicone in a brown color. Coffee will stain silicone over years of use, so we selected the color it would end up after years of exposure to coffee oils.",
      "To keep our business simple (we apply the same simplicity principle to our operations) we do not offer a warranty on the SSC Brewer.  We will, of course, honor any return policy of any sales channels we use.",
      "The design is such to make any warranty of negligible value to customers, given the modest price of the brewer and the incredibly low probability of any issues arising over any reasonable warranty period.",
      "Our policy is to do individual quality assurance on every brewer before it is ships from our facility in the USA.",
      "Concern about the environment is the second reason we work towards products that 'Strive to be immortal'.",
      "There are many positive environmental points to consider about the SSC Brewer:",
      "Given the environmental benefits, it is clear that there are costs savings associated with selecting the Simple Smart Coffee Brewer. Compared to traditional pour-over, typically,",
      "Single Use Coffee Machine",
      "If you use a machine that uses pods or k-cups, the annual savings can be quite significant.",
      "For instance, a couple that uses k-cups, with both drinking 2 to 3 cups of coffee a day each, would save about $600 a year by switching to the Simple Smart Coffee Brewer. That's just of coffee cost! (Based on price of Peets Major Dickason's Blend - prices as taken from Amazon August 2024 - K-cup $0.64 each, loose pre-ground $0.78 per ounce. SSC Brewer typically uses 0.4 oz per cup of this coffee, so saving per cup is 32,8 cents. At 5 cups of coffee per day for a year this equates to $598.60.)",
      "And you'll get a better tasting cup of coffee!",
      "The stainless steel components are production versions made on molds that are ready for a full mass production run, This is also the case with the silicone lid.",
      "Through rigorous testing  over the last year plus, we developed a better design for the Adaptor that can accommodate more cup internal diameters and manage issues associated with 'fines' in the ground coffee. We will be keeping the same overall dimensions, but changing the air/liquid flow paths. This will have no impact on the production schedule.",
      "The only other open issue we have is to finalize the packaging design, which again, will have no impact on the production timescales.",
      "We asses that the main risks associated with this project are related to logistics. This is one of the reasons we have decided to undertake an Indiegogo launch with shipping to the USA only.",
      "The other two reasons for this are:",
      "We expect to be shipping the first perks to our backers in November/December 2024.",
      "Update 11/4/24 - the estimated delivery date is now January 2025.",
      "Once we have reached the funding target we will be able to share more precise dates.",

      "By Co-funder Tommy Nielsen",
      "Inspiration and Start. My need for something like the Sandwizz\u00ae Breadboard started many years ago. For 32 years in my professional career as an electronic engineer and 10 years before that as an electronics maker, I focused on making things easier and frequently worked on new inventions. My experience taught me the importance of quickly creating mockups to illustrate the concept behind an idea. Drawings, schematics, and 3D CAD models on the computer screen often weren't sufficient to convey ideas to others. Therefore, it became crucial to create something tangible quickly to test and refine the idea. Life has taught me the importance of failing fast and learning by doing. This doesn't mean I don't enjoy studying theory and engaging in deep creative thoughts, but it's only when we try out these theories and ideas that we truly understand them. At the same time, we also discover what's missing in our mindset.",
      "My Summer vacation in Spain 2023. I did enjoy the good food and the nice sun, but my mind was with the Sandwizz Breadboard a lot.",
      "Early Experiments. Between 2015 and 2018, I was involved in developing a new product through an innovation and technological phase in my previous job. It reminded me again of the importance of tools for quick mockup creation, which we partly lacked at that time. In early 2019, while organizing my workshop at home, I found an old yellowed breadboard from my student days and became inspired. Holding this breadboard in one hand and a modern development board in the other, I envisioned the Sandwizz\u00ae Breadboard: a contemporary breadboard with integrated components and intelligence for both analog and digital connections.",
      "The 35-year-old breadboard from my student days. Besides being yellowed, nothing has really changed in breadboards in all that time.",
      "Experimental Mockup. In early 2021, I began researching breadboards that were easier to solder. After some experiments, I ordered a prototype breadboard and built a mockup to illustrate the concept. Even with all the wires that are so typical of a traditional  breadboard mockup, the prototype demonstrated that signals could be effectively routed to specific components and connections.",
      "The first mockup of the Sandwizz Breadboard concept was created using a traditional breadboard, the new solderable breadboard modules, a protoboard, and a couple of evaluation kits for the system-on-chip that I wanted to use. It's a great example of how to use existing tools to create the next generation of a tool in the same category.",
      "Initiating Sandwizz\u00ae Breadboard. After a busy period at work, the idea resurfaced in January 2023. Inspired by what I would have wanted as a young engineer and by the goal of helping the younger generation, the Sandwizz\u00ae Breadboard was developed. I worked many hours after work, creating the first real version of the Sandwizz\u00ae Breadboard. I took a course on Udemy to learn about the KiCad E-CAD software, as I saw it as the perfect choice for a first platform that would be part of the Sandwizz\u00ae concept. Additionally, I wanted to refresh my skills in schematics and PCB layout from my earlier days, as I would need those updated skills to create the Sandwizz\u00ae Breadboard. This way, I also took my own medicine, the one I would prescribe as a first choice for those working with the concept in the future.",

      "The Sandwizz\u00ae Breadboard has undergone several iterations. Not only has the color changed, but elements have also been added to ensure a higher robustness in the design.",
      "Testing the Idea, and Finding a Co-Founder. My close and most trusted colleagues and friends confirmed the value of the idea, and in the summer of 2023, I shared the concept with Ren\u00e9. He immediately recognized its potential and became the co-founder of Microaware\u00ae. Together, we worked hard on the business plan for Microaware, and in late autumn 2023, we signed the agreement for our new joint company. I would work full-time, and Ren\u00e9 would be the advisor in his spare time. We quickly concluded that Kickstarter would be the perfect platform to launch our Sandwizz\u00ae Breadboard concept. It is a platform frequently visited by the younger generation, which is also our target audience, including DIY makers and students. Furthermore, it is an international platform, which Sandwizz\u00ae needs to grow, as the Danish domestic market, although sizable, could easily become too niche-focused for such a product.",
      "Ren\u00e9 and Tommy shake hands after signing the contract to found Microaware.",
      "Business Establishment and Development. Microaware\u00ae was officially established on February 1st, with a hardware release candidate for the Sandwizz\u00ae Breadboard ready for testing. While the product's hardware needed testing for robustness, the firmware was still under development. Throughout the Kickstarter campaign and beyond, we planned to optimize the algorithm for accurate component placement to ensure seamless implementation once the hardware is fully produced.",
      "The release candidate of the Sandwizz Breadboard hardware. Here, an application is demonstrated with a Class B amplifier, including an LED VU meter, test tone generator, volume potentiometer, and USB stream interface for music.",
      "Presentation and Future Plans. Despite being just a two-person team, our combined experience in business management, innovation, and electronics design has enabled us to create the Sandwizz\u00ae Breadboard from a home office. Even before the official launch of the company, we dedicated countless hours to developing the business and the concept, investing much more time than one might expect for a company that officially began in February 2024. The product was presented at Embedded World 2024 in Nuremberg, where it attracted considerable interest. With Kickstarter, we aim to reach a broader audience that can recognize the potential for more efficient electronics development. We believe that once the right people see the Sandwizz\u00ae Breadboard, they'll appreciate how it can effectively transform ideas into practice.",

      "The next flagship model from Germany is more than an evolution. It is a revolution. It is the world's first smartphone with an integrated, optional cloud that no longer needs a data center. Instead, it is created from networked smartphones\u2014the perfect combination of convenience and security.",
      "Hier geht es zur deutschsprachigen Projektbeschreibung:",
      "The Volla Phone Quintus takes our promise of freedom through simplicity and security to a new level without compromising on hardware. The extra-large display with borderless sides and brilliant brightness and color gamut meets a powerful Dimensity processor and a triple camera with up to native 50 megapixels, packaged in the sleek design and elegant piano lacquer look of a lightweight.",
      "Today's smartphones demand a lot of time and attention. They are designed for this, because time and attention mean more engagement and more usable data for Big Tech. And the evaluation of data enables influence and control. What happens to which data is not determined by the user, especially when smartphones are inextricably linked to iCloud and Google Cloud?",
      "It's time for something new! The Volla Phone Quintus with Volla OS. The Google-free Android enables time and attention for the things that are important to us and self-determination of our data through an intelligent user interface with a refreshingly clear design and unique security features. The concept is simple: the focus is on people and content instead of countless apps and functions.",
      "The Volla Phone Quintus meets the highest demands in terms of features, performance and design, combined with a promise of durability and longevity with long-term system updates.",
      "7 sensors (Light and Proximity, G-sensor, E-Compass, Battery Health, Fingerprint, NFC, Gyroscope)",

      "The Volla Phone 22 is already powerful for all everyday functions. But the Volla Phone Quintus offers a significant improvement:",
      "The Volla Phone Quintus comes with either Volla OS or the mobile Linux distribution Ubuntu Touch. Volla OS is based on the Android Open Source Project and is also open source and published on the popular GitHub platform.",
      "With Android, the wide world of Android apps is open to you. In the Aurora Store, you will find all apps from the Google Play Store that you can install securely and anonymously, while the F-Droid Store offers open-source alternatives for many everyday applications.",
      "And if an app that you need privately or for study and work requires Google Play services, simply activate microG, which simulates the former and establishes the connection to Google services.",
      "The uncluttered Volla Home Screen breathes freedom through simplicity for a clear head. This simplicity is full of possibilities for your everyday life.",
      "The smartphone that understands you.",
      "Start writing, and the Volla Phone Quintus guesses your intention and suggests completion and appropriate actions. Get live weather results or knowledge from Wikipedia. And if you don't have a free hand, simply speak to your Volla Phone Quintus.",
      "Iconographic and powerful at the same time. With a single gesture, you can call up all the important functions of your everyday life via the red dot. Be it the camera, upcoming appointments, your most essential apps and websites, or one of the intelligent content compilations, just as you need it.",
      "Volla OS automatically and dynamically compiles for you your recent contacts with whom you were last in touch by call or message, your recent conversations, whether SMS, Signal, or Volla Messages, your recent messages, your subscribed news channels, or your notes, the most important ones pinned at the top. You can navigate directly to a message or read an exciting article in a streamlined, reader-friendly view without having to open an app. That is the concept of Volla OS. People and content take center stage.",
      "Of course, Volla OS also knows the classic app view, optionally also as the start view. Volla OS can group the apps automatically. The apps that you have used most recently appear first, so you can quickly find what you need if you have a lot of apps installed. Apps can also be grouped by categories, such as games and messengers.",
      "The clean, minimalist design is reflected in the eye-friendly black and white icons and text. Choose between the dark mode for indoors or the fresh mode for outdoor activities, or bring color into your life with the transparent mode with glass effect.",
      "We think artificial intelligence can be useful. But what it does must be transparent; it should not patronize users and certainly not infiltrate their privacy. That's why Volla OS takes a different approach and relies on supportive intelligence that always empowers the user instead of disempowering them.",
      "Not only is the springboard a kind of supportive intelligence, but it also integrates speech recognition and speech synthesis, which also enables accessibility. Maximum security is provided by biometric access blocking of the device through facial recognition. What all these processes have in common is that they are open source, and not a single bit goes into the cloud.",
      "For many users, the appeal of Apple and Google smartphones is not least due to the convenience of iCloud or Google Cloud. However, it's not just emails, images, and videos that are stored in Big Tech's data centers, but also internet activity, movement profiles, and personal contacts that we give away.",
      "They are accessible to the data center operators and evaluated there. In many countries, operators are also obliged to enable monitoring.",
      "The optional Volla Cloud gives the power back to the users. Your data belongs to you. Period. Because the Volla Cloud does not require a data center. Instead, networked Volla Phones form the cloud. You decide with whom you share highly encrypted data.",
      "The Volla Cloud is based on Holochain technology. It is not a blockchain, but rather a technology that adopts the best concepts while overcoming the disadvantages. Holochain uses a chain of transactions that is shared and protects the data from manipulation, but only between trusted peers rather than globally. This makes the system more lightweight and also saves a considerable amount of resources and energy. At the same time, it also enables data to be securely deleted again. This is not possible with a blockchain and inevitably leads to data overflow.",
      "The Volla Cloud forms the foundation for a new ecosystem of apps and services\u2014the perfection of convenience and security. Two basic apps for your everyday life are the start.",
      "With the Volla Messages app, you can connect with contacts with a confirmed identity for 1-to-1 conversations or with multiple contacts. You can also invite people to moderated groups using a passcode. Volla Messages is a WhatsApp, Signal, and Telegram alternative in terms of function. And yet more. Because you don't have to register with your phone number or share your messages via a service in a data center.",
      "Volla Messages is convenient and secure at the same time. After the ability to exchange text messages, images, videos and files, audio and video calls will follow.",
      "The app will also be available for macOS, Windows and dLinux so that you can stay in touch with all your friends and important people in your life.",
      "Back up all the data on your smartphone bit by bit with Recovery. The app is so intelligent that it starts with the most important data, such as your contacts, so that the performance and battery consumption of your Volla Phone Quintus is not affected, and you still gain security quickly.",
      "If your Volla Phone Quintus is lost or damaged, you can restore your data to a new smartphone from the Volla Distributed Cloud. You decide which trusted peers store your distributed and encrypted backup. It could be your family or team or even your own PC. It is also planned to be able to restore data that you have accidentally deleted, or to swap it out if the internal memory is no longer sufficient.",
      "With the Volla Phone Quintus, you decide who you want to share which data with and when. That's why Volla OS is free of Google services. You do not need to open a Volla account for the Volla Phone Quintus.",
      "To create full transparency, we have published the source code of Volla OS. It is based on the Android Open Source project with numerous extensions and replaced, curated system apps that do exactly what they are intended to do.",
      "The Volla Phone Quintus allows you to configure and activate a special operating mode.",
      "Volla OS includes an optional Hide.me virtual private network to protect your Internet connections from third parties who record and analyze your activity, such as your mobile service provider. With worldwide access points, the VPN can even help anonymize your connection.",
      "Hide.me is characterized by a special, particularly secure encryption method and a strict log-free connection. Internet activity is not recorded.",

      "Ubuntu Touch is already prepared for convergence. If you connect a display via Miracast wireless standard as well as a keyboard and mouse, you can use your Volla Phone Quintus like a PC. The new flagship model delivers enough power effortlessly.",
      "Multi Boot for all those who want to be inspired",
      "Volla OS offers the unique possibility to use several operating systems from the same smartphone. The installation of an additional operating system such as Ubuntu Touch is simply the installation of an app. For the first time, this is possible with the Volla Phone Quints on the internal memory, so that the second operating system runs just as smoothly as the first.",
      "Freedom is also freedom of choice. Experience unlimited freedom and try something new. The second operating system is also ideal for anyone who wants to make a strict distinction between private and professional use. Decide which operating system you want to use every time you start your device.",

      "Welcome, dear backers, when you enter this page, I think you will be attracted by this metal gadget that looks like a seahorse, of course, it is certainly not a metal seahorse model, it is a collection of a wrench, pry bar, bottle opener, screwdriver bit, ratchet mechanism, window breaker, and multi-functional EDC tools. Please stop by for a few minutes and listen to our story.",
      "I think most people had some experience. When the screws on your favorite mountain bike come loose, you want a wrench to tighten it, when you need to open the tin and open a bottle of beer to celebrate with your friends, you hope to have a pry bar and a bottle opener in your pocket, and you need a window breaker to take you out of trouble in an emergency.",
      "But our pockets are small and limited, even a backpack can't be filled with all kinds of bulky tools, so a pocket tool that combines multiple functions with one is especially important, and that's why we designed this titanium multifunctional wrench pry bar in the first place.",
      "Well, let's see what powerful functions this little seahorse tool can perform!",
      "The 6-in-1 functional design is a highly integrated design concept, the core of which is to achieve multiple functions through a single product, thus greatly enhancing the practicality and convenience of life. This design concept can be widely used in a variety of life scenarios, helping to make your toolbox lighter and more compact, bringing unprecedented convenience.",
      "Adjustable wrench, is undoubtedly a frequent appearance in daily life of the \"Omnipotent Little Helper\", its wide range of applications, across the furniture assembly to every corner of electrical maintenance, all highlight its indispensable importance.",
      "It is especially worth mentioning that the rows of grooves at the opening of the wrench are like precision teeth, which not only give the wrench extraordinary anti-slip performance, but also ensure that it can achieve a tight bite with the bolt or nut in any working environment, so as to easily and stably complete the task of tightening or disassembly. It not only improves the work efficiency, but also ensures the safety of the operation, so that every operation is more handy and gets twice the result with half the effort.",
      "You can open the wrench by flicking the roller to the left with your finger. You can adjust the size at any time according to your actual needs. After use, you can pull the wrench back by flicking the roller to the right in the same way.",
      "The maximum opening size of the wrench is 18mm, which can meet more than 90% of your needs in daily life. Its total unfolding length reaches 152mm/6in. This indicates the extraordinary strength contained within. The super-long torque is undoubtedly the perfect combination of strength and efficiency, it is like a powerful assistant, so that you can easily resolve in the face of a variety of complex problems.",
      "Under the wrench, a multi-functional V-shaped pry bar is integrated, which can also be called the all-purpose nail puller. It not only gives it the ease of pulling out nails, but also the ease of opening cans and lifting daily heavy objects. Its flat edge design allows it to cut through cans and disassemble delivery boxes quickly and neatly.",

      "The end of the wrench is equipped with a window breaker made of tungsten steel to assist in emergency evacuation. It is integrated with the wrench, has high hardness, easy to break the glass. It's also smooth and won't hurt your fingers. You don't have to worry about safety.",
      "Both sides of the product are designed with 5 tritium slots which can be used to install tritium tubes, which not only enhances the technology and fashion of the product, but also makes it easier for you to locate and find it quickly in the dark. We offer five tritium tube colors to choose from (green, purple, yellow, blue, and red,), you can choose your favorite style to make it look more unique",
      "We also offer luminous vials as an additional option. Luminous vials make light by absorbing light. They can be charged under a bright light source and will glow in the dark for some time. This option is generally less expensive than tritium tubes and may be suitable for those who do not need constant glow or are looking for a cost-effective option. However, the brightness and duration of light depend on the amount and intensity of light absorbed.",
      "On the head of the wrench, there is a specially designed string hole, which makes it extremely convenient for you to easily hang it on your keychain, mountaineering buckle or hiking bag. At the same time, it also effectively avoids any damage or injury that may be caused by accidentally dropping it while walking, running or performing other activities.",
      "This multifunctional pry bar is 134mm/5.3in, which is no bigger than the palm of an adult's hand, and fully meets daily carry needs. Whether it's for home repairs, a friend's party, or an outdoor adventure, it can easily fit in your pocket or backpack and serve you at any time.",
      "When faced with complex maintenance work and feeling stressed, a cleverly designed wrench can not only serve as a practical tool, but also unexpectedly become a stress-relieving and relaxing little toy.",
      "By flicking the wheel of the wrench back and forth, you can feel a sense of rhythm and rhythmic beauty of mechanical movement. This simple operation is often distracting and allows one to temporarily take a break from tedious maintenance work, achieving a relaxing and stress-relieving effect.",
      "Of course, if you like to frequently take the screwdriver head out of its storage slot and put it back in again, that's totally your freedom, as long as you're happy.",
      "This wrench has a very unique streamlined design, incorporating geometric patterns and serrated shapes on the appearance, as well as carefully designed concave and convex surfaces, making it look very fashionable and technological. The use of these elements not only breaks the monotonous and dull image of traditional tools, but also makes people shine through the visual impact and layering.",
      "Would you want a unique and personalized \"Pry Bar\"? We offer personalized service by engraving letters or words on the tool.",
      "You can only receive this service when you purchase custom carving separately. We offer three fonts for you to choose from, and you will choose the font in the subsequent survey and provide content for custom engraving.",
      "The Pry Bar is made of the highest quality Gr5 titanium, which  gives it a range of superior performance characteristics",
      "The CNC process has been widely used in the modern manufacturing industry by virtue of its remarkable features of high precision, high efficiency, and high consistency. Therefore, the entire machining process of the pry bar adopts the CNC process, which ensures that the machining accuracy of each batch of products is maintained at a very high level through the precise control of the computer program, thus realizing the stability and reliability of product quality.",

      "The Multi-Celled Beverage Corporation aims to manufacture the first round of marketable juice boxes",
      "Three ingredient cocktails!  Three kinds of juices for kiddies!  Pierce the rooms at the bottom, blend to desired proportion and drink.   The Multi-Celled Beverage Container\u00ae, patented in more than 100 countries, has a huge potential to breakthru into the global beverage industry.  As the CEO, I hope to raise the necessary money to be able to work with a manufacturing firm in China to bring this innovation to the market.",
      "The Multi-Celled Beverage Container is opening eyes to beverage manufacturers in China, as this never before seen product has quickly garnered attention and is being appraised as a really good idea with a huge long-term market potential.  I have met a liaison to the beverage manufacturers in China who has invited me to China to formally negotiate the innovation with a few manufacturers.   Realistically, as a new machine is needed to build this juice container, I will need to raise a hundred thousand dollars to bridge a business partnership with a willing beverage company.   The Multi-Celled Beverage Corporation needs to invest together with a willing Chinese firm in order to build the final stage filling, closing and sealing juice box machine.   If I am unable to raise such funding, the best I could hope to do is to sell the patent.  The financial backing is required for the MCBC to pay its side of the investment for the adaptation of the machine: and so the cooperation of engineers and managers will be required to adapt the existing tetra-pak juice box delivery system to be able to complete the manufacture of the Multi-Celled Beverage Container.   On top of this, there will be legal fees to pay for.",
      "Here are the stages of Multi-Celled Beverage Container manufacture.  Three of four are already in place:  1) The 500ml Housing Juice Box Container can be created by existing technology.  2) The dual-polyethylene-coated-aluminum sided inner rooms, 200 ml per, each filled with a unique kind of juice, can be created by existing technology.  The dual-aluminum-sided materials can be acquired.  3) The 200 ml rooms will be dipped in peach resin, an odorless, flavorless and edible substance used for healthy skin in China, and then placed by hand into the housing container.  The peach resin will help the rooms stick to the bottom of the container.  It is also possible that a robotic arm be employed to this purpose.  4) Innovation is required to fill the open space above the two rooms at the top of the Housing Container, with a third juice, and then to close and seal the Housing Container that has the two juice rooms already inside it.",
      "The standard between foreign companies in China is a 50/50 investment arrangement and so this is sought between the Multi-Celled Beverage Corporation and a willing corporation.  My wife, from Suzhou, and I, literate in Chinese, have been aggressive in pitching this innovation and are hopeful to meet with the leaders of such beverage manufacturing companies whose interest has been sparked.",
      "As a memento  of gratitude, contributions of 200$ or more will be met with an authentic MCBC t-shirt.   Or, perhaps shares in the potentially lucrative corporation would interest you.",
      "The fruit juice beverage industry is growing worldwide and the convenience of a mixable alcoholic beverage is on the horizon. The Multi-Celled Beverage Corporation is keen to deliver the goods.",

Our latest innovation, the 25\u00b0 Ruler, builds upon the success of our 30\u00b0 Ruler, which was supported by 40,000+ enthusiasts. We've refined its angle for enhanced ergonomics and improved stability. Tailored for versatility, choose from 5 sizes and 5 colors.",
      "The 25\u00b0 Ruler marks a significant advancement in ergonomic design, featuring a revolutionary 25\u00b0 slope that positions measurement marks at the bottom edge, unlike traditional rulers. This innovative approach ensures that you don't need to lean over to read or use the ruler, allowing you to keep your back straight and your eyes focused directly on your work, enhancing both comfort and accuracy.",
      "With its unique slope, the 25\u00b0 Ruler is not only easier to grasp but also ensures safer cutting by keeping your hands away from the blade's path. This design choice significantly reduces the risk of accidents while providing a more stable and secure measuring tool.",

      "Precision is key, so every tick mark on the 25\u00b0 Ruler is labeled. Whether you're using metric or imperial measurements, you'll find no guesswork here\u2014just accuracy at every glance.",
      "The 25\u00b0 Ruler starts at zero, eliminating any unnecessary blank space. This means you can measure from the very edge, ensuring accuracy and simplicity right from the start.",
      "The 25\u00b0 Ruler is meticulously crafted from aerospace-grade aluminum, ensuring not only unmatched precision but also remarkable durability. Lightweight yet robust, it's designed for lasting reliability. Enhanced with laser-engraved markings, this ruler promises enduring clarity and resilience against wear and tear, making it an essential tool that remains as dependable and readable as on day one.",

      "See what our satisfied backers have to say! Here's a glimpse into the glowing reviews and heartfelt endorsements from users who've experienced the precision and quality of our 30\u00b0 Ruler. Their stories highlight the difference our ruler has made in their projects and lives.",
      "From the Depths of Our Hearts",
      "We're beyond grateful for the overwhelming support from our Indiegogo community. Your enthusiasm and faith in our vision have paved the way for the 25\u00b0 Ruler. Each pledge, share, and word of encouragement has been a cornerstone of our journey.

By introduction of proprietary shape in the key ring hole (Key Connector), we're able to develop add-on tools that will be available in the near future. We have an example phillips bit below that showcases how it will be utilized. We're just scratching its surface and we believe we can further introduce wide range of functionalities that will make MyKee 2.0 very unique.

      "We are a team with a shared goal - a mission to create unique products that stand out to challenge the incumbent tech companies, and to make a worldwide difference with top-notch technology.\n\nWe started our journey in wearables by first launching the world's first payments enabled hybrid smartwatch on Kickstarter.\n\nOur payments feature was live in 28 countries including UK, EU and India.During Covid, we understood the need of the hour and developed India\u2019s first comprehensive health tracker, which measured 5 crucial health vitals including Blood oxygen levels.\n\nDeploying it in multiple hospitals, 1000+ patient beds and saving hundreds of lives with timely alerts for oxygen requirements helped us to truly understand the profound impact technology can have on our lives.\n\nThese experiences came with a couple of important learnings. We realised that the readings from the finger were far more reliable than those from the wrist and that a wrist worn device was not comfortable to wear all night and all day.\n\nThis gave us the idea for Ring One. We married findings from the health tracking with the learnings from payments feature of our first hybrid smartwatch and came up with something which we believe is truly path breaking - the Ring One.",

We've rigorously tested them on over 4000 individuals, ensuring they meet the highest standards of accuracy and reliability.\n\nContactless Payments Integration: Our experience with launching contactless payments in wearables for the second time puts us in a strong position. We've fine-tuned the process to ensure a smooth, global rollout. However in some countries, all banks might not be integrated from Day 1, but we will bring them on board in a phase wise manner.\n\nManufacturing:  We've forged a strong partnership with a seasoned contract manufacturer with decades of experience in electronic product assembly. Their expertise will help ensure the smooth production of our smart ring.\n\n While we launch our campaign with confidence, we remain vigilant. We've taken steps to identify potential challenges and have strategies in place to address them swiftly. Our commitment to transparency means you'll always be informed of our progress and any challenges we face.",

      "30\u00b0 ruler that\u2019s practical and beautiful,balanced and stable,and durable enough to last a lifetime.",
      "Hi, We are Orangered Life. Back today with our sixth 30\u00b0 ruler campaign, the solid brass version! To date, we have successfully created and fulfilled five 30\u00b0 Ruler campaigns. Our products are enjoyed by thousands of people across the world.",
      "We believe life is best when simple things work\u2026",
      "When we create our designs, we use various tools-some basic, some advanced. While working on another design we realised the humble ruler could do with an upgrade.",
      "Sometimes all it takes is one great idea to revolutionize a product. For the 30\u00b0 Ruler, it was a simple elevation. By lifting the slope on the ruler\u2019s face by 30\u00b0, we\u2019ve made it easier to use, and we\u2019ve expanded its usage. It\u2019s simple but effective \u2013 that\u2019s what Orangered Life is all about.",
      "With a 30\u00b0 slope, you can read the measurements from a glance without having to lean over to use the device. This means a switch from a tilted neck to a tilted ruler - keeping your back straight and your eyes on the prize...",
      "The elevation also makes it easy to grab.  It might not seem like a big deal, but not having to scratch your ruler across a table or dig it up with your nails is actually super helpful. The angled slope and metallic finish also make it safer and more practical as a cutting guide.",
      "Eternal materials - 30\u00b0 Ruler is made from solid brass and comes in high-quality chrome finish. It makes the surface of the ruler rust and corrosion resistant.",
      "Also the chrome finish 30\u00b0 Ruler has a super slick texture and again makes the numerals easy to read. It also boasts a non reflective surface that makes it easier to use that other metallic rulers.",
      "Balance and Stability - The 30\u00b0 Ruler is an heirloom quality tool and practically indestructible. Hefty and delicate at the same time, this well-balanced tool feels good in your hands and is so easy to use you can even use it with one hand\uff01",
      "Apart from its signature sloped design, the 30\u00b0 Ruler also has a couple of new features.",
      "One material, two colours, three sizes",
      "The scale of the ruler is laser engraved to prevent scratches from external forces. The time-honoured material of brass is enduring and when you pass your 30\u00b0 Ruler on to the next generation, they\u2019ll find it just as easy to read and use as you did.",
      "This 2-in-1 ruler has millimetres and centimetres on one side, and inches on the reverse. We've labelled them in the same direction allowing for easy conversions.",
      "The 30\u00b0 Ruler starts at zero. It is another simple design feature meaning you can start measuring from the very edge of the ruler instead of having to adjust for a useless blank space in front of the laser engraved measurements.",
      "The 30\u00b0 Ruler is designed to eliminate the confusion and strain of reading your typical ruler, so every measurement is labelled.",
      "The 30\u00b0 Ruler is made from solid brass and comes in two different colours and three sizes.  Size S (15 CM/6 INCH), Size M (20 CM/8 INCH), Size L (30 CM/12 INCH).",
      "We love sharing our passion for our ruler and our other projects\u2026",
      "Through Indiegogo, we cordially invite you to share our journey and the manufacturing process. We are passionate about what we do, and the opportunity to serve you and bring such a fantastic product to market has been an incredible adventure.",

      "Hi, Kickstarters! We've been standing by too long, watching ideas get exhibited, projects funded, and miracles created. We're excited to unveil our latest creation: JOAT - the ultimate multifunction titanium EDC tool. Meticulously designed with passion and expertise, this compact tool is crafted from grade 5 titanium, and it guarantees durability for your daily adventures. Boasting over six features seamlessly integrated into its sleek design, the JOAT ensures you're equipped for any situation\u2014 Jack of all trades, master of them all.",
      "Whether you are a minimalist who loves to carry as simple as possible or a survival guy who prefers to get prepared all the time, you'll love this compact and mighty multitool designed for the broadest range of uses.",
      "1X JOAT= 6 General Utility Tools",
      "As office workers who love all kinds of outdoor activities, we need a tool that addresses the common challenge of carrying multiple gadgets, and we believe you do, too. More importantly, it must be legit to carry anywhere we go. So, we combined various functions into a modular sandwich-structured tool that streamlines daily life, eliminating the need for bulky items. Small but mighty, JOAT is the magic in the pocket that enhances efficiency and convenience.",
      "Joat is crafted by CNC machining from grade 5 titanium material. These two factors are just the guarantee of the quality of the finished product. The repeated tests ensure the degree of completion of the design. What's shown here are the results of our original design effort, quality materials, CNC machining techniques, and patience poured into this one unit. It's resistant to almost everything you'll see in common: rust, corrosion, acid, and base; they are nothing challenging at all.",
      "Built-in Mini Knife with Scalpel Blade",
      "How often do you find yourself in need of a knife to open a box, cut ropes, sharpen a pencil, remove labels from a new cloth, etc? But it is not always legitimate to bring your folding knives everywhere. With the JOAT, you don't have to worry about it. The built-in knife uses a super sharp mini scalpel blade. You may not be able to cook a meal with it, but other than that, it covers 80% of knife-related usage on ordinary days.",
      "The quick-release blade holder design allows you to change the blades in just less than one second. You can simply remove the blade if you are taking a flight or going somewhere the security is tight.",
      "When the blade gets dull and stained, pull out the blade and insert a brand-new one. Then you get a super sharp scalpel knife that is as good as new.",
      "Is the screw loose, and the machine is making a strange noise? Good! We've got you covered. And don't worry about dropping your bits at all. Four strong magnets and the cover plates won't let that happen.",
      "Screws, nuts, and bolts, not one less. You'll need a small handy wrench to deal with them for gripping, fastening, turning, tightening, and loosening things like pipe fittings, nuts, and bolts. Please don't underestimate the strength of the wrench due to its shape. For nuts on tripods, bicycles, etc, use it however you want, and you won't have any problems.",
      "How about a drink after a day of heavy work? You don't drink beer very often, but it doesn't harm to have one in case you need it some time. If you see someone in need of it, it may be so much better to take your JOAT out than ask, why bring a drink but not a bottle opener? It's a great conversation starter, too.",
      "But even if you are not an enthusiast, having a small pry bar/ nail remover on your keychains can be very useful.",
      "Why is it so different from any other multitools?",
      "---- The pleasure of FULLY disassembling every part by yourself",
      "It gives you the most freedom to proceed or step back. If you want it all, it's a compact, versatile multitool that does it all. In those days, you want nothing outside of you except for your keys; you can break it down entirely to a quality shackle to which you can attach all your keys.",
      "JOAT utilizes titanium, ensuring exceptional durability and longevity. The stonewashed and bead blast finish stands the test of time. The smooth finish also reduces the need for frequent replacements. Just like us, JOAT promotes a more eco-friendly lifestyle. All you need to replace is the blade that gets dull after you use it without any hesitation.",
      "Are you taking your JOAT on a flight with you? Not a problem! Despite the sharp blade and the complex components, it's TSA-compliant. Just smoothly pull the blade off, discard it, and keep the handle with you; you are good to go. It's no doubt the perfect travel companion for all your creative needs. The new blades are accessible everywhere, and you can also get a 10X pack here. It's available as an add-on.",
      "We are excited to offer free worldwide shipping to all our backers. With this perk, you can have your Bolt-action Pen delivered to your doorstep without any extra charges. We aim to provide a seamless and hassle-free experience, allowing you to fully enjoy your Bolt-action Pen without incurring additional costs.",
      "The tritium tube groove is very suitable for decoration and also for quick positioning of knives/keychains in the dark. Okay, we offer two instead of one.\nThe tritium tube is placed on both sides of the shackle (marked in red). We added them to Shackle because they always exist and tools can be removed at any time no matter what happens. So you can always see tritium tubes on JOAT tools.",
      "2.You may also notice that the connection of the titanium plate has changed from upward to a side opening with wire cut springs. Therefore, even if you jump or swing the tool very hard (even on a centrifuge, LOL), the tool will remain in place.",

      "Preserve the flavor and aroma of coffee beans by continuously\nkeeping the vacuum state inside of the container.\nGenerally, 20kPa vacuum pressure is considered a decent power for preservation. The coffee genie maintains vacuum pressure from 30kPa to 40kPa, maximizing the reduction of contact with oxygen to slow the oxidation of coffee.\n\n\nThe coffee genie will make a sound If the container is not properly vacuum sealed.\nYou don't have to worry every time if it is preserving the beans properly or not.",
      "Just pour it in the Coffee Genie and keep it fresh for up to 6 months!",

      "Coffee Genie monitors the condition of coffee beans all the time. \nDepending on the number of times you open the lid, the fresh condition of coffee beans may vary. Coffee Genie shows the storage period and how long you can preserve the coffee beans through a digital bar on the lid every time you open it. The storage period is maintained until reset.\n\n\nCoffee Genie has a large capacity (850ml) to store roasted beans.\nIt can preserve about 330g with beans and 350g with shredded beans.",

As DHL will be the ONLY option as of now shipping cost maybe fairly high, we will keep you updated once this has been resolved.",
      "XKidea originally started from the idea of a capsule for tea. As tea is extremely sensitive to the environment, flavor and taste can easily deteriorate without proper preservation. When we developed a storage capsule for tea for the first time, we also thought that such an idea may apply to coffee for serious coffee lovers. We have changed the design, size, and few features to suit to preserve coffee beans. We hope you enjoy your coffee in the best condition all time with our Coffee Genie.\n\nThank you.",

      "My journey to hospitality has been a crazy ride. I mean, who knew that slinging spuds would ultimately lead me to become a creator of some pretty amazing and widely-loved Airbnbs? Certainly not me, but hey, life is full of surprises. \n\nAlong the way, I've discovered the thrill of solving problems, the beauty of a minimalist approach, and the satisfaction that comes with a thriving career in hospitality.  \n\nWorking in a potato factory in Boise, Idaho, was a defining chapter in my life. Despite the long hours and modest wages, I cherish the memories of that time. It allowed me to develop my problem-solving skills and ignited my love for efficiency. \n\nBeyond the factory walls, I embarked on a journey of minimalism, building a modest \"shack on wheels\" alongside my mother. It was an experiment in embracing a simpler lifestyle, and it cost us a mere $3,000. Little did I know that this venture would lay the foundation for my future endeavors.\n\nWith sheer determination and practically every penny I had saved, I acquired a half-acre plot in Hawaii's Fern Forest through an unconventional Craigslist purchase. This plot of land became the canvas for my first-ever Airbnb property\u2014a 230-square-foot tropical treehouse.  \n\nWhen the Hawaiian retreat turned into a hit, I thought to myself: why to stop there? I brought the enchanting world of hobbits to life in Chelan, Washington, with an underground hobbit hole. This whimsical creation quickly became the most wish-listed Airbnb property in the state. The increasing demand for unique stays on Airbnb affirmed my belief that people were seeking extraordinary experiences, and I was thrilled to deliver them.\n\nReturning to my home state of Idaho, I set my sights on a rural fire lookout tower surrounded by 13 acres of awe-inspiring forest. Despite its initial challenges, including a rat infestation, I transformed it into the Crystal Peak Lookout\u2014a haven of tranquility featuring a sauna, wood-burning stove, and a meticulously restored 1964 Thikol Snowcat. \n\nHowever, it was my collaboration with the Idaho Potato Commission that truly skyrocketed my Airbnb journey. They graciously bestowed upon me a massive six-ton concrete potato, which I ingeniously transformed into the iconic Big Idaho Potato Hotel. \nToday, I am excited to introduce you to my newest idea\u2014the MoonPass Lookouts,  located in the majestic Sawtooth Mountains of Idaho. This secluded mountain retreat is sure to become your go-to destination for a weekend escape.\n\nMy journey from potatoes to palaces has been nothing short of incredible, and I am grateful for every step along the way. My love and respect for hospitality continue to grow, and I hope to share that enthusiasm with the world through my work.",

      "A few years ago, I was a software engineer in Silicon Valley\u2014long hours, junk food, and little sleep were my norm. It wasn\u2019t until a routine health check flagged high uric acid and other warning signs that I had to pause and rethink: What\u2019s the point of success if I\u2019m too unhealthy to enjoy it?",
      "I tried everything\u2014fitness trackers, health apps, different diets\u2014but nothing stuck. Most wearables just collected data without real guidance. Coincidentally, my expertise was in time-series data insights, the same type of data our bodies generate daily. I realized that beneath those raw numbers lay valuable health patterns\u2014ones that could drive real change if interpreted correctly.",
      "At the same time, a few close friends with backgrounds in psychology and health management shared the same frustration. We came together with a vision: to create a seamless, science-backed way to build better health habits. That\u2019s how Omni Health was born.",
      "For the past two years, we\u2019ve been perfecting the Omni Health Ring\u2014an ultra-thin, ultra-narrow, and ultra-light smart ring designed for all-day comfort. Why? Because long-term, continuous tracking is what truly matters. But unlike typical wearables, this isn\u2019t just about monitoring.

      "I have made a decision. Things are going to change for the better. I am done with living in scarcity, working my ass off and finding it is not working. I am done with having to scrape by, being constantly busy, and still not having enough.",
      "That\u2019s why I have started this crowdfunding. To get financially healthy. But as the project is evolving, it\u2019s becoming much more: A way to reconnect with the ones I love, a way to build a sustainable future for myself beyond the crowdfunding, and a way for me to take back control and realise my dreams.",
      "I am asking you, my family, friends, and network, to help me:",
      "By reconnecting. Just talking already means a lot to me. I love getting feedback on what I am doing, as two know more than one",
      "By sharing my crowdfunding. Really taking some time to check out what I can do and share this crowdfunding with people you know who will benefit from my skills. Connect directly with them and talk about these opportunities.",
      "By sharing the crowdfunding in groups and on social media.",
      "By getting one of my products directly and working on a project together.",
      "Three years ago, I left my safe and steady PR job for a freelance career and ever since, I have been struggling to make ends meet. It turns out freelancing is a lot more challenging for me than I thought and although work has been coming in and I am busy all the time, I still miss the consistency necessary to really stay out of trouble.",
      "At the moment, I have four great projects that I am working on with a lot of potential, but they just won\u2019t materialise fast enough.",
      "I am working in regenerative business on lead generation with my business partner, Sajni, for our company called Kholo. We specialise in building organisations that actually take care of their employees instead of their bottom line, which is actually good for their bottom line in the long run. We help organisations like Cambridge to take the next step.",
      "I am working for a good friend who is building a change agency called Capacit\u00b3y, helping companies prepare for growth internally and implementing the most effective growth strategies to reach their goals. Also in a regenerative fashion.",
      "I am working with a PR software company called PR.co to build a workshop and consultancy service to help companies tell their story effectively to the right audience and make the most out of the software they make.",
      "And in music, I am working for a Web3 music streaming service called TraXs, built by SmartLabel in the Netherlands. They are putting the artist first while building amazing products that will change how we listen and appreciate music.",
      "The overarching theme here is that all of these projects have amazing potential, but none of them are making enough money at the moment. This will come at some point. Just not now.",
      "I can\u2019t just sit around and wait for them to start making money. I am taking control over my situation, and that\u2019s why you\u2019re reading this story. Why I started this project. And why I need your help.",
      "Normally, crowdfunding is to gather a big group of people to give a small sum of money and it\u2019s a way to fund projects. And yes, that\u2019s the case here too, but it is so much more than that. Besides the financial side, it\u2019s a way for me to reconnect to you, the people I love, and meet new people. It\u2019s a way to tell everyone that I am in (financial) trouble and I am asking for help to get out of it.",
      "Since I started the project and sent out the first email to friends and family, I have had countless conversations and responses. Because I don\u2019t just want to ask for money. I want to show everyone how I am doing and be fully transparent in sharing my story. And the responses have been heartwarming! I have already received backing from people I haven\u2019t talked to in a long time and I had amazing feedback. I am deeply touched by that.",
      "So this is not your average crowdfunding; it\u2019s a way to connect with friends and family and feel the warmth and strength of the community I have built throughout the years. Through living in Portugal and meeting friends here, through my music, through the projects I have done, and all the other ways I have struck a chord with.",
      "Another way this is not your average crowdfunding is that this is a lead generator. I have a massive network of amazing people who have their own network, unleashing huge potential that up until now I had no idea how to tap into. Taking a few minutes to share this crowdfunding on your socials helps. Attentively sharing what I can do with the right people in your network can prove the difference between struggling and an abundance of opportunities. When we jump on a call, we can really dig deep on what\u2019s possible and I am happy to help you identify who those people are in your network that need what I can offer.",
      "When we are constantly on the verge of not having money, that stresses us out. And when we experience stress, that messes with the brain\u2019s capacity to think clearly. That\u2019s why poor people make questionable decisions with money. Not because they are stupid and deserve to be poor, but because their situation doesn\u2019t allow them to think clearly enough and so they end up in a downward spiral.",
      "That\u2019s me at the start of this project.",
      "So first of all, the money will relieve the stress and give me peace of mind to think more clearly and being more effective in everything I do. Second, I need to pay off debt with loved ones around me and tax and social security payment backlogs. It\u2019s over \u20ac20k at the moment. And then, I am finally able to invest in myself and my dreams.",
      "The truth for me is that I don\u2019t need to pay my debts and can get around without having the money I need to stay afloat every month. I am doing great at the moment, but, over time, I have been slowly, almost unnoticeably, drowning by neglecting some of my less essential needs, hoping the tax collector won\u2019t come to hard on me, and cutting deals and corners where I can, sometimes with devastating impact on my mental health, making me struggle even more. Yes, the spiral is vicious.",
      "When the crowdfunding starts rolling, the most important debts are paid, and I can finally take a breather again after three years, I\u2019ll be focusing on taking good care of myself and building my dreams.",
      "Music is my first love and I have been tinkering with it since I was a little kid. Music has always been a means to meet people and travel. I started the band last year and it\u2019s time to invest in my music and take my endeavours to the next level. I have eight people in the band now who are eager to build with me. Having money will remove the boundaries that I set for myself and will enable me to spread more music while being able to push harder and take more risks.",
      "Secondly, I want to invest in regenerative business. This is the way to build a better future for everyone on this planet. My business partner Sajni put me on this path and together, I plan to follow it through until the end. Having money will give me peace of mind and time to build the company mindfully and find the most effective ways to make businesses more regenerative.",
      "Thirdly, I am looking forward to seeing what I am capable of when I am not constantly limiting myself financially and having to scrape by. When I don\u2019t have to rethink every euro I spend because there is abundance and to see how it opens up my mind when the financial stress dies down. When I can take proper care of myself and not just cover the basics. To see the actual potential within me come out and to be able to share that with the people around me.",
      "A beautiful by-product of this crowdfunding is a sort of formalisation of my community, a tangible overview of the people I love and who care about me. Because this won\u2019t end. Ever. This will go on indefinitely. Long past reaching my funding goal. This will be a growing community that I will keep up-to-date with my newsletter, where I\u2019ll share how this project evolves over time to celebrate the wins, share the setbacks, and become a hub that will enable me to share and help others.",
      "You\u2019re investing in me, obviously, but you\u2019re also investing in a philosophy. A future that is more human-centric, that focuses on trust, and connectedness through the art of regenerative business.",
      "What does this mean?",
      "Everything I do, I approach with the view that everything is interconnected and part of a bigger system, something that should contribute to the well-being of people, communities, and the planet. My work is grounded in principles of regeneration: fostering cultures of purpose, adaptability, and care for each other and what we do and leaving things better than we find them. Where systems are put in place that don\u2019t deplete resources but actually grow and make them better over time.",
      "I support teams in becoming more regenerative by making them more self-managed, connected, and aligned with their deeper purpose, so the business itself becomes a force for personal growth and starts spreading positive energy. When the people in an organisation thrive, the organisation can\u2019t do anything other than thrive itself too.",
      "And so all the products I sell are infused with this idea and no matter what we do together, you\u2019ll get a healthy dose of regenerative business energy to take your endeavours to the next level.",
      "The best way to support the project is to directly buy one of the products here on the right. That immediately brings in money and gives us a clear direction on how to work together. The sooner the better, as you\u2019ll be in front of the queue when it comes to realising the project.",
      "Also, by jumping on a call with me. Use this link to set up an hour meeting, or call me directly, and I\u2019ll tell you all about the campaign. You\u2019ll get the full lowdown on how I am doing, how the project is going, and we get a chance to see each other, to hear how you are doing. To connect. To help each other. As much as we can.",
      "Lastly, by taking the time to understand the products that I can offer and giving some thought to who in your network would greatly benefit from my services. I know we\u2019re all very busy but giving this your undivided attention and sharing this with, say, three people in your network, can make all the difference.",
      "With music, for instance, I am looking for people who organise music events and need DJs and people who manage artists to take the next step. An introduction would be amazing!",
      "When you buy a product. We\u2019ll have a call or meet in person, where possible. Again, this is all about connection. We align expectations and make sure we are both happy with where it\u2019s heading and, ultimately, the results. I am committed to making this a success and clear communication is key. Once a product is confirmed, it will enter a pipeline to track progress and to make sure nothing falls through the cracks. If at any point you have questions, reach out to me at info@guyvankoolwijk.nl",
      "Also, you see companies added to products. These are companies of close friends that have the knowledge and infrastructure to scale up these products or support products in various ways. I lean on them as a network of professionals, so when I may run into my limits, that doesn\u2019t mean that projects have to wait for me to continue going and grow.",
      "NEDERLANDSE TEKST",
      "Ik heb een beslissing genomen. Er moet iets veranderen. Ik ben klaar met niet genoeg geld hebben, met mezelf kapotwerken en er achter komen dat ik toch niet genoeg heb om rond te komen. Ik ben het zat om altijd druk te zijn en toch langzaam weg te zakken in schulden.",
      "Daarom ben ik deze crowdfunding gestart. Om weer financieel gezond te worden. Maar wat begonnen is als een crowdfunding ontwikkelt zich in iets dat veel groter is dan dat: een manier om de banden aan te halen met de mensen van wie ik hou, een manier om een duurzame toekomst voor mezelf op te bouwen na de crowdfunding, een manier om grip te krijgen op mijn leven en mijn dromen te verwezelijken.",
      "Ik vraag jou, mijn familie, vrienden en iedereen in mijn netwerk om me te helpen:",
      "Door een keer goed bij te praten. Dat is me al heel waardevol. Ik ben benieuwd hoe het met je gaat en naar je feedback.",

      "Door de crowdfunding te delen in groepen en op sociale media.",
      "Door direct een product van mij af te nemen en samen een project te starten.",
      "Drie jaar geleden heb ik mijn veilige PR-baan opgezegd om als freelancer aan de slag te gaan en sindsdien is het strijden om rond te komen. Freelancen blijkt voor mij een stuk uitdagender dan gedacht. Hoewel ik genoeg werk heb en ik constant bezig ben, mis ik de consistentie die nodig is om echt uit de financi\u00eble problemen te blijven.",
      "Op dit moment ben ik betrokoken bij vier geweldige projecten met ontzettend veel potentie waar ik echt in geloof, maar er komt gewoon nog niet genoeg geld van binnen:",
      "Ik doe een project samen met mijn zakenpartner Sajni en haar bedrijf Kholo waarbij we organisaties zoals Cambridge helpen zich meer regeneratief te organiseren (ik vertel verderop wat dit inhoud). Waarbij ze de werknemers centraal stellen, niet de winst. Iets dat op lange termijn juist weer goed is voor de winst. En de planeet.",
      "Ik werk voor een goede vriend die een change agency aan het bouwen is. We helpen bedrijven zich intern voor te bereiden op groei en de juiste strategie\u00ebn te implementeren om die groeien te realiseren. Ook dit met een regeneratieve aanpak.",
      "Ik werk samen met het PR-softwarebedrijf PR.co om hun klanten te helpen met workshops en consultancy zodat die hun verhaal beter kunnen vertellen aan het juiste publiek.",
      "In de muziek werk ik voor Web3 muziekstreamingdienst TraXs, gebouwd door SmartLabel in Nederland. Ze zetten de artiest voorop en bouwen producten die onze manier van muziek luisteren fundamenteel zullen veranderen.",
      "De rode draad: al deze projecten hebben enorm veel potentie, maar leveren op dit moment nog niet genoeg op. Dat komt zeker. Maar nu nog niet.",
      "En nu ben ik op een punt gekomen dat ik niet kan blijven wachten tot een van deze projecten geld op gaat leveren. Ik moet het heft in eigen handen nemen. Daarom lees je dit verhaal. Daarom ben ik dit project begonnen. Daarom heb ik jouw hulp nodig.",
      "Normaal gesproken is crowdfunding een manier om veel mensen een klein bedrag te laten doneren om een project te financieren. Dat is hier ook zo, maar het is veel meer dan dat. Naast de financi\u00eble kant is dit namelijk een manier voor mij om de banden aan te halen met jou \u2014 met de mensen van wie ik hou \u2014 en om nieuwe mensen te ontmoeten. Het is een manier om openlijk te zeggen dat ik in de (financi\u00eble) problemen zit en hulp nodig heb.",
      "Sinds ik het project ben gestart en de eerste mail eruit gedaan heb naar vrienden en familie om het project uit te leggen, heb ik veel gesprekken en reacties gehad. Ik vraag namelijk niet zomaar om geld. Ik wil laten zien hoe het echt met me gaat en volledig transparant zijn over waarom ik dit doe. En de reacties zijn hartverwarmend. Ik heb de eerste producten al verkocht aan mensen met wie ik niet heel vaak contact heb en ik krijg geweldige feedback. Dat raakt me diep.",
      "Dit is dus niet zomaar een crowdfunding. Het is een manier om de kracht en warmte te voelen van de gemeenschap die ik door de jaren heen heb opgebouwd, in Nederland, in Portugal, met de muziek, met de projecten die ik heb gedaan en op alle andere manieren waarop ik mensen heb geraakt.",
      "Een ander groot verschil is dat dit ook een manier is om nieuw werk te vinden. Ik heb een enorm netwerk van geweldige mensen, die op hun beurt weer hun eigen netwerk hebben. Dat is een bron waar ik tot nu toe niet precies van wist hoe ik die kon inzetten.",
      "Als je een paar minuten de tijd neemt om dit project op je socials te delen helpt al enorm. Dit project gericht delen met mensen in jouw netwerk kan het verschil maken tussen nauwelijks overleven of een overvloed aan werk. Laten we bellen en samen uitzoeken wie in jouw netwerk echt iets aan mijn diensten heeft.",
      "Constant net niet genoeg geld hebben is ontzettend stressvol. En stress vermindert ons vermogen om helder na te denken. Daarom maken mensen met weinig geld soms twijfelachtige financi\u00eble beslissingen. Niet omdat ze dom zijn, maar omdat hun situatie hen mentaal uitput en ze simpelweg de gevolgen niet goed kunnen overzien.",
      "Dat ben ik. Aan het begin van dit project.",
      "Het geld is dus als eerste bedoelt om stress weg te nemen en me ruimte te geven om helder na te kunnen denken en effectiever te handelen. Daarnaast wil ik zo snel mogelijk mijn schulden aflossen. Dat bedrag ligt nu net boven de \u20ac20.000 en dat vreet me op. Als daar schot in zit kan ik eindelijk investeren in mezelf en in mijn dromen.",
      "De harde waarheid is dat ik al een tijd langzaam, bijna onmerkbaar, aan het verdrinken ben in schulden. Het gaat op dit moment heel goed met me, maar door telkens wat minder voor mezelf te zorgen, te hopen dat de belastingdienst me lang genoeg met rust laat en links en rechts dealtjes te sluiten die soms verkeerd lopen met grote impact op mijn mentale gezondheid. Het is niet fijn.",
      "Zodra de crowdfunding op gang komt, de belangrijkste schulden zijn afgelost en ik na drie jaar eindelijk op adem kan komen, gaat de focus naar mezelf en mijn dromen.",
      "Muziek is de rode draad in mijn leven. Van jongs af aan ben ik er al druk mee. Muziek zorgt ervoor dat ik mensen leer kennen en Europa afreis. Vorig jaar is daar de band bijgekomen en het is nu tijd om te investeren en mijn muziek naar een hoger niveau te tillen. De band staat klaar om mee te bouwen. Met geld verdwijnen de beperkingen die ik mezelf opgelegd heb en kan ik harder groeien door meer risico te nemen.",
      "Daarnaast wil ik investeren in regeneratief ondernemen. Dit is de weg vooruit naar een mooiere samenleving. Mijn zakenpartner Sajni heeft me de ogen geopend en ik ben super gemotiveerd om hier verder in te groeien. Met geld heb ik de rust om de tijd te nemen om ons bedrijf zorgvuldig verder op te bouwen.",
      "Tot slot ben ik benieuwd wat ik kan bereiken als ik mezelf niet langer financieel hoef te beperken. Als ik niet elk dubbeltje hoef om te draaien en er meer mentale ruimte ontstaat. Dan kan ik echt goed voor mezelf zorgen en niet alleen de basis dekken. Dan kan mijn ware potentieel naar boven komen. Iets wat ik graag met iedereen wil ik delen.",
      "Een mooi bijproduct van deze crowdfunding is een soort formele bevestiging van mijn community. Een tastbaar overzicht van de belangrijkste mensen in mijn leven. Want dit stopt niet als de funding binnen is. Dit blijft groeien en blijf iedereen op de hoogte houden via mijn nieuwsbrief, waarin ik de ontwikkelingen zal blijven delen \u2014 successen, tegenslagen en alles daartussen.",
      "In mij, uiteraard. Maar ook in een filosofie. In een toekomst die menselijker is, gebouwd op vertrouwen en verbondenheid, mogelijk gemaakt door de idee\u00ebn achter regeneratief ondernemen.",
      "Wat houdt dit in?",
      "Alles wat ik doe zie ik als onderdeel van een groter geheel dat invloed heeft op wat we doen. De verhalen die ik vertel met PR bijvoorbeeld zijn onderdeel van een groter geheel dat die verhalen weer be\u00efnvloed. Werk moet bijdragen aan het welzijn van mensen en de omgeving. Mijn werk is daarmee gebaseerd op principes van regeneratie: projecten moeten energie geven, de samenwerking moet meer opleveren dan afzonderlijk bewerkstelligd zou kunnen worden, culturen cre\u00ebren die echt een doel hebben, zich moeiteloos aan passen en zorgzaam zijn voor hun omgeving. Dingen beter achterlaten dan we ze gevonden hebben. Systemen ontwerpen die niet kaalroven, maar alles juist laten groeien.",
      "Ik help teams regeneratiever te worden door autonomie te stimuleren, connectie tussen mensen te vergroten en ze in contact te brengen met hun persoonlijke diepere motivaties. Dan wordt een bedrijf een plek voor persoonlijke groei. En als het met de mensen goed gaat, volgen bedrijven vanzelf.",
      "Dus alles wat ik aanbied is doordrenkt met deze visie. Wat we ook samen doen, je krijgt een flinke dosis goede, regeneratieve, energie mee.",
      "De beste manier om het project te steunen is door direct een product hier rechts af te nemen. Dat levert me direct geld op en geeft ons richting voor een mooi project. Wees er snel bij want als de rij langer wordt sta je niet achteraan.",
      "Daarnaast: Laten we bellen. Gebruik deze link om een uur in mijn kalender vrij te maken of bel me direct. Dan vertel ik je alles over dit project, hoe het met me gaat en ik kan horen hoe het met jou gaat. Zodat we de banden aanhalen en elkaar kunnen helpen.",
      "Tot slot waardeer ik het enorm als je tijd neemt om mijn producten goed te bekijken en nadenkt over wie in jouw netwerk met me zou willen samenwerken. We zijn allemaal druk, maar als je hier je aandacht aan geeft en dit met bijvoorbeeld drie mensen deelt, kan dat al alles veranderen.",
      "Met muziek bijvoorbeeld zou je me waanzinnig helpen als je me kan introduceren aan boekers en promoters van muziek festivals en venues. Ik ben ook op zoek naar artiesten managers om te spreken en te kijken hoe ik de band en Space Kadett naar een hoger plan kan tillen.",
      "Als je een product koopt beginnen we met een goed gesprek. Verbinding staat centraal. We stemmen de verwachtingen goed af en zorgen ervoor dat we allebei blij zijn met de richting en het beoogde resultaat. Ik ben vastberaden dit tot een succes te maken en heldere communicatie is daarbij cruciaal. Zodra een product is bevestigd komt het in mijn systeem te staan om voortgang te volgen en niets over het hoofd te zien.",
      "Heb je vragen? Mail me gerust op info@guyvankoolwijk.nl.",
      "Bij sommige producten staan bedrijven vermeld. Dit zijn bedrijven van goede vrienden met de kennis en infrastructuur om deze producten op te schalen of op andere manieren te ondersteunen. Ik leun op dit professionele netwerk, zodat projecten kunnen doorgroeien, ook als ik tegen mijn grenzen aanloop.",

      "For years, we\u2019ve been a trusted partner in wireless audio, helping performers move freely without ever compromising sound.",

They\u2019re simple, solid, and budget-friendly \u2014 an efficient and fail-proof solution when mobility isn\u2019t the priority.",

Fortunately, the PM-25/25S helps you focus on your voice with its uniform cardioid pickup, which excels at rejecting background noise.",

      "Combining efficiency, durability, and portability to provide you with a superior coffee grinding experience \u2014 for barista-quality coffee, anywhere you go.",
      "Ever wondered why your cup of coffee at the coffeeshop tastes so much better than what you get at home? We\u2019ll spill the (coffee) beans: A fresh and even coffee grind.",
      "You know, most coffee grinders on the market, especially the cheap ones, come with \u2014 dare we say it \u2014 blade grinders. They work, but will always give you an uneven grind that just doesn\u2019t cut it.",
      "Moreover, pre-ground coffee loses aroma, as the essential fatty acids responsible for rich flavor vaporize over time. That\u2019s why, for a rich coffee flavor, freshly ground coffee is an absolute must.",
      "Even if you have the best coffee machine in the world, if your grind isn\u2019t fresh and even, you\u2019re going to end up with a cup of coffee that just doesn\u2019t come close to barista-quality.",
      "And that\u2019s exactly where Goudveer F1 shines.",
      "The secret behind a great cup of coffee lies in the grind. Goudveer F1 features a patented conical burr grinder (more on that below) in a unique motor-burr system, designed for precision and durability.",
      "Crafted from the highest quality 420 stainless steel with a Rockwell hardness of 50+ HRC, it provides unmatched tensile strength.",
      "And the result? Coffee beans that are always ground to the perfect size \u2014 for a cup of coffee that's full of flavor and depth, just the way you love it.",
      "Goudveer F1 offers both automatic and manual modes for the ultimate coffee-making flexibility. So you get to use the motor module to get your beans ground up with just a press of the button, or snap on the manual grinder add-on and enjoy that super-satisfying manual grinding action.",
      "*Please note that the hand crank comes as an add-on.",
      "You can finally take the taste of barista-brewed coffee anywhere you go. Out camping, traveling, road trips, at the office (excellent for AeroPress) \u2014 or for your daily brew in a cozy corner in your kitchen. It\u2019s battery powered, so you don\u2019t need a power outlet, its portable mini size fits snugly in your hand and your backpack, making it perfect for those on-the-go coffee cravings.",
      "Finetune and get the exact grind you need for any type of coffee \u2014 from course for french press, all the way to the finest grind for a creamy cup of espresso.",
      "With a 48mm five-star conical burr and a 100-level adjustment knob (fine-tune control) \u2014 each level adjusting 0.018 mm (18 microns) \u2014 you can get your coffee grind the way you like it, just like the pros. Anytime, every time.",
      "The Goudveer F1's versatility allows you to enjoy a wide range of coffee styles. Here's a quick guide to help you find the perfect setting for your preferred brewing method:",
      "Remember, these are starting points, and you may want to fine-tune the settings based on your specific taste preferences and the particularities of your coffee beans. The Goudveer F1's precise adjustment capability ensures you can experiment to find your perfect cup!",
      "Thanks to its patented Ultra Stable conical burr design paired with a high RPM stable brushless motor, the Goudveer F1 stands out in its class. It delivers a consistent and evenly distributed grind, crucial for achieving barista-level espresso and pour-over coffee.",
      "This meticulous engineering combats the common issue of channeling \u2014 a pitfall of uneven grind sizes found in other grinders \u2014 that can significantly affect the taste of your coffee. With the Goudveer F1, each brew is a step closer to perfection, free from the inconsistencies that mar the coffee experience.",
      "Battery-operated, this grinder allows up to 35-50 grinding cycles on a single charge. In other words \u2014 that\u2019s an amazing month-long battery life!",
      "No need to hunt for power outlets or deal with annoying power cords ruining your zen. Coffee moments should be happy moments \u2014 and with Goudveer F1, you get to enjoy the freedom of grinding without limits.",
      "Don't you hate it when you have to smack your coffee grinder out after every grind to prevent more and more residue from getting stuck behind? Left behind residue equals bitter coffee, and no one likes bitter coffee \u2014 so Goudveer F1 comes with a direct structure that ensures every bit of the coffee bean is extracted without leaving behind any residue. Now you can focus on making, not smacking, and enjoy maximum flavor.",
      "Experience fully automated grind control with just the press of a button. Set it, forget it, and return to a ready-to-go grind. Plus, you no longer need to worry about damage from a stuck piece of coffee bean. The grinder will automatically stop when a hard foreign chunk gets stuck \u2014 keeping your Goudveer F1 safe and in top condition. For a long time to go.",
      "Enjoy your morning ritual without the distracting noise, and be amazed at how silent a coffee grinder can be. At just 60 dB, the Goudveer F1 operates with such a low hum, it's barely audible. No more disturbing the tranquil morning calm or waking up your family with a loud grinding noise. Turn your morning coffee preparation into a peaceful moment that\u2019s just for you.",
      "With a premium all-aluminum construction in a stunning gold color that will elevate any space, the Goudveer F1 is one that you\u2019ll want to show off. Today, tomorrow, always. It\u2019s a sleek and stylish, timeless statement piece that belongs on your kitchen counter, or wherever you choose to make coffee magic happen.",
      "Nothing beats the superiority of burr grinders. Unlike blade grinders which indiscriminately chop coffee beans resulting in inconsistent grind sizes, burr grinders crush them to a uniform size. This results in a balanced extraction, and ultimately, a better cup of coffee.",
      "And so, at the heart of Goudveer F1 lies our patented burr drive system \u2014 a groundbreaking innovation that sets it apart in the world of coffee grinders. Its unique design ensures horizontal stability by keeping a short distance from the motor to the burr. This significantly reduces burr wobble, which can lead to an inconsistent grind.",
      "This attention to detail positions the Goudveer F1 as a coffee grinder that doesn't just match your expectations, but exceeds them.",
      "Every cup will be a promise of precision, consistency, and most importantly, unmatched flavor. It's not just about making coffee; it's about experiencing the joy of a really good cup\u2026 every, single, time.",
      "Because your coffee deserves more than just a good grind, it deserves the very best.",
      "Time is precious, especially in the mornings when you're rushing to start your day. Wouldn't it be great if your coffee grinder understood that too? Goudveer F1 ensures your coffee beans are ready for brewing in under a minute!",
      "In the time it takes to butter your toast, your coffee beans are ground to your exact preference, ready to brew. Are you ready to embrace a smoother, more efficient morning routine?",
      "Goudveer F1 is built with top-notch materials to ensure it stands the test of time and daily use.",
      "For the grinder, we went with high-quality 420 stainless steel known for its robustness and non-corrosive nature \u2014 with a Rockwell hardness of at least 50 HRC. This means it won't wear out, no matter how much coffee you grind.",
      "As for the body, you get a premium-looking all-aluminum design. Not only does this provide a sleek, modern aesthetic that will complement any environment, it is also incredibly durable, lightweight and easy to handle.",
      "Other grinders might lose their edge with use. But your Goudveer F1 will keep on going. It\u2019s a lifelong companion for your coffee journey.",
      "Not that you\u2019re going to need it very often (month-long battery life, remember?) \u2014 but Goudveer F1 comes equipped with a Type-C fast charging port. So you can charge it up fully in just 30 minutes with any Type-C charger \u2014 even with your power bank. So, whether you're at home, at the office, traveling to your next holiday destination, or camping in the great outdoors, your perfect brew is never more than a quick charge away.",
      "Washing by hand? Don\u2019t bother. Goudveer F1 is dishwasher-safe, and thanks to its detachable design, getting it ready for a wash is as easy as it gets! All you need to do is detach the motor compartment, and toss the rest into the dishwasher. Seriously. It's that easy.",
      "Grinding with Goudveer F1 is as easy as it gets.",
      "The vision for Goudveer emerged in the heart of the Netherlands \u2014 where the rich aroma of coffee beans blends with centuries-old traditions. Surrounded by Amsterdam\u2019s historic streets and overlooking its tranquil canals, our founders were inspired by the weightlessness of a feather and the unmatched luxury of gold. Thus, naming our brand \u201cGoudveer\u201d \u2014 Dutch for Gold Feather.",
      "A symbol of luxuriousness, yet light in form, Goudveer embodies the meticulous Dutch craftsmanship, refined over generations, and the fervent spirit of innovation from the United States. As dusk painted the Dutch skies one evening, our artisans, sipping on a brew that echoed the Netherlands\u2019 profound coffee culture, envisioned a creation that would seamlessly bridge the Atlantic, drawing on the cultural magnificence of both lands.",
      "And so, the Goudveer F1 was born \u2014 a masterpiece that blends Dutch legacy with American ingenuity. Every Goudveer F1 carries with it tales of two nations, harmoniously coming together into a singular, luxurious experience.",
      "As we take you on this transcendent journey through the rich tapestries of our heritage, we invite you to feel the weight of history and the lightness of innovation with every sip you take.",

      "Applying Wonder-C Tex (*antibacterial fabric) that kills harmful substances such as athlete's foot bacteria and fungus and suppresses foot odor, Inevitable Insole proves its efficiency just with insole replacement. Wonder Feet Inevitable Insole is here to help you if you\u2019re suffering from athlete\u2019s foot and foot odor.",
      "It is known that 15% of the world's population has athlete's foot. 1 out of every 6 people has athlete's foot bacteria, and millions of people visit hospitals every year to receive treatment.",
      "Athlete's foot occurs with an infection by a fungus called 'Trichophyton Rubrum', and once it occurs, it becomes contagious, moving from skin to skin as a parasite. Athlete\u2019s foot bacteria can be infected to the face and ears, as well as toes, fingers and feet. Due to this contagiousness, the bacteria continuously re-occurs and it should be completely eradicated.",
      "1.  Foot (athlete\u2019s foot infiltrates feet)",
      "2.  Athlete\u2019s foot bacteria breeds inside the shoes",

      "Wonder-C Tex is a new anti-bacterial material made by whipping 99.9 % of pure copper into slices thinner than human hair.",
      "It is called \"Antibacterial copper\" due to the natural occurrence of antibacterial activity in copper.   By acting on bacteria and viruses such as E-coli and food poisoning bacteria, antimicrobial copper is highly effective in preventing infectious diseases and cross infection.  It is the strongest and non-toxic human-friendly antibacterial material, being a natural material.",
      "There is little variation in the antimaterial activity regardless of the particle size. Also, it has much better antibacterial power than silver (nano) and ceramic materials because it does not create resistant bacteria even after time.",
      "Antimicrobial effect stays unaffected by the external environment including heat and humidity. Antibacterial copper is a semi-permanent material that maintains its antibacterial powers even after discoloration or abrasion.",
      "Antibacterial copper is a natural antibacterial material that is harmless to the human body and the environment. It is 100% recyclable because no added chemicals are required, thanks to the natural antibacterial effects of copper itself. Even in recycled copper, the effect remains unchanged.",
      "In 2011, Dr. William Keevil of the University of Southampton, England, conducted an experiment to compare the antibacterial powers between 10 million super bacteria on stainless steel and on copper. While the super bacteria on stainless steel remained alive, those on copper were almost entirely killed in 9 minutes.",

      "On top of wearing Wonder Feet, apply other athlete\u2019s foot medication on the market to maximize treatment effect. (Including toe-type athlete\u2019s foot)",
      "This is because Wonder Feet can both care for the foot and shoe environments where athlete\u2019s foot bacteria breed.",
      "Also, we recommend using Wonder Feet Insoles in matching numbers as your daily shoes to enhance effectiveness. This is to prevent the possibility of cross-contamination that could happen when you switch to normal soles from Wonder Feet soles.",
      "Hello friend.",
      "I'm Yuni,   the founder of Wonder Feet.   I would like to briefly introduce how the WONDER FEET came into the world.",
      "Originally, I had a job of making and distributing shoes in S. Korea. However, the shoes I usually sell have the cheapest insole to minimize cost, and I was always unsatisfied with the lack of cushioning because my feet were not comfortable.",
      "I had a chance to talk with the boss of a partner company, when I found out that using good materials makes more comfortable insoles. So, I developed an insole using a thick latex (6mm) without worrying about the cost and applied it to shoes and heels, which was met with positive response by the customers.",
      "Since then, I became more interested in people's feet and started to study the various types of functional insoles. But the question was why premium functional insoles were limited to foot arches, cushioning and structural problems.",
      "Actually, I thought the real issue with people's feet was athlete's foot and foot odor. Of course, not everyone has these problems, but I knew for a fact that quite a lot of people are suffering from this problem.",
      "I thought I had a solution to solve this problem by connecting it with the insole. Because feet are always in shoes and shoes are always laid with insoles.",
      "After desperately searching for a way, I finally found my answer.",
      "I thought it would be really cool if people could just say goodbye to the repulsive itch and shameful foot odor by simply replacing their insoles.",
      "So, I named my invention, Wonder Feet. Of course, arch supports and shock absorbing cushioning are basic functions.",
      "If you are suffering from athlete's foot, itching, foot odor for a long period of time, or are afraid to know how to prevent them, I recommend trying out Wonder Feet. I\u2019m more than confident they will help!",
      "Your friend,",
      "Yuni",
      "Q.  Is Wonder Feet only applicable to athlete\u2019s foot patients and those with foot odor?",
      "A.  No. Athlete\u2019s foot and foot odor are very common problems exposed to everyone, because they result from fungus bacteria that are easily infected even with the smallest contact with people around you.",
      "Q.  Is Wonder Feet effective on toenail athlete\u2019s foot, as well?",
      "A.   Toenail-type athlete\u2019s foot lasts longer and is more difficult to eradicate than athlete\u2019s foot. Wonder Fit effectively creates an environment in which athlete\u2019s foot bacteria cannot thrive, even for toe-type disease.",
      "Q. What if the odor remains even after I wear Wonder Feet insole?",
      "A.  Wonder Feet is not a deodorant, the odor eliminating effect doesn\u2019t come magically as soon as you put it on. The antibacterial copper fabric needs time to reduce the bacteria and odor. Foot odor will be eliminated in as early as 3 day, and usually within 7 days. But in case of severe symptoms, it could take up to a maximum of 15 days.",
      "Q. Does Wonder Feet help with plantar fasciitis?",
      "A. Of course. Wonder Feet has adopted a proper cushion and arch support structure to help people suffering foot pain.",
      "Q. Does it help with ankle or back pain?",
      "A. Wonder Feet's arch supports and heel features help your feet to better support your body's load.  If the arch of a foot collapses, it causes the body to lose balance. Wonder Feet insole will help both feet work well together to balance.",
      "Q. How thick is the insole?",
      "A.   Wonder feet has a thickness of 4mm for proper cushioning. Usually, insoles are about 2~3mm thick. So, it is recommended to use Wonder Feet in shoes that are slightly looser than others.",
      "Q. Do the insoles come in children\u2019s sizes, too?",
      "A.   Unfortunately, we could not prepare the children's size for this moment. But we\u2019ll consider them if there are requests by the consumers.",

      "Our story with Linky began 8 years ago when we started producing and selling the first version of the foldable electric longboard. Kickstarter was the platform that we used to present our product to the world. Even if we managed to reach more than 80.000$, unfortunately, our first campaign was not successful mostly due to inexperience in marketing and specifically in crowdfunding. We didn't give up, we kept going and with the lesson learned we improved our marketing and managed to find the funding to start the production of Linky. The success of the Linky 1.0 has demonstrated to us that its main feature, the folding system was efficient, resistant, and highly appreciated by our users. The evolution into Linky 2.0 started from there. Our research and development team has been working for about 4 years around the widely tested and approved \"folding system\" to improve the quality of the experience of our customers by providing a real vehicle that could be used as an alternative to cars in the city environment. We started by gathering feedback from the many users of the Linky 1.0 and we came out with a layout of the new product that, from the outside can look quite similar to the first one but, from a technological and UX standpoint represents a complete revolution. The major difficulty has been to improve the product in many aspects while maintaining the portability (weight and dimensions) at the top. The main points of difference and innovation where we focused our studies and investments are the following:",

The feedback we received was off the charts! We were convinced we created the perfect trunks. But hen we had a few backers who asked us if we could also add a pocket to protect their valuables. That's when we realized we were indeed missing an important feature. We right away jumped back to the drawing board and brought HARMONQLO 2.0 to life. Hopefully now our shorts will be the perfect solution we've all been waiting for.",
      "If you follow the size chart carefully, then the shorts will fit you just fine. Still, if you wish to exchange your shorts for any reason, we will allow you to do that as long as they have not been used and still have the original tags attached. However, you will just need to cover the 2 way shipping. As we are offering our trunks at an extremely high discounted price exclusively on Kickstarter we won't be able to accept any returns.",
