      "Experience the densities of 11 elemental metals with these precision machined cubes.",
      "Density Cubes was first launched on Kickstarter in 2020. The idea was to create a fascinating, interactive representation of the densities of metal elements. We introduced 5 different pure metal elements, each precisely cut to different sizes so every cube weighs exactly the same.",
      "The Complete Density Cube Collection + Silver Add-On",
      "We are now back with Density Cubes 2.0, a new set of metals that allow you to begin or extend your collection, plus a stunning silver add-on cube. The original Density Cubes 1.0set is also available, so you can either choose your favourite set or purchase the complete collection.",
      "Choose from the following set options:",
      "1 x tungsten cube",

      "1 x iron cube",

      "Density Cubes 1.0 and 2.0 on the standard double layer sleek acrylic display base",

      "The silver cube is the second densest cube after tungsten, with a density of 10.49 g/cm\u00b3 and a volume of 1.84cm\u00b3. Silver is a precious, lustrous transition metal, with a brilliant white colour that makes it stands out. We have chosen to make the silver cube an optional add-on rather than including it within one of the Density Cubes sets in order to ensure both of the standard sets remain affordable. Made from 99.9% pure silver, the silver cube will certainly be the crowning jewel of your Density Cubes collection. To add a solid silver cube to your set(s), select from the add-on options during checkout.",
      "Silver Add-On Density Cube",
      "The original Density Cubes were chosen due to the striking variety between cubes, in terms of density, colour and properties. The newest cubes, zirconium, zinc, tin, nickel and bismuth, are intriguing and varied elements which can either combine with the original Density Cubes set, or exist as a stand-alone set. For instance, zinc is used to coat other metals as an anti-corrosion agent, while bismuth forms rainbow-coloured crystals on its surface upon oxidisation. The solid silver add-on cube was chosen due to its reputation as an extremely precious metal, and the fact that it\u2019s the whitest and most reflective of the precious metals.",

      "Have a look at some of the feedback the original Density Cubes set received:",
      "An array of elements from the Density Cubes 2.0 set",
      "KEEPING YOUR COLLECTION SPARKLING",
      "Copper and Iron are naturally prone to slight oxidisation which can make their original colour change to form a patina, while zinc can lose its shine over a long period of time. Here are the best ways to maintain the original condition of your Density Cubes:",
      "Iron: simply keep it as dry as possible.",
      "Copper: clean it by mixing lemon juice or vinegar with a little salt and rubbing it over the surfaces.",
      "Zinc: occasionally lightly oil or wax the surfaces to avoid it's shine eventully becoming dull.",
      "QUALITY CONTROL",
      "Each cube has been precision-cut from the highest purity metals available and laser engraved with its unique periodic symbol, atomic number and name. Every cube is then hand weighed to ensure it fits within a tight tolerance of less than 1% variation* between cubes!",
      "*Variation is due to letter etching and the sanding of corners/edges to make the cubes safe to touch.",
      "Risks and challenges",
      "I do not see any unconquerable challenges arising with the delivery of my project. Density Cubes has been fully prototyped, and I have the capacity to produce the sets in copious volumes if required. But of course with any new project like this, there is a small chance of unanticipated delay, perhaps due to a late shipment arrival or items failing my quality testing and needing to therefore be replaced. In order to hedge and overcome these risks I have accounted for the addition of multiple weeks into the delivery date. I am 100% ready to bring Density Cubes to market, so you too can have a piece of science on your desk. My ultimate goal is to respond promptly to communications and to deliver a great product exactly as you would expect from your pledge.",

      "The Bass Tooth Brushing (Scientific Vertical Brushing) is a method of brushing that effectively removes food debris and plaque from the gingival margins, gingival sulcus, and surface of the teeth, and is recommended by several national dental associations. By removing plaque and massaging the gums it helps to minimize disease-causing factors in the oral cavity, increase resistance to disease, prevent calculus, and prevent recession of the gums.",
      "Titanium is recognized as a non-toxic element in the world, and has become the \"King of Honorary Metals\" due to its resistance to high and low temperatures, strong acids and alkalis, high strength, and anti-bacterial and biophilic properties.\nTitanium itself does not emit harmful metal elements, so it is suitable for long-term use.",
      "Innovative L-shaped rotating vertical brush design: Unleash the potential of your daily oral hygiene routine with our Clean One 2.0 breakthrough.",
      "As we all know, horizontal brushing will grind the teeth into wedge-shaped defects, and it is not easy to remove the food debris in the crevices, which will easily cause chronic inflammation of the gums over time, resulting in bleeding and shrinkage of the gums, and even the pressure from the roots of the teeth will cause great damage to the gingival tissues.",
      "Say goodbye to the ordinary and embrace the extraordinary! With its revolutionary L-shaped design, Clean One 2.0 is not just a toothbrush, it's a game changer. The entire body is made of titanium, keeping it lightweight and resistant to surface flaking and oxidization. The new titanium material design is more eco-friendly and durable.",

Clean your teeth, look great, and the Clean One 2.0 will come with a lifetime warranty.",
      "Toothbrushes are products we use every day and inevitably over 20 billion of them are thrown away every year! Most of them are made from cheap, disposable materials that have a short lifespan and are difficult to recycle! This is unacceptable.",
      "Clean One 2.0 comes with a replaceable brush head and ultra-soft 0.15mm food-grade silicone bristles, pampering your gums and dental health with the softest yet most effective bristles while being anti-bacterial. Use silicone toothbrush head gums do not bleed, because the silicone toothbrush fiber is thicker, instead of piercing into the flesh of the gums and teeth, which does not easily lead to capillary dilation, gum sensitivity bleeding. In addition the cleaning power is superb! This is because the silicone adsorption is very strong, like using chewing gum, to adsorb tooth stains.",
      "What does this mean for you? You can get a bright smile without creating plastic waste. Every brush helps create a cleaner environment.",
      "Removal: Remove the brush head by rotating the brush handle to the center and pulling the handle \u2461 out of the brush head \u2463.",
      "Installation: Insert the handle \u2462 diagonally into the brush head hole \u2460, then press the handle \u2463 into the brush head hole \u2461.",
      "Leaving your toothbrush lying around exposes it to all sorts of harmful bacteria, so we've also equipped it with a special toothbrush base that allows the Clean One 2.0 to stand securely without touching anything else, thus allowing the toothbrush to dry naturally. Together they protect your health.",

Your support is more than just a better smile; it's a commitment to a greener, healthier future. It's time to embrace a new era of innovation, sustainability and oral hygiene!",

After the cotton is harvested, it is then spun into yarn and often dyed with harmful chemicals, which can spillover into waterways and the land.

      "For those of you saying, what about bamboo?  The truth is that bamboo's is rayon. If you were to test your bamboo towels, there would be little to no bamboo present in the towel.  This is due to a textile process that takes the bamboo and melts it down to a smooth gel-like liquid state (very much like super glue) using chemicals such as Sodium Hydroxide & Carbon Di-sulfate which are both considered harmful to the environment by some researchers.  From here, the liquid is channeled through incredibly fine holes straight into a bath of water that instantly cools it solid. This incredibly thin fiber is then rolled into spools to be later twisted with additional fibers to produce thread & yarns which can then be used in the making of the fabric we make our clothes out of and unfortunately, has no bamboo left in the product, which is one more reason why we are advocating for transparency around the process and using hemp as a preferred fiber.",

Another historical milestone, the design of the Lunar Lander, which was used by NASA for the Apollo moon landing mission, is another source of inspiration for me. The Lunar Lander was designed to be lightweight, compact, and highly functional, with the ability to fold up and fit into a small space. This design feature has inspired me to think about how I can create products that are not only functional but also highly portable, space-saving and aesthetic of minimalism.",

      "THIS CAMPAIGN IS CLOSED",
      "Liberux NEXX",
      "THE LINUX PHONE YOU\u2019VE BEEN WAITING FOR.",
      "THE LINUX PHONE YOU\u2019VE BEEN WAITING FOR.",
      "The phone for free people.\nMost smartphones today are built around a model that prioritizes the manufacturer\u2019s control over the user\u2019s freedom. There\u2019s a deep lack of transparency, growing conflicts of interest, and constant surveillance disguised as convenience. We set out to build something different. Liberux NEXX is our answer: a phone that doesn\u2019t spy on you, doesn\u2019t hide its code, and doesn\u2019t rely on opaque commercial agendas. It\u2019s a solution that\u2019s free, ethical, and open. We chose Open Source as our foundation and privacy as a principle \u2014 not a product. This is a device for those who refuse to trade their digital sovereignty for comfort.",
      "The Liberux NEXX is a high-performance Linux smartphone designed from the ground up for privacy, openness, and power. It packs an octa-core Rockchip RK3588S CPU (4\u00d7Cortex-A76 + 4\u00d7Cortex-A55 up to 2.4\u202fGHz) with 32\u202fGB LPDDR4x RAM and a 6.34\u2033 2400\u00d71080 OLED display. Storage is plentiful \u2013 512\u202fGB of replaceable and expandable eMMC plus expandable microSD (up to 2\u202fTB) \u2013 and connectivity includes dual USB-C ports, 5G, Wi-Fi 5, Bluetooth 5.0, and even a headphone jack.",
      "The NEXX runs LiberuxOS, a Debian 13-based Linux distribution that is ethical and open-source. The system uses a Liberux customiced Gnome Shell Mobile, providing a polished, multitasking-friendly interface adapted to smartphones and tablets. It's designed with convergence in mind: when connected to a larger screen and keyboard, the interface shifts into a desktop-style environment. You can use NEXX as your daily smartphone \u2013 and then turn it into a full workstation in seconds.",
      "The software is also compatible with Android applications, thanks to container-based isolation (like WayDroid), which allows you to use popular apps without compromising system integrity or user privacy.",
      "Hardware kill-switches let you physically cut power to the modem, Wi-Fi/Bluetooth module, and camera/microphone system whenever you choose, ensuring your data stays private. When all three switches are flipped down, they also disable additional components like the GNSS unit (GPS and related satellite systems), the IMU (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer), and ambient and proximity sensors. In short, NEXX combines laptop-class specs with user-owned software \u2013 making it one of the most powerful, open, and secure Linux phones to date.",
      "Building on years of Linux expertise (our team\u2019s past projects and passion for freedom), Liberux NEXX was inspired by the desire to give people \u201cfreedom to own your hardware, your software, and your own life\u201d. We envision a phone you can upgrade and customize for years, not a disposable gadget. Every aspect \u2013 from the removable memory and 5300\u202fmAh battery to planned 5-year software support \u2013 is aimed at resisting planned obsolescence and mass data collection. Our roadmap even includes accessories (like a wireless RDP dock or a keyboard) to turn your phone into a full PC when needed. In short, NEXX stands for privacy, security, and freedom \u2013 a true pocket computer that respects you.",
      "High-End Performance: 8\u2011core (up to 2.4\u202fGHz) CPU, 32\u202fGB LPDDR4x RAM, and 512\u202fGB storage (plus optional 2\u202fTB microSD) \u2013 enough power to run desktop-class Linux apps on the go.",
      "Open-Source OS: LiberuxOS (Debian 13-based) puts you in control of software. Install and update safely (Debian is known for stability), with most source code available and 5+ years of planned updates.",
      "Privacy by Design: No built-in tracking \u2013 \u201cwe will not collect or monitor any of your data\u201d. Includes 3 physical kill-switches.",
      "Extensive Connectivity: Dual USB-C 3.1 ports, 3.5\u202fmm audio jack, and modern radios (5G, Wi-Fi 5, Bluetooth 5.0) for everything you need.",
      "Desktop-Capable: Use NEXX as a mini-PC. With our planned wireless monitor/keyboard adapter (RDP support), you can connect to a monitor and peripherals to get a full desktop experience.",
      "Long Battery & Expandability: Large 5300\u202fmAh removable battery, plus a second USB-C port so you can charge while using accessories. The sturdy design and replaceable components maximize lifespan and reduce e-waste.",
      "At Liberux, our commitment is simple: every euro raised through this crowdfunding campaign will be fully invested into making this device better \u2014 in both hardware and software. Our goal is to create a free, ethical, repairable, and user-respecting ecosystem.",
      "We\u2019re not here to maximize profit. We\u2019re here to offer a real alternative in a market dominated by closed, disposable, and controlling devices. That\u2019s why every development choice, every supplier, and every component is chosen with care \u2014 favoring local, ethical manufacturing and a transparent production process.",
      "The Liberux Nexx is designed for continuous improvement. Key components like the battery and eMMC storage are easily accessible and replaceable. We want users to repair, upgrade, and extend the lifespan of their device \u2014 without depending on us or any corporation.",
      "Backing us means more than just getting a product. It means helping shape a different kind of tech future.",
      "During the years of development of Liberux NEXX, we've been fortunate to experiment with many of the devices that paved the way for open mobile technology. From the legendary Nokia N900 to gems like Purism\u2019s Librem 5 or Pine64\u2019s PinePhone Pro, we\u2019ve bought, analyzed, and learned from each one of them. Personally, we want to thank all the teams behind these projects. The work they do is remarkable\u2014not just for its technical achievements, but for their ethical commitment to user freedom. Our heartfelt thanks go to Purism, Pine64, PostmarketOS, Mobian, and the entire community that continues to push the boundaries of what\u2019s possible in free software and open hardware. Without them, none of this would exist. We hope to add our own contribution and help build the future we all want to see: one where technology respects our freedom.",
      "As for the current landscape, the Linux smartphone market is still limited, and most available devices feature modest or older-generation hardware. For example, the original PinePhone and PinePhone Pro use low-performance Rockchip SoCs and offer only 3\u20134\u202fGB of RAM, while the Librem 5 runs on a 28\u202fnm i.MX8M with 3\u202fGB of RAM. These phones are excellent for enthusiasts and developers, but they don\u2019t compete in performance with conventional smartphones.",
      "In this context, Liberux NEXX breaks those limits: with 32\u202fGB of RAM, 5G support, and a cutting-edge RK3588S processor, it stands as one of the most powerful Linux smartphones ever created. It also offers up to 2.5\u202fTB of removable storage, a user-replaceable battery, and physical killswitches to maximize privacy. It\u2019s a device designed not just for technical users, but for anyone who wants a complete, modern, and ethical mobile experience. In short, NEXX is an evolutionary leap within the Linux smartphone ecosystem.",
      "We already have a working prototype of the Liberux NEXX and are actively testing its hardware and software stack. Our first mainboard has been fully assembled and debugged: after resolving a few minor hardware issues (such as solder-mask adjustments and component alignment), the RK3588S processor is now detected and communicating correctly with a host PC.",
      "In parallel, we\u2019re collaborating with a local manufacturing partner to improve PCB yield. Our software team is porting Debian 13 to the device, adapting GNOME Shell Mobile for daily use, and integrating Android app compatibility via a sandboxed container. These steps bring us close to a fully functional, user-ready platform.",
      "This campaign will allow us to transition from a tested engineering prototype to a certified and manufactured device, ready to ship to our backers.",
      "The Liberux NEXX has been designed with a modular architecture for key components: storage, memory, and mobile modem. This enables not only repairability and upgrades, but also the reuse of parts in future motherboard revisions.",
      "Storage (eMMC):\n  We use interchangeable modules compatible with the same standard sockets used by Orange Pi and Radxa.",
      "Currently available:",
      "128\u202fGB (included)",

      "We believe in full transparency about risks, and we have plans to address each. Key challenges include:",
      "Hardware & Manufacturing: As with any new gadget, early prototypes may reveal design issues. Our first dev-board did have a few minor faults (mis-oriented parts, a charging circuit tweak, etc.) which we identified and fixed immediately. Going forward, we have a trusted local manufacturer helping to refine the PCB and assembly process, greatly reducing the chance of future errors.",
      "Software Development: Porting and optimizing a full Linux system to new hardware is complex. We are basing LiberuxOS on Debian 13 (a proven, stable Linux distribution) and we have already booted the OS on our dev board. We will use iterative testing and open-source tools to debug drivers. By working in public and inviting community testing early, we can catch and fix issues faster.",
      "Supply Chain & Timing: Global parts shortages and shipping delays are industry-wide concerns. To mitigate this problem, we will enter into agreements with several suppliers of critical components (CPUs, displays, etc.).",
      "Certification & Regulations: Securing CE and FCC certifications can be time-consuming and costly. We have factored in these costs and lead times into our plan.",
      "Logistics: Shipping electronics worldwide can face customs and carrier issues. We will work with fulfillment partners who specialize in international shipments and keep transparent shipping timelines.",
      "Every risk above is met with experience and preparation. We will keep backers updated on milestones and any hurdles \u2013 and we\u2019re committed to resolving issues as they arise.",
      "Your support doesn\u2019t have to be financial. Here are some ways to help without pledging:",
      "Spread the Word: Share our campaign and story on social media, tech forums, blogs, and with friends or colleagues who care about privacy and open tech. Word-of-mouth is vital.",
      "Join the Conversation: Follow us on Mastodon to give feedback, ask questions, or translate our materials into other languages. A tip, review, or blog post can make a big difference.",
      "Engage with Media: If you have connections to tech journalists, invite them to write about us. Coverage in tech news sites raises awareness and credibility.",

      "Risks and challenges",
      "1. Potential delays with manufacturer: Depending on the overall demand for this product, if the demand exceeds the total supply that our manufacturers and suppliers can offer, this could cause potential delays in the shipping of components required to assemble these tickers. In this scenario, we will be sure to work vigorously with our manufacturers to increase volume of production and ensure that supply chain is fully operational to meet the demand. Should this problem arise, we will also be transparent and let all our backers know about such problem and keep them fully updated on the situation.",
      "2. Failure to meet expected delivery date: Again, relating to the possibility of demand exceeding supply, given that we are a relatively small team, and the tickers are all hand assembled, we may not have enough labour force to meet the demand. Should we start falling behind schedule, the plan would be to hire even more staff to help assemble, package and ship the tickers as quickly as possible. We could also outsource assembly work to factories in China to speed things up.",
      "3. By backing this project, you agree to our terms of service, return policy and privacy policy listed on our website: https://fintic.io/",
      "Long-lasting design",

    "company_name": "Botanium",
    "allParagraphs": [
      "Featuring a long-lasting water tank, large growing space, grow light and app connectivity.",
      "Botanium Vega is a compact, easy and effortless way of growing. Its a hydroponic pot, which means it grows plants like chilies, herbs and tomatoes without soil. It waters the plants automatically.  Leave it for a month and get back to a healthy plant.",
      "Botanium was first revealed on Kickstarter early 2017. In only 5 days we were fully funded with 1420 backers from all over the world. In the end of same year we shipped around 2500 units to 65 different countries. We are now ready to launch our second product - Botanium Vega.",
      "Botanium Vega is minimalistically designed self-watering planter that enables you to grow herbs and veggies using soil-less growing technology.",
      "Plant a seed, plug it in and you can leave it alone for weeks as it takes care of the plant for you. You get more productive plants and there is no need to worry about over or under watering, the most common ways to kill plants.",
      "There is a rising demand for ways to grow your own food. In a modern busy life, tending to a plant\u2019s needs might be your last priority. And even if you do have time, you might not know how to keep it alive. Enjoy growing herbs or chili without effort. Botanium Vega takes care of the plant for you, thanks to automated, soil-free growing. Botanium Vega comes with a wider design than its predecessor with room for up to four plants.",
      "Vega features a water tank with room for 5 liter (1.3 gallon) of water. Compared with our first Botanium, this is 5x the volume and 25% more water per plant. (if you grow four plants in it). Thanks to this, the water lasts for many weeks.",
      "Vega automatically waters your plants multiple times per day. We have also made it possible to change this schedule so that you can make it water every hour or just once every day.",
      "Botanium Vega uses soil-less - so called hydroponic - gardening technology to grow plants from seed. This has many advantages - the plants can grow larger using less roots, and they will also regrow quicker after harvest.",
      "This also enables the Vega to automatically water the plants without needing to measure the moisture in the soil.",
      "By popular request, our new Botanium Vega is connected to your smartphone using the Botanium app. Use it to get notifications when you need to refill it, and to monitor your Botanium when you are away from home.",
      "We also include a powerful 20 watt LED growing light that enables you to grow anywhere - even during the dark winter. It can be adjusted in height and controlled through the Botanium app.",
      "Hydroponics is simply growing without soil. The roots need water, nutrients and oxygen, all of which can be provided in a more efficient way than in soil. Botanium's porous growing medium absorbs a lot of water, while also providing an aerated environment for the roots.",
      "The benefits of this are not only quicker growth and more control, but also a simpler approach to growing.",
      "The great thing about hydroponics is that you can never overwater the plants you grow. Therefore, you don't need to take into account things like letting the soil dry out before watering again (and not waiting too long so your plants wilt).\n\n  All you need to do is to fill the reservoir when you see the water level getting low. The water lasts several week (depending on the plant, light and heat)",
      ">",
      "At Botanium, we believe that gardening should be simple and available to everyone, even to those living in a city or without much time to take care of a plant. We want to change how greens and herbs are produced indoors, making it possible to bring out the gardener in everyone.",
      "Grow basil",
      "Basil grows quite fast and is a good alternative for the impatient grower. As it needs a lot of water, it thrives in the Botanium where it gets watered often and evenly.",
      "Grow tomatoes",
      "Like its' relatives chili peppers, potatoes and tobacco, tomatoes originate from South America. It is a fast growing plant that thrives in hydroponic systems like Botanium.",
      "Grow chili",
      "What makes chili growing so rewarding is that even a small amount of chili lasts a long time \u2013 in contrast to strawberries for instance, which you easily can eat faster than it grows.",
      "You can also grow rocket salad, thyme, oregano, strawberries, mint and much much more.",
      "Botanium Vega features a 20 watt growing light that is adjustable in height. So as your plants grow you can unscrew the knob and adjust the light accordingly.",
      "The lamp is equipped with state-of-the-art LEDs that are attached to a lamp screen made of extruded aluminum. This screen does not only eliminates glare, but also works as a powerful heatsink that makes it possible to run the LEDs cool - making them run efficently at 175 lumen per watt.",
      "The lamp can be removed if you have a sunny window and you don't need the extra light.",
      "When talking with Botanium users, it was clear that a highly requested feature was app connectivity. And we listened! From the very start, it was important for us to make an app only if it made sense, and if it could be useful. We didn't want to create an app that is just another gimmick. The Botanium Vega has optimized default settings in place that doesn't require you to use the app - but it does add extra controls and features.",
      "The Botanium app is connected to Vega with wi-fi, so you can keep track of your grow wherever you are.",
      "Water level",
      "Keep track of the current water level and get notified when the water level runs low. If you plan to be away from home a few weeks, you can easily check if you need to refill before leaving.",
      "Nutrients",
      "Different kind of plants have different nutrient demands. The Botanium app calculates the right amount of nutrient based on the plants you grow. Specify what you grow, and it will tell you how much nutrients you need to add each time you refill the water.",
      "Lamp",
      "Turn the lamp on and off from your couch. You can also schedule when the lamp turns on or off, so that you don't need to be disturbed by it early in on a sunday morning.",
      "Botanium is designed in Sweden, a country that embodies the Scandinavian design movement. This style \u2013 often referred to as minimalist \u2013 developed during the Second World War, with clean, simple lines and a strong emphasis on functionality. A common theme in this tradition is that beautiful and functional objects should be available to all.",
      "Botanium Vega consists of a 5 liter water tank and a growing container. A water pump moves water up to top, and distributes it evenly over the growing medium. It trickles down and returns back to the water tank, so it later can be reused.",
      "Dimensions: 530 mm (20,9\") x 145 mm (5,7\") x 200 mm (7.9\") (without lamp)\nColor: White (if the stretch goal is achieved, two additional colors will be unlocked.)\nPlug: Vega will be shipped with plugs for Europe, US, UK and Australia/New Zealand.\nPower: 12V\nLamp: 20 w LED light, 200 ppfd @ 100 mm\nConnectivity: Wi-fi\nUsage: Indoor use only",
      "We have been testing several functioning prototypes over the last year to make sure that it works as intended. Since Vega is the evolution of our first product, we have applied what we have learned from that and improved it.",
      "It is important to us that it does not only work as intended and looks good, but also that the design is user-friendly and intuitive.",
      "Botanium was founded in Stockholm in 2016 by a group of designers and engineers with a passion for creating innovative products that enable everyone to grow their own food without compromising their modern lifestyle. We strive to accelerate and simplify urban gardening, enabling everyone to be a grower.",
      "We are glad to have such a competent team that can make Botanium Vega a reality!",
      "Wanna grow in a Botanium now and can't wait until 2021? During the campaign for Botanium Vega, we will offer you 15% discount on our first Botanium that was first revealed in 2017 on Kickstarter and Indiegogo.

      "Quick Deployment: One of the main advantages of the spring-loaded Speedy is the rapid deployment mechanism. With the press off the lever, the blade can be deployed swiftly and efficiently, making them ideal for situations where speed is essential, such as self-defense or emergency situations.",
      "One-Handed Operation: Speedy can be operated with one hand, allowing for easy deployment even when the other hand is occupied. This can be particularly useful in situations where you need to keep one hand free for other tasks.",
      "440 Carbon stainless steel is extremely high-grade. It offers a good balance of corrosion resistance, durability, ease of sharpening, and overall ease of use. It's easier to maintain and less prone to staining or rusting, especially in humid or wet environments.",
      "Speedy is a highly versatile tool with a wide range of potential uses. Its versatility comes from its compact size, portability, and the various features it may include. Here are some common uses and situations where a pocket knife can be handy:",
      "Everyday Tasks: Opening packages, cutting twine or rope, slicing fruit, or even cutting through tape or cardboard boxes.",
      "DIY and Home Improvement: When working around the house or tackling DIY projects, a pocket knife can be useful for tasks like trimming materials, scoring surfaces, or even as a makeshift screwdriver in a pinch.",
      "Outdoor Activities: A pocket knife is indispensable for camping, hiking, fishing, and other outdoor activities. It can be used for cutting small branches, preparing food, opening cans, or even for self-defense in emergencies.",
      "Discrete conceal-ability, yet heavy-duty is the definition of the Speedy. The ultralight weight of the Speedy weighs less than 2oz. The miniature size of the pocket knife means it can easily be hidden in any coin pocket or clipped onto keychains without notice. Clip it to your keys, backpack, or even purse. The best knife is the one you are carrying.",
      "The Speedy body/handle derives from G10, also known as Garolite.  It is woven fiberglass and sealed with epoxy resin making it very strong, durable, lightweight, and resistant to water, moisture, and temperature changes.  It offers a easy grip in any situation.",
      "Speedy hosts a straight blade or \"precision cut blade\" and is fully flat ground. A flat ground blade makes it extremely versatile for most people's daily use of an every day carry.",
      "Reducing Friction: The indentations help reduce surface area and create air pockets between the blade and the material being cut. This reduces friction, allowing for smoother and easier slicing.",
      "Preventing Food from Sticking: The air pockets created by the indentations also help prevent food from sticking to the blade. This is particularly useful when slicing or chopping moist or sticky foods like cheese, fruits, or vegetables.",
      "Overall, the perforated holes on a knife blade contribute to improved performance, efficiency, and user comfort during food preparation... it also looks way cooler.",
      "For a limited time you can get the entire Bomber Collection consisting of 6 knives. Each pocket knife was individually released on Kickstarter over the past decade.",

      "With powerful magnetic retention, you\u2019ll never have to worry about losing your bits again. The storage compartment is sealed with a rugged cover, shielding your bits from dirt and debris, while providing a satisfying tactile experience every time you reach for your tool.",
      "No odd, half-sized, or proprietary bits here. We understand that everyone has different needs when it comes to daily tasks. So, being able to store and use 7 standard 1/4\" hex bits that you already own allows you to quickly customize the bit bar to your needs.",
      "Why limit yourself to one function? The UltraFix is designed to tackle a variety of tasks, allowing you to drive screws in any direction\u2014be it vertically, horizontally, or at challenging angles. You\u2019ll appreciate the freedom and speed it brings to your work, minimizing the need to switch between tools, thus allowing you to work more efficiently.",

This design doesn\u2019t hold the bit securely\u2014you often have to manually press the bit in place, which is both awkward and inefficient.",
      "To improve on this, some ratchets are designed to be detachable and magnetically reversed. While this solves the bit-holding problem, it introduces new issues:",

      "A window breaker isn\u2019t something you use every day, but when you need it, it\u2019s absolutely essential.

      "We\u2019re building Trovador, the world\u2019s first autonomous robot that can plant tree seedlings quickly and effectively on any terrain \u2013 and it\u2019s already been recognized globally (see below).",
      "But we need your support to bring it to life and start restoring forests before the next fire season hits!",
      "Growing up, we spent a lot of time around Portugal\u2019s forests and mountains. But every summer, we watched more of these landscapes go from green to grey\u2026 and stay that way for years.",
      "These are forests that should still be standing, and now urgently need to be brought back.\nBut right now, we don\u2019t have the tools to bring them back fast enough.",
      "The result? Biodiversity disappears, erosion gets worse, fire risk increases\u2026 and we lose our planet\u2019s #1 carbon sink.",
      "We\u2019ve volunteered in reforestation efforts ourselves, but quickly realized that current methods (manual planting, tractors, drones\u2026) simply aren\u2019t restoring forests anywhere near the pace we need. See our FAQ for why.",
      "We couldn\u2019t help but wonder: If fire can tear through a forest in minutes, why does it have to take years even to begin bringing it back?",
      "That question stuck with us. And eventually, Trovador became our answer!",
      "An autonomous robot that can do what no other method today can: reforest steep, burned terrain with speed, precision, and care.",
      "Our first prototype, built from recycled materials, proved the concept and gained global attention. Now we\u2019re building the full-scale version.",
      "What makes Trovador unique:",
      "We\u2019re raising 14,000\u20ac exclusively to finish the full-scale robot: 4-legged platform + planting mechanism (motors, drills, sensors, wiring\u2026).",
      "And if we raise more than our goal? Every extra euro will go into planting more trees or upgrading the robot.",
      "In short: every cent goes directly into making large-scale reforestation possible, whether in Portugal or, eventually, anywhere it's needed.",
      "We know 14,000\u20ac sounds like a lot, and it is. But it\u2019s the necessary amount to make this solution real. For perspective, see the FAQ: \u201cIs 14,000\u20ac really necessary?\u201d",
      "Donate: even 2\u20ac builds momentum.",
      "Share: spreading the word wherever you can is just as powerful!",
      "If everyone reading this tossed a coin our way and got a few friends to do the same, we\u2019d be planting forests in no time!",

      "Have you ever witnessed the growth process of seeds? Yes, MarsPlanter can make seeds germinate without any soil. Just add water and turn on the light module. We recommend using mode one for warm and bright light to encourage seed germination. Once the seeds sprout, they will attach their roots to the surface texture.",

      "The widespread use of digital screens, unhealthy eye habits, lack of physical activity, environmental pollution, the chemical ingredients in cosmetics and skincare products, and the pressures of daily life all pose challenges to our skin and eyes. In response to these issues, we have introduced the powerful Foodmagic 670nm Red Light Therapy Device, also known as the Foodmagic Vision Power Bank. This device is not only designed to improve vision and beauty care but can also be used to treat prickly heat, frostbite, small wounds, and more, thanks to the unique benefits of 670nm red light. It can be used year-round for daily use, effortlessly handling everything even in summer and winter!",
      "This innovative product integrates the dual functions of \"vision protection + beauty and skin care\" by utilizing 670nm red light irradiation to stimulate cell growth and accelerate metabolism. This takes you to a new level of vision and skin care.",
      "Red light has the ability to \"charge\" the mitochondria of retinal photoreceptor cells, reduce the apoptosis rate of age-related cells, and improve the function of photoreceptor cells. Additionally, it can relax the ciliary muscles of the eyes, relieve eye soreness, promote blood circulation around the eyes, enhance retinal cell metabolism, and help restore optimal vision.",
      "This technology has been extensively researched, validated, and widely recognized for its positive effects on preventing myopia in teenagers and slowing down visual decline in middle-aged and elderly individuals. Its vision protection effect is significantly superior to that of rest, massage, and hot compress therapies.",
      "Red light irradiation has been shown to enhance cell metabolism, increase glycogen content, promote protein synthesis and adenosine triphosphate decomposition, as well as stimulate cell regeneration and blood circulation within blood vessels. This makes it great for skincare, such as beauty care, addressing issues like prickly heat, frostbite, and small wounds, and more!",
      "Foodmagic abandons the common red light wave bands including 650nm and 640nm wavelengths in the past. Based on the latest international research theory, the more targeted 670nm red light is selected to repair cells in depth, so as to prevent failing eyesight, alleviate eye fatigue and improve the periocular skin.",
      "The Foodmagic boasts a diffuse reflection plate as one of its key features. This special structural design greatly improves the light receiving uniformity, improves the poor efficacy caused by uneven light radiation density, and greatly enhances the use effect.",
      "It is well established that light of varying wavelengths exhibits distinct absorption peaks in cells. Specifically, the 670nm red light wavelength closely aligns with the absorption peak of cytochrome c oxidase, a critical enzyme in the cell respiratory chain. Consequently, cells more readily absorb 670nm red light, leading to more pronounced biological effects.",
      "Compared to 650nm and 640nm red light, 670nm red light exhibits superior skin and tissue permeability. Its ability to penetrate deeper into ocular and cutaneous tissues allows for direct targeting of specific cells, resulting in more precise and effective therapeutic outcomes.",
      "Recent scientific research has demonstrated that the 670nm red light wavelength possesses distinct advantages in enhancing cellular vitality, improving blood circulation, reducing oxidative stress, and alleviating eye fatigue. These findings provide compelling evidence for our selection of 670nm red light as a more precise phototherapy wavelength.",
      "The Foodmagic exit pupil distance is 40cm/15.76inch, which is comparable to the distance at which one typically reads books, uses mobile phones, and operates computers. This distance is more in line with natural visual habits. Use it at 40cm/15.76inch from your eyes can accurately irradiate the retina and surrounding tissues of the eyes with red light.",
      "During skincare sessions, place the transparent cover in contact with the skin to achieve the best results. This cover, made of safe transparent material, allows the red light emitted by Foodmagic's LED beads to penetrate harmlessly, delivering the best possible outcomes.",
      "Our Foodmagic vision improvement device is suitable for ages 6+. Use it once a day for 3 minutes consistently for 14 days, and you will receive a surprise!",
      "Foodmagic is a lightweight, compact marvel, measuring just 89.67x 61.79 x 23.64mm/3.412x 2.433 x 0.931inch and weighing a mere 89.3g, making it incredibly portable.",
      "Keep it effortlessly accessible on your Rolls-Royce's tray, Microsoft workstation desk, inside a Hermes handbag, on QATAR's cabin table, in your makeup bag, or tucked into a portable pocket - always ready to be picked up and used whenever needed!",
      "For added convenience, we recommend sticking the magnetic plate onto the back of your phone and then attaching the Foodmagic. This allows for seamless integration with your phone's timer function. You can also secure it to any other convenient flat surface.",
      "To power on the Foodmagic, simply press the power button with your finger. Likewise, pressing the power button again with your finger will turn it off when not in use.",
      "350mAh Battery Capacity",

Each use feels like a magical adventure, as the brilliant red light emanates from the power bank, resembling an artifact, illuminating your gaze.",
      "The Foodmagic is not only a highly functional product, but its aluminum alloy casing also showcases excellent heat dissipation, impact resistance, and long-lasting durability.",
      "During the product development process, we have conducted nearly 300 continuous tests and actively sought international certifications to meet safety standards for multiple countries, including FCC, UL, CE, RoHS, IC, GB4706.1, PSE, METI, UN38.3, and more.",
