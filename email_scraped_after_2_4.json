      "Linky is convenient: take with you all you need in our elegant and functional backpack.",
      "Our story with Linky began 8 years ago when we started producing and selling the first version of the foldable electric longboard. Kickstarter was the platform that we used to present our product to the world. Even if we managed to reach more than 80.000$, unfortunately, our first campaign was not successful mostly due to inexperience in marketing and specifically in crowdfunding. We didn't give up, we kept going and with the lesson learned we improved our marketing and managed to find the funding to start the production of Linky. The success of the Linky 1.0 has demonstrated to us that its main feature, the folding system was efficient, resistant, and highly appreciated by our users. The evolution into Linky 2.0 started from there. Our research and development team has been working for about 4 years around the widely tested and approved \"folding system\" to improve the quality of the experience of our customers by providing a real vehicle that could be used as an alternative to cars in the city environment. We started by gathering feedback from the many users of the Linky 1.0 and we came out with a layout of the new product that, from the outside can look quite similar to the first one but, from a technological and UX standpoint represents a complete revolution. The major difficulty has been to improve the product in many aspects while maintaining the portability (weight and dimensions) at the top. The main points of difference and innovation where we focused our studies and investments are the following:",
      "We believe that Linky 2.0 represents not just a product evolution but a revolution in urban mobility. Our dedication to improving upon the original model, coupled with our focus on sustainability and community feedback, underscores our commitment to delivering a transformative product.",
      "Linky is the world pioneer of foldable e-skates. We invented the best folding mechanism, protected by an international patent. The use of high-strength plastic polymers combined with our engineering experience allowed us to make it both sturdy and light.",
      "Linky\u2019s system of joints makes sure that the skate safely remains in the open position during riding. We\u2019ve worked hard on perfecting the opening and closing mechanism so that it is as smooth and easy as possible. The two parts slide pretty effortlessly open. The mechanism takes literally seconds to open and close.",
      "Linky 2.0 delivers a punch with 2x 750W belt motors, propelling you to speeds of 26 MPH / 42 KPH. Glide over urban terrain with our specially designed 105mm wheels, ensuring a smooth, powerful, and exhilarating skate experience.",
      "With Linky\u2019s 160 or 185 Wh long-range batteries, journey up to 14 miles on a single charge. For air travelers, a 99 Wh swappable airline-safe option keeps you moving. Charging regular time is 90 minutes but can be just 30 minutes with Linky\u2019s fast charger (optional). Linky's battery recharges when you brake... so yay for going downhill (slowly)! A USB port allows you to use the board to charge your cell phone.",

      "Full scale home cooking is also possible, but who has the time or the energy?",
      "Look no further: Goyeo Foods Company is finally here.",
      "People all over the world are discovering Korean Fried Chicken, known for its uniquely crispy texture from double frying that holds up to thick sauces and toppings. Double frying takes a lot of set up, cooking time, queueing and a huge cleanup job, especially at home. I don\u2019t know many home cooks that find those steps worthwhile. That\u2019s probably why many families opt for Korean Fried Chicken takeout even when they\u2019re mostly inaccessible and expensive, more so with delivery fees.",

      "Goyeo Foods mixes and sauces help home cooks make cooking great tasting Korean Fried Chicken simple without the mess. Conveniently coat your chicken in a bag instead of using multiple bowls for flour, batter, and bread crumbs. We spent years formulating and focus testing our mixes to balance a crispy texture, spot on flavor, and an easy cooking method. Simply add your favorite chicken pieces to our carefully crafted dry mix, Shake, Fry, and then Sauce for even more flavor. (I like it both ways, with or without our glaze sauce.)",
      "Our carefully formulated mixes and glaze are made to please the pickiest palates of children and adults alike. They strike the right Asian flavor notes without being heavy in salt or sugar.

      "Sometimes, I just crave the umami flavor of our Original Goodness, \u201cO.G.\u201d Korean Crispy Fry. But when I desire an extra boost of flavor, I sauce the easily cooked Korean Fried Chicken with our Sweetie Soy Glaze sauce. It adds an herbal freshness as well as a bit of sweetness and soy flavor umami. We also have a gluten free mix version, \u201cG.F.\u201d Korean Crispy Fry dry mix with a slightly different flavor profile. It\u2019s full of umami taste with less pepper flavor than the \u201cO.G.\u201d dry mix. I know many people who avoid eating gluten for dietary or health reasons. This G.F. mix gives them access to Korean Fried Chicken on their terms.",
      "Each Korean Crispy Fry mix includes two bags that can yield 16 fried chicken pieces. When only wings are desired, a single box can yield 32 pieces. For that flavor boost, add our Sweetie Soy Glaze sauce. A single 17oz bottle can cover easily cooked Korean Fried Chicken with O.G. or G.F. mix that is enough for a party.",
      "We spent years formulating and improving our dry mixes and sauces after each focus taste test. Our last iterations of mix and sauce overwhelmingly achieved positive responses.

Born out of curiosity and necessity, I began collecting as many different vendor information packets, contact cards, automotive \"Techbooks\" (used by paint and body shops), and material safety data sheets (MSDS) as I could get my hands on. This was an almost entirely self-taught and autodidact pursuit of learning through experimentation at the time, before I learned about the field of Industrial Design and was later accepted at design university to receive a formal education.",
      "Even after years of formal academic studies, I learned that many of these techniques still weren't being taught\u2014at least not altogether and in one place.

      "BRUSH GO has undergone over a year of rigorous testing and user validation, earning high satisfaction across our early users. However, for this special patterned edition, the challenges are unique. Each design requires a complex multi-step printing process with high precision, and the defect rate is significantly higher than standard models. To ensure quality and affordability, we must produce in larger batches, which requires substantial upfront commitment. We've carefully curated each design based on user research to appeal to a wide range of styles and preferences. While production complexity and minimum order quantities pose challenges, our team is fully prepared, and we are committed to delivering both individuality and performance with every BRUSH GO.",

      "Your plant's best friend. With horticultural lighting, automated watering & smart-home integration!",
      "Light requirement of plants varies across their growth stages - germination, seedling, vegetative growth and flowering/ fruit bearing stages. It also vastly varies across plant types. Our aim was to make a universal product that could help anyone get the best growth with ease. The solution was to make multi-channel variable spectrum lights. To make it easy to operate, we devised Presets on an app.",
      "Each CURA Light incorporates a majority of full-spectrum white LEDs of a certain specification, a secondary full-spectrum white with another, along with specialized reds and blues. Each Preset is a combination of these wavelengths.",
      "Great for vegetative growth with a healthy root and stem structure, and reduces stretching.",
      "Stimulates photosynthesis and promotes biomass growth, essential for reproductive functions.",
      "There are Presets available for Herbs & Greens, Flowers & Fruits, Germination, Indoor Garden Plants and more. You could also make custom Presets for each plant and share with others.",
      "No more seasonal growing, no more pushing planters to the windows.",
      "With CURA, you could grow around the year like its spring. When provided the ideal wavelengths, plants grow up to 50% faster than being on window sills. With the right lighting and nutrition, plant stems are thicker, leaves have more mass with shorter nodes; you would also notice quicker flowering and fruition.",
      "Growing at home was never so tempting and convenient.",
      "Herbs and greens so fresh, you don't even need to rinse them. Flavors and aroma that takes you back in memories. CURA makes this happen all through the year. Harvest herbs, greens, veggies, berries, and fruits like a Pro, with surprising yields and regularity.",
      "Brighten up the low-lit corners of your home with plants.",
      "CURA by itself is elegant, understated, and appears to be levitating with less visual volume. Its mounts are discrete and suspension components are remarkable in their simplicity. With its jewelry-like leaf motifs and premium textures, CURA will start conversations anywhere.",
      "No more under watering, over watering, forgetfulness, or guesswork.",
      "Within the elegant aluminum enclosure, the CURA Pump contains a peristaltic pump that operates with high precision and low noise. It runs for a few minutes every day - schedule as set with the App - and provides drip watering through the tube to the base of the plant.",
      "Water is drawn from the reservoir, which rests beneath the planter and could suffice for weeks, to cover a vacation. Alternatively, you could draw water from a bottle or another source besides the planter. One CURA pump could service three planters in the vicinity and is daisy-chained to the CURA Light using the included short cable.",

More to come soon...",

      "Besides the Horticulture LEDs in the middle, there's a second set of RGBW LEDs on the edge of the PCB, which can emit up to a million colors and several motion effects. Why? Because RGB colors are fun and are a great way to set the mood for the evening- there's a color for every occasion and every party. Or make it psychedelic with crazy motion effects! Again, make your own presets and share with others using the app.",

With low-power high-PPFD OSRAM LEDs it serves plants well while blending in with living spaces with a warm welcoming glow around your plants.",
      "CURA comes in 3 different sizes: 200mm (8'), 300mm (12')and 400mm (16').",
      "You would choose them based on the canopy spread of the plants. If in doubt, go for a bigger size. With small herbs, CURA 200/300 could cover more than one plant, if kept as a close cluster.  For big house plants, CURA 400 would do great.",
      "Plants come in all shapes and sizes. Planters, even more so.",
      "Our mounts are designed to support the widest range of both, across various corners of the home. All the mounts are made of powder-coated steel and could be set up in seconds. We have built easy height adjustment into all the mounts. The Wall Mount has a ratchet system which operates by turning the thumbscrew while the other two Mounts have a telescopic pole system, which dramatically increases the height within seconds.",

With predominant full-spectrum White LEDs with high-CRI, sprinkled with special wavelengths of Red and Blue, coupled with secondary lenses for downward-only beam, the overall feel is natural and eye-pleasing.",
      "Our PICOs were loved for their daisy-chaining feature; we dialed it up in CURA.",
      "Each CURA light has two bi-directional USB-C ports- either of them could accept power while the other one could pass through the power to the next one.  Each light comes with a 2M long power cable and 0.5m long daisy chain cable. With a supporting power supply - a 5V 3A phone charger in most cases, you could power more than one CURA, in series.",

      "Become part of an exclusive club of Arits founding members",
      "In a world where watches are either affordable but forgettable, or luxurious but unattainable, we saw an opportunity \u2014 a gap that no one dared to fill.",
      "Where are we positioned against other brands?",
      "Arits was born out of a simple question:\nWhy should timeless design and enduring quality only be reserved for the few?",
      "We\u2019re a team of Belgian entrepreneurs, driven by our passion for design, detail and legacy. Our vision? To create a watch that feels like a luxury piece, wears like an everyday essential, and lasts long enough to be passed on to the next generation.",
      "Each Arits timepiece is a blend of refined aesthetics, high-grade materials, and exceptional durability \u2014 crafted with precision and purpose. Whether you're at work, on the golf course, or diving into the weekend, your Arits watch is made to go with you. Everywhere.",
      "We\u2019re not following trends.\nWe\u2019re building something lasting.\nAnd this is just the beginning.",
      "Join us on this journey and be among the first to wear an Arits \u2014 not just a watch, but a statement of timeless ambition.",
      "Sapphire Blue",
      "Deep. Confident. Untouchable.\nSapphire Blue captures the elegance of midnight, with a quiet brilliance that shifts with the light. It\u2019s bold without noise \u2014 made for those who command attention by presence, not volume.\nSophistication, distilled.",
      "British Racing Green",
      "Rich. Historic. Unapologetically bold.\nBritish Racing Green nods to tradition, yet feels entirely modern. It\u2019s the colour of legacy \u2014 of fast lines, sharp tailoring, and long weekends in the countryside.\nDark, decadent, and undeniably classy.",
      "Champagne White",
      "Effortlessly refined. Endlessly versatile.\nChampagne White is the quiet luxury of understatement \u2014 a soft shimmer with golden undertones, like the first pour of something rare. It doesn\u2019t shout; it whispers confidence.\nTimeless, with just the right sparkle.",
      "The box and papers",
      "Every detail matters \u2014 even the ones that don\u2019t go on your wrist.\nEach Arits timepiece comes in a custom-designed presentation box, crafted exclusively for this collection. Inside, you\u2019ll find care instructions and a signed certificate of authenticity. Nothing off the shelf. Everything considered.\nBecause refinement begins long before the first wear.",
      "The Arits from every angle",
      "Case Size \u2013 39mm",
      "Arits is designed to feel just right on the wrist. At 39mm, the case offers a timeless silhouette \u2014 not too bold, not too subtle. It\u2019s a size chosen for its balance between elegance and presence. Whether dressed up or worn casually, it adapts effortlessly. Built to suit every moment of your day.",
      "Movement \u2013 SW200-1 (SELLITA)",
      "At the heart of each Arits watch ticks a Swiss-made SW200-1 automatic movement. Known for its reliability and precision, it's a favorite among true watch enthusiasts. The movement features a 6H date complication, adding subtle functionality. It\u2019s built for the long run \u2014 just like the design that surrounds it. No battery, no shortcuts, just honest mechanical craftsmanship.",
      "Accuracy",
      "Every Arits watch is factory-adjusted in two positions for dependable performance. The SW200-1 offers a daily accuracy between +12 and +30 seconds \u2014 well within Swiss standards. It's a mechanical movement, built with tolerances that reflect real-world usage. Consistency over perfection, reliability over marketing talk. Just the way we like it.",
      "Watch Thickness \u2013 9.6mm",
      "We\u2019ve kept it slim, without losing the mechanical soul. At just 9.6mm, Arits slides effortlessly under a cuff \u2014 while still feeling substantial on the wrist. It\u2019s the kind of thickness that says restraint, not compromise. Form meets function in every curve. And you\u2019ll feel it from the first wear.",
      "Waterproof \u2013 10 ATM / 100 meters",
      "This is not a watch you\u2019ll need to baby. With 10 ATM (100 meters) of water resistance, Arits is built to go beyond the everyday. Whether you're caught in the rain or taking a swim, it's ready. Functional doesn\u2019t have to mean bulky \u2014 and we prove that. Understated, yet capable.",
      "Case Material \u2013 316L Stainless Steel",
      "Durability starts with the right material. That\u2019s why we use 316L stainless steel \u2014 known for its corrosion resistance and beautiful finish. It\u2019s what gives Arits its confident weight and enduring shine. This case won\u2019t just last, it will age with grace. A foundation for decades of wear.",
      "Crystal \u2013 Sapphire Glass with 7x AR Coating",
      "Clarity is essential. Arits uses sapphire crystal \u2014 one of the hardest and most scratch-resistant materials in watchmaking. We add seven layers of anti-reflective coating for crisp readability in any light. No glare, no distortion, just pure visibility. What you see is what you get.",
      "Power Reserve \u2013 36 hours",
      "The SW200-1 keeps ticking long after you take it off. With a 36-hour power reserve, Arits easily carries you through the weekend. It\u2019s the kind of freedom mechanical watch lovers appreciate.",
      "Dial",
      "The sunray dial plays with light in all the right ways \u2014 elegant, without trying too hard. Applied indices offer depth, while Super Swiss Luminova TC-C1 \"Grade X1\" ensures visibility long after sunset. It\u2019s readable, refined, and full of subtle detail. The kind of dial you catch yourself staring at. Every day, a little different.",
      "Hands",
      "Our nickel hands are precision-cut and perfectly finished. Like the dial, they\u2019re filled with Super Swiss Luminova \u201cGrade X1\u201d \u2014 so you never lose time, even in the dark. They\u2019re slim, balanced, and designed to disappear when they should \u2014 and shine when they need to. This is minimalism with intention. Less flash, more focus.",
      "Clasp \u2013 Butterfly Closure",
      "A perfect close to the Arits experience. The butterfly clasp offers a secure fit and a clean look on the wrist. It clicks shut with precision and opens with ease \u2014 no pinching, no pulling. Just a satisfying, smooth motion. Elegant function, hidden in plain sight.",
      "By supporting Arits on Indiegogo, you\u2019re not just helping us bring a watch to life \u2014 you\u2019re becoming part of our story.",
      "Your contribution helps us fund the first production run, secure premium materials, and scale our mission to redefine what luxury truly means.",
      "And in return?\nYou\u2019ll be among the very first to own an Arits timepiece \u2014 at an exclusive backer price of \u20ac795 (instead of the future retail price of \u20ac1.400). This is a limited opportunity to invest in craftsmanship, style, and something that lasts.",
      "As a crowdfunder, you\u2019ll also get:\n\u2714\ufe0f Priority delivery\n\u2714\ufe0f Exclusive updates & behind-the-scenes access\n\u2714\ufe0f A direct line to our founders and design process\n\u2714\ufe0f Your name etched into the foundation of a timeless brand",

We\u2019re truly sorry for this, but to ensure we can deliver your MerinoTech Vest 2.0 reliably and without compromise, we have to charge these rates. We hope you understand that every cent goes directly into making this project possible, and we deeply appreciate your support in helping an independent brand grow the right way.",

Everyone knows all good products start with a \u201cnapkin sketch\u201d. Take a look at some of our initial sketches that show the different styles, sizes and shapes we thought about offering.",
      "After we narrowed down the selection of sketches we liked, we started to work on shapes for the bottle and what type of lid to use. Check out some of the ideas we played around with.",
      "Once we had these sketches finalized, we explored volumes and turned the sketches into CAD drawings to understand sizing, details and to learn more about the mechanics of the bottle. Images of this can be seen in update #3.",

      "Below you can see how the processing logic will flow on the board and how all the pieces will connect and talk to each other:",
      "Once the circuit boards were fitted to the bottle and printed, the components were placed onto the board and the firmware was written to make it all work together!",

Our customized high performance ripstop fabric is so soft that the bags practically disappear in your pocket, you don\u2019t even have to fold it, ever. Yet these bags can carry up to 66 lbs (30 kg) and thanks to the 3-layered handles they\u2019re also comfortable to use.",

We already consider our bags environmentally conscious, as they contain less materials than other bags in their category and offset single use plastic bags. In addition, for each bag sold we\u2019ll plant one tree with Eden Reforestation. Trees are effective tools for removing carbon from the atmosphere. As an example, a mangrove tree can store up to 1750lbs (800kg) of CO2 over its growth life. As an added bonus trees also prevent soil erosion and help sustain ecosystems.",

All parcels will be shipped with tracked air mail.",

The Nanobag 6.0 has been developed and tested over the past few months and we are confident that we can do a good job with this. As with every project, there can always be unforeseen things along the way, but we've done our best to mitigate potential problems. Final products may differ slightly from the prototypes seen in the campaign as our bags are continually being developed and improved. Except stated otherwise please note that customers are responsible for taxes and duties that may be imposed on the shipments by their respective countries. We promise you that we're 100% committed to the project and that we\u2019ll keep you updated every step of the journey. Our goal is to satisfy every backer.",

    "allParagraphs": [
      "The Indiegogo campaign has come to an end. Now you can order HUDWAY Drive at hudway.co.",
      "Meet HUDWAY Drive, the heads-up display designed for you to enjoy everyday commutes and long journeys to the unfamiliar places \u2014 with maps, directions, incoming calls, messages and notifications projected through your windshield.",
      "HUDWAY Drive is our third hardware product since 2015. It was built through numerous rounds of R&D, prototyping, testing, revisions, based on the vast feedback from our community \u2014 and today we're happy to introduce it to you.",
      "All that you've been asking for \u2014 simple installation, quick set-up and pairing, troubleproof connection, reliable complementary software, ability to use any app of your choice \u2014 is made real with HUDWAY Drive. Which, in our opinion, makes it the best & most powerful heads-up display among existing aftermarket models. And it's the most affordable as well.",
      "HUDWAY Drive is serving the modern driver, someone on the go who needs to stay connected without sacrificing their safety or the safety of others, with something that can't be found anywhere else.",
      "It's for those looking to upgrade the vehicles they already own with a heads-up display \u2014 at a fraction of the price charged for built-in OEM solutions, and with a more advanced functionality.",
      "It's for the daily commuter, the traveler on the move, the mothers and fathers. It's for drivers everyday, everywhere.",
      "Search for places in the app and navigate there with concise directions floating in front of your eyes. Follow timely voice hints on upcoming manoeuvres. Powered by MapBox.",
      "See when someone is calling you and accept the call the way you normally do. If you have a Voice Assistant button on the steering wheel, a Bluetooth headset, or Apple Watch, you can connect it to your phone and respond to calls this way. Otherwise, you will need to pick up your phone.",
      "View messages and other notifications from your phone projected through your windshield \u2014 it\u2019s automated, no extra actions are needed. Preset what you want to see on the head-up display and leave out all the rest.",
      "Customize your driving experience with the dashboard widgets:  pitching and rolling, GPS speedometer, clock, weather, ETA, compass, eco driving index, and more.",
      "Listen to the voice directions played on your smartphone, Bluetooth headphones, or car media system \u2014 and receive phone calls hands-free.",
      "One of the most exciting things about an aftermarket heads-up display is its portability. You purchase one, and can take it from one vehicle to another. And this calls for a versatile design that would look good on any vehicle dashboard, as well as for a thought-out mounting system.",
      "The HUDWAY Drive mount is one of our favorite innovations. Not only it affixes neatly and securely to almost every vehicle dash, but also makes using the device hassle-free.",
      "Flexible flaps follow the dash curves",
      "From our previous experience we know how important it is to mount the device firmly on the dash. In our earlier devices, we tried to achieve it with selecting a very flexible base material that would adjust to the curves, but that was not sufficient for some very curvy dashes. In HUDWAY Drive, we've built a mount that consists of more components \u2014 base and sectional flaps. Such construction allows for better flexibility and closer adhesion.",
      "Provided that it's affixed firmly, the mount absorbs dash vibration \u2014 so that it doesn't interfere with viewing the projected information, which used to be an issue reported by some of the customers of our earlier devices.",
      "As for adhesive on the base of the mount \u2014 as usual, it's very strong and will keep the device in place on all sorts of dash surfaces, except for suede-like ones. And it leaves no traces when removed.",
      "The cables run straight to the mount not to the device",
      "This means, you only need to deal with wires once, when you first install HUDWAY Drive. After you install the device, plug the cable in the mount power port, secure the cable with dash clips, hide it between the dash and the windshield, then thread it behind the driver's seat to further plug it in the cigarette lighter receptacle. So, whenever you need to use the device, just plug the cable in the cigarette lighter receptacle, and it will power on automatically.",
      "Same is true for connecting the cameras \u2014 the video input port is located on the mount.",
      "Slide-in mechanism to easily dismount the device",
      "There may be situations, when you want to drive without the device on the dash, or remove it when parking the car \u2014 or you may want to use it on your other vehicle (there will be extra mounts available for purchase later). Anyway, the slide-in mechanism makes removing the device and placing it back very quick and simple.",
      "By now, we have manufactured a small test batch and took the device to a range of vehicles to see how it would fit in the most popular models \u2014 and on some of the most challenging dashboards. It did awesome. See for yourself:",

      "HUDWAY Drive has a video input (CVBS) port to connect a camera to it \u2014 sounds simple, but let's dig in detail to see why we consider it a supervaluable addition to HUDWAY Drive \u2014 and how it can augment your driving experience.",
      "The rearview camera automatically turns on when selecting the reverse gear. It's equipped with rear parking distance sensors and and LED lights.",
      "Parking sensors measure the distance to the obstacles. Lights ensure that you get a legible video of what\u2019s behind the vehicle when it\u2019s dark.",
      "Not only the camera displays the video of what's behind the rear bumper, but also visualizes the space around the vehicle alerting on the proximity to the obstacles.",
      "The viewing angle is 170\u00b0, and the waterproof rating is IP69 (will withstand any weather conditions).",
      "Sideview camera allows you to control blind spots when turning or overtaking. The video starts streaming automatically when your turn signal is on.",
      "We recommend that the side view cameras are installed on the fender close to the front door gap. This way, it involves no drilling of the body, and the wires can be hidden more neatly.",
      "The viewing angle is 120\u00b0, and the waterproof rating is IP69 (will withstand any weather conditions). Each of these cameras can be used as front/rear/left/right side view camera according to your need.",
      "Night vision thermal camera displays the objects ahead that are otherwise beyond your headlights reach.",
      "It detects heat from the objects without a need for light, allowing you to see up to four times farther down the road. You\u2019ll have visibility through dust, smoke, or fog, and better capability to avoid an accident.",
      "With the operating temperature range of -40 \u00b0F to 155 \u00b0F (-40 \u00b0C to 70 \u00b0C) and IP67 waterproof rating, the camera will withstand most extreme weather conditions.",
      "Each camera set comes with a video selector unit so that you can preset which video signal you want to appear on HUD \u2014 and with a remote control to actually configure such a preset.",
      "The cameras connect to video selector using S-video cables \u2014 these allow to power the cameras and transmit the video signal. Then, you'll need to plug the RCA cable running from the video selector unit in HUDWAY Drive \u2014 and hide all the wires.",
      "Note: Please note that installing cameras, especially the night vision one, may require a qualified specialist. Detailed information and instructions how to connect the cameras are posted in one of our updates.",
      "At the moment, HUDWAY Drive is on a prototype stage. But it's a prototype ready for production.",
      "We have selected the vendors and component suppliers, signed the manufacturing contracts \u2014 and even prepaid the tooling for major components. Production and assembly will be done in China by our trusted partners.",
      "To launch mass production and maintain the pricing we offer, we need a large order \u2014 and we're asking you to join in and contribute to that amount.\n\nProduction leadtime is 2 months since the end of the crowdfunding campaign, which is why the delivery date is set to August.",
      "We do not foresee any major risk factors or complications. As usual, the lens is the most complicated component to manufacture and get ready for assembly. Luckily, we've been dealing with HUD lenses since 2015, and know well how to make them great.",
      "Join in, back the project \u2014 and rest assured, we will deliver.",
      "Many of the customers of HUDWAY Cast (our earlier device) ask us how HUDWAY Drive is different from that. In short, HUDWAY Drive addresses most of the issues the users of both our earlier devices faced. The key differences are:",
      "HUDWAY Drive connects to the smartphone via Bluetooth, which is quick, hassle-free and reliable. With this type of connection you will be able to use navigation powered by MapBox and driving widgets. Also, incoming calls and notifications will be fetched and visualised to HUD \u2014 and sound will be played via the output source you select.",
      "Alternatively, you can mirror any application (your exact phone screen contents) to HUD. This is how you can view Waze, Google Maps, or any other app on HUD. This time we're using a different way to do the mirroring \u2014 and not relying on AirPlay or Miracast. However, the latter two will be still supported in HUDWAY Drive.",
      "Learn more on the connection options in the Help Center.",
      "HUDWAY Drive uses an extra slim and flexible mount which follows the curves of your dash and looks integral to the vehicle interior. And \u2014 it now fits in the vehicles where there\u2019s very little space between the dash and the windshield (like in some BMW models).",
      "The lens is now also smaller and flatter, of a much better quality and with more advanced coatings \u2014 thus, the projection will not be blurry or distorted.",
      "HUDWAY Drive affixes to the mount using a slide-in lock, and the power cable plugs in the mount not in the device, which is why it\u2019s now easier to take the device off and place it back.",
      "The mount also absorbs vehicle vibration which was the issue reported by some of HUDWAY Cast users.",
      "For those using additional cameras in their vehicles, HUDWAY Drive offers a video input port (CVBS) which was impossible with HUDWAY Cast.",
      "By default, HUDWAY Drive uses navigation and routes provided by MapBox. Alternatively, you can use HUDWAY Go or any other app (using screen mirroring) if you choose to.\n\nOn the whole, HUDWAY Drive is superior to HUDWAY Cast in terms of functionality, design and usability.",
      "Having started in 2013, we've been focusing on a very specific range of solutions \u2014 HUD & ADAS software and hardware products. This is our core competence.",
      "It is our mission to bring safety on the road through ongoing innovations, and we keep improving and enhancing our products to make this possible. Today, the HUDWAY team consists of 40 members in 4 countries around the world.",

      "GRiSP 2 is a combination of embedded hardware and software aiming at being the best prototyping solution for Erlang and Elixir developers.",
      "The first version of the GRiSP board was and is still used extensively for a wide range of applications like custom made home automation systems, teaching, European research projects, and even industrial prototyping.",
      "Traditional embedded development is done with low level languages or specialized virtual machines and language subsets. Many problems become hard to solve in such environments. Properties like fault tolerance, debugging and tracing, test and iterate are hard to implement. The GRiSP platform solves these problems by bringing native Erlang and Elixir into the embedded world. You can now get the full fault tolerance properties from Erlang and its supervision structure. Debugging and tracing is easy and fast, and can be performed against live hardware and existing systems. Testing and iterative development is more fun and flexible with features such as hot code loading.",
      "Getting into embedded development can be a daunting task for high-level language developers. There are many hardware platforms and configurations out there. Learning new or specialized languages that have special limitations reduces productivity and comes at a cost. Picking an option and setting up environments is a painful process. What if you could program embedded systems using normal Erlang and Elixir and their standard tools? With GRiSP that becomes a real possibility. We have taken a layered approach to the hardware API so you can interact with the hardware and peripheral drivers through pure Erlang. You can keep using any existing libraries that you are used to, since the VM is the same as you would run on any other platform. GRiSP lets you venture out into the world of embedded development using your existing skillset!",
      "The GRiSP 2 board will be the natural evolutionary next step for our GRiSP 1 board. We have overcome design pitfalls and optimized our hardware, and all we learned will be put into GRiSP 2 by design.",

      "The Erlang virtual machine is compiled together with the real-time abstraction layer The Real-Time Executive for Multiprocessor Systems (RTEMS) Real Time Operating System (RTOS). This allows Erlang to work directly with the hardware without any layer in-between. Drivers or NIFs implemented in C can process signals with stringent deadlines and together with Erlang\u2019s excellent soft real-time properties can make for a very snappy hardware system.",
      "Towards Hard Real-Time",
      "We are also working on research to bring hard real-time to the embedded Erlang world. Working with C drivers in your Erlang system can already give you hard real-time benefits, but we want to make this accessible from Erlang directly without requiring any low-level knowledge. Once mature, this will be part of our future software stack and feature set.",
      "Nerves and Linux",
      "In addition to running Erlang bare-metal, GRiSP 2 supports the Nerves platform on Linux. This greatly widens the range of embedded applications that can be prototyped and deployed on GRiSP 2 hardware.",
      "Improved Input/Output",
      "The GRiSP 2 hardware has been carefully designed to improve the IO contentions that we detected in the first version. We added an on-board Ethernet port, to increase the number of ways you can interact with the board via networking.",
      "Modular Design",
      "The GRiSP 2 hardware is designed with a SoM (System on Module) on top of an IO break-out board. When designing a production board after the prototyping phase, the same SoM can be reused and only the IO board need customisation. This greatly reduces the cost of designing production hardware.",
      "Tooling",
      "GRiSP 2 comes with a complete toolchain to create and deploy embedded projects using Erlang or Elixir. There is also automated tooling support for creating custom builds of the Erlang VM that include your own custom C drivers or any other included C code that you may need.",
      "We want to make it as easy and painless as possible to deploy embedded projects with Erlang. It should feel as close as possible to a normal Erlang project and our tooling is there to help you with all steps in the process.",
      "Backward Compatibility",
      "The GRiSP 2 hardware and software suite is fully backward compatible with the Erlang code developed for the first version.",
      "Risks and Concerns",
      "During development of the first GRiSP board we have learned a lot. Initially we did have issues with Wi-Fi connectivity due to antenna problems and the USB controller stealing too much CPU cycles to make Wi-Fi work. The still outstanding issues will of course be fixed in this version, but unforeseen problems can still occur with hardware components. In addition, there could be problems in manufacturing or shortage of component parts.",
      "We have the experience from manufacturing the previous board and are not deviating too much from that. We have also selected common components that are in good supply to avoid any production chain hiccups. Therefore we foresee a very stable production with only minimal risk.",

      "RiiTurn Spring backpack: Weight reduction + Breathability + large Volume =for Travel & Business Work",
      "Walking around with a backpack on your back for a long time will make your back and shoulders feel painful, and develop poor posture easily. The backpack will make your back muscles sag, getting tighter so that the stress constantly builds up in your neck and shoulders.",
      "Designed with a combination of Air BackWave System and Bunggi System, the RiiTURN backpack can unleash your best energy by alleviating backpack weight.",
      "Check out what our early reviewers said about RiiTURN:",
      "Made from alloy, the spring supports help remove extra heat and moisture in your back to keep it clean and dry, giving you a comfortable experience.",
      "The elastic and spring mechanisms move as you move, which contributes to positive temperature regulation. This means that whether you are heading on a business trip, checking into the office or going for a long-term trip, you will feel more comfortable than you ever think.",
      "With backpack weight hugely lifted by the springs, a mesh cover will make your backpack experience airy as if you are moving with a parachute. A mesh cover between your back and the springs also give you a sense of easiness.",
      "An hourglass design spring with nine layers, which is perfectly sensible to your body, and has super flexibility to suit your back curves. The upper layer will boost the dynamic of your waist and back. The Middle layer supports the main weight of the body and reduces spinal pressure. The lower layer also assures a solid base. No worry about losing the springs.",
      "Unlike regular backpack straps, the RiiTURN backpack\u2019s straps are made in visible polymer, which contains 30 DPI holes with 20-25mm thickness, making air easily come in and out. Bungee strap gives you an airy-style backpacking experience.",
      "Curved half-moon shape design in both sides of the straps provides more space to move your shoulders' muscles, making you relaxed and enjoyable while walking.",
      "RiiTURN Backpack helps you to reduce pressure through four springs on each strap. Automatically adjust according to strength and angle when you encounter external impact and pressure.",
      "With these systems, you will get a perfect combination of back support and hip support, spreading the weight of the backpack across your entire body so that you are carrying it with all of your muscles, not just a few.",
      "My name is Michael Xu, from Kingting Tech Inc. For the past 20+ years, I have been traveling to major cities around the world, meeting clients and partners, and traveling and hiking with a backpack. But every time I put on my backpack for about 30 minutes, my back starts to get hot and sweaty and smells so bad, you can imagine how important the first impression is and how awkward the meeting is. This caused me to have to carry my backpack on one shoulder, although I know that long-term one-shoulder backpacking is dangerous to my spinal health, because every time I carry my backpack on one shoulder, I have to hunch my back, with one shoulder muscle tensed and raised (to prevent the backpack from slipping) and the other shoulder lowered. For this reason, I had to go to the hospital to treat my recurring cervical and lumbar spine pain problems, and in one serious case, a coughing fit caused radiated pain in my lumbar spine. My left and right meniscus were determined to be Grade II after an MRI, so I had to slow myself down for treatment, which was not only expensive but also a painful process.",
      "After brainstorming ideas in the first six months of 2019, we finally used different types of lightweight springs to build: Air BackWave + Bunggi two systems, Air BackWave can make us walk around, using the vibration of the backpack, airflow continues to circulate and take away heat and sweat, the back is no longer hot and drier, Bunggi can reduce the impact of each step on our shoulders, the pressure is reduced, our muscle compression and blood flow caused by cervical spine problems are also reduced.",
      "Luckily, the RiiTURN backpack allows me to straighten my back and raise my head to get along with the backpack in a healthy posture, restoring my cervical and lumbar spine to a healthy posture. When I breathe, all the springs deform as my chest expands, allowing more space for oxygen intake, so I can breathe in a more relaxed way, reducing fatigue and having more energy to focus on the thing.",

      "I started Soreem out of self-rebellion \u2014 it was my way of finally speaking for myself, of healing, and of creating a world that made room for people who felt like me. No investors. No roadmap. Just a dream stitched together by courage, creativity, and community. Over the years, Soreem has grown from a streetwear vision into a full-bodied creative platform that inspires others to live freely, dress boldly, and walk in their truth.",
      "Now, I\u2019m preparing for the next chapter \u2014 one that honors all the evolution and purpose that\u2019s gotten me here. With your help, I can bring a milestone vision to life that expands what Soreem is and who it\u2019s for.",

      "I\u2019m raising $10,526.32 to bring Soreem\u2019s next phase to life. This funding will cover:",
      "The amount also includes a 5% buffer for Indiegogo fees, ensuring that the full project receives what it truly needs.",
      "As a thank-you, I\u2019ve created a range of digital and physical perks that align with the spirit of Soreem and this project\u2019s world. From heartfelt thank-you notes and digital wallpapers, to exclusive early access to visuals, merch, and even tickets to the next Soreem event \u2014 these perks are intentional, meaningful, and curated just for this community.",

I\u2019ll continue to secure in-kind support, collaborate with nonprofits, host community fundraisers, and apply for grants and residencies to push the vision forward.",
      "Soreem has never just been about clothes \u2014 it\u2019s about storytelling, self-expression, and creative liberation.",
      "In a world that constantly asks us to shrink, Soreem invites us to expand \u2014 to wear our truths, to unearth our voices, and to move through life like the art we are. Your contribution helps us continue creating powerful visuals, garments, and experiences that awaken something in people \u2014 something deeply personal and deeply shared.",

      "With your help, we\u2019re not just making art \u2014 we\u2019re building a new language for fashion and storytelling.",
      "My biggest challenge is raising this funding before September 2025 to meet key deadlines for design production, collaborative projects, and rollout. While I\u2019ve received incredible in-kind support from venues and promo partners, many corporations who love the vision simply don\u2019t have the budget right now.",
      "But I\u2019ve always found a way.",
      "I\u2019ve created shows with no budget, launched projects with nothing but heart, and built communities from scratch. I plan to overcome financial challenges by continuing to partner with local orgs, barter services, host community fundraisers, and scale in phases if necessary.",
      "This is a leap \u2014 but one I\u2019ve prepared for with a solid plan and a fearless sense of purpose.",

    "description": "Get lasting relief with probiotics that reduce inflammation & sinusitis. Safe and easy to use!",
    "company_name": "Marc Palumbo",
    "allParagraphs": [
      "Get lasting relief with probiotics that reduce inflammation & sinusitis. Safe and easy to use!",
      "Sure Sinus helps remove your body's tendency to enact excessive defense mechanism by balancing your sinus biome.",
      "If you\u2019re suffering from sinusitis or inflammation issues, it may be because you have an unbalanced sinus biome. You\u2019re missing key probiotics, or the good bacteria needed to fight off the bad bacteria.",
      "Without key probiotics, your body is unable to fight off bad bacteria effectively. Instead, it has to fight hard to keep itself in balance.",
      "They help your body find the balance between necessary and excessive defense mechanisms (aka all that pain you feel).",
      "Sure Sinus reintroduces the good bacteria, helping to balance your sinus biome and assisting in regulating your body's immune response.",
      "\"I have only used Sure Sinus for a short period of time, but have already seen improvement in my sinus drainage and inflammation. This product has helped me overcome a severe cycle of infection. I am excited to see how my results improve with continued use.\"",
      "\"I have already noticed a bit of improvement. So I think this program may work if I stick with it over the long term as this has been a problem of long standing. In any case it shows more promise than anything I have tried so far. I think that over time it may perhaps break up whatever is causing the problem up in the sinuses. I am hopeful and have ordered 16 vials of 30 doses each.\"",
      "\"If you have sinus problems, you simply have to try Sure Sinus. I wouldn't have believed it if I didn\u2019t. With near-instant relief and a drastic reduction in inflammation, I could feel it essentially repairing my nose over the course of the treatment. After a lifetime of abuse from prior measures, this was unbelievable. Being 2019, I would have expected every solution for such a seemingly simple problem to have been already identified and exhausted. Honestly, I wouldn\u2019t have believed it if I hadn\u2019t used Sure Sinus first hand. I wouldn\u2019t have believed my sinuses could feel the way they do now.\"",
      "These bacteria produce vitamins and nutrients, boost immune response and protect against carcinogens and unhealthy bacteria.",
      "A diverse mixture is very important to a healthy biome.",
      "Repeat this process every day for the full 30-day process. Depending on the severity of suffering and sinus symptoms, some users see results within 1-2 days.",
      "The proprietary blend of bacteria is both more potent and healthier when kept cold. True cold-chain storage and fulfillment ensures the best results. Shipping price displayed is for the 1-pack option.",
      "One 30-day program is enough for the average individual. Users who suffer from more severe symptoms should expect to need more than 30 doses for relief.",
      "It is recommended to pre-order multiple 30-day programs and store for future use, should your biome becomes unbalanced again.",
      "Depending on your history and disease process, some suffers find further benefit from multiple doses per day during the rebalancing of the biome.",
      "Sure Sinus is more than just a probiotic, the company has created a platform that will allow users to have access to a private forum with doctors and sinus experts. The forum will allow those suffering from Rhinitis symptoms to ask any questions or concerns to medical professionals and fellow sufferers regarding their respective symptoms. The platform will offer a community for chronic suffers to interact with each other and professionals on an ongoing basis.  The forum will be live this year for the end of this campaign.",
      "Sure Sinus was created after our founder found that his own symptoms of chronic sinusitis had become so serious that he considered walking away from his passion for business. Instead of giving up, he put his head down to personally research and navigate his way through the maze of sinusitis cures. It was during this period that he discovered research that pointed him towards probiotics as a potential way to help relieve the chronic symptoms of  sinusitis.",
      "After several years of research, he was able to settle on his own proprietary mixture of probiotic strains of Lactobacillus that, per his own biohacking and experimentation, helped alleviate the myriad symptoms of his chronic sinusitis. Marc had put together a combination that changed his life\u2014an actual, tangible and consistent solution for just about anyone suffering from both acute and chronic versions of sinusitis.",
      "Since then, he has had his eyes up and his clear-as-day nose to the ground building out Sure Sinus as a product that is able to help millions. He set out to build a team, who have since commenced with research and product development. That team has built the product you see today that is available now on a global basis. Your product will arrive immediately following the end of this campaign.",
      "We ship worldwide. See reward details for shipping costs. Prices exclude any local duties or sales tax.",
      "We plan to ship the product mid/end of October 2019. We will keep you up to date on our progress and the expected delivery date of your order. Actual ship dates may vary.",

Not intended to replace current medical treatment. Please consult your doctor before use. The doctors referenced in support of the product are those mentioned in the campaign page.",
      "Sure Sinus manipulates the sinus microbiome to restore immune homeostasis. Sure Sinus works to prevent dysbiosis, or microbial imbalance, within your sinus microbiome. It works with your body to solidify the mucosal immunology of the respiratory membranes in your sinus cavity.",
      "The nature and composition of bacteria present in the sinus biome are important contributors to the development of host defenses against infection and allergic reaction. Data shows that probiotic supplementation modulates immune responses and can help lessen symptoms. Probiotics help your body find the balance between necessary and excessive defense mechanisms.",
      "Using scientifically-backed ingredients, Sure Sinus is primarily composed of 4 different strains of Lactobacilli. Beneficial varieties of this bacteria produce vitamins and nutrients, boost immune response and protect against carcinogens and unhealthy bacteria.",
      "The mixture of species developed for Sure Sinus are all naturally part of the human sinus biome, as either a keystone (has a disproportionately large effect on the community), a pioneer (are the first to colonize the niche after a disruption), or a dominant (a relatively high abundance in most people) species. The right mixture is very important to a healthy biome.",
      "The chosen strains have been found to be safe, and conducive to restoring your body\u2019s sinus biome to its native state. Having a sinus biome that is out of balance leads to many common symptoms of both acute and chronic sinusitis. Scientific studies have shown that sinus inflammation is associated with decreased sinus bacterial diversity and the then collateral enrichment of specific sinus pathogens. The included species have been shown to competitively exclude the habitation of certain harmful bacteria.",
      "The probiotics within Sure Sinus primarily act through the production of antimicrobial compounds. For example, one included strain produces the protein reuterin, which acts as an antimicrobial compound by inducing oxidative stress in competing bacteria. The effects of this protein are aimed at eliminating competing microbes, giving the good bacteria an advantage in righting the biome.",
      "Intranasal administration is key in regulating respiratory immune responses. Probiotic administration directly into the sinus biome can influence the host composition and function via antimicrobial production, changing PH levels, or through competitive colonization.",
      "Sure Sinus is based on revolutionary research into the composition, modulation, and health of the human sinus biome.",

      "Botanium was first revealed on Kickstarter early 2017. In only 5 days we were fully funded with 1420 backers from all over the world. In the end of same year we shipped around 2500 units to 65 different countries. We are now ready to launch our second product - Botanium Vega.",
      "Botanium Vega is minimalistically designed self-watering planter that enables you to grow herbs and veggies using soil-less growing technology.",
      "Plant a seed, plug it in and you can leave it alone for weeks as it takes care of the plant for you. You get more productive plants and there is no need to worry about over or under watering, the most common ways to kill plants.",
      "There is a rising demand for ways to grow your own food. In a modern busy life, tending to a plant\u2019s needs might be your last priority. And even if you do have time, you might not know how to keep it alive. Enjoy growing herbs or chili without effort. Botanium Vega takes care of the plant for you, thanks to automated, soil-free growing. Botanium Vega comes with a wider design than its predecessor with room for up to four plants.",
      "Vega features a water tank with room for 5 liter (1.3 gallon) of water. Compared with our first Botanium, this is 5x the volume and 25% more water per plant. (if you grow four plants in it). Thanks to this, the water lasts for many weeks.",
      "Vega automatically waters your plants multiple times per day. We have also made it possible to change this schedule so that you can make it water every hour or just once every day.",
      "Botanium Vega uses soil-less - so called hydroponic - gardening technology to grow plants from seed. This has many advantages - the plants can grow larger using less roots, and they will also regrow quicker after harvest.",
      "This also enables the Vega to automatically water the plants without needing to measure the moisture in the soil.",
      "By popular request, our new Botanium Vega is connected to your smartphone using the Botanium app. Use it to get notifications when you need to refill it, and to monitor your Botanium when you are away from home.",
      "We also include a powerful 20 watt LED growing light that enables you to grow anywhere - even during the dark winter. It can be adjusted in height and controlled through the Botanium app.",
      "Hydroponics is simply growing without soil. The roots need water, nutrients and oxygen, all of which can be provided in a more efficient way than in soil. Botanium's porous growing medium absorbs a lot of water, while also providing an aerated environment for the roots.",
      "The benefits of this are not only quicker growth and more control, but also a simpler approach to growing.",
      "The great thing about hydroponics is that you can never overwater the plants you grow. Therefore, you don't need to take into account things like letting the soil dry out before watering again (and not waiting too long so your plants wilt).\n\n  All you need to do is to fill the reservoir when you see the water level getting low. The water lasts several week (depending on the plant, light and heat)",
      ">",
      "At Botanium, we believe that gardening should be simple and available to everyone, even to those living in a city or without much time to take care of a plant. We want to change how greens and herbs are produced indoors, making it possible to bring out the gardener in everyone.",
      "Grow basil",
      "Basil grows quite fast and is a good alternative for the impatient grower. As it needs a lot of water, it thrives in the Botanium where it gets watered often and evenly.",
      "Grow tomatoes",
      "Like its' relatives chili peppers, potatoes and tobacco, tomatoes originate from South America. It is a fast growing plant that thrives in hydroponic systems like Botanium.",
      "Grow chili",
      "What makes chili growing so rewarding is that even a small amount of chili lasts a long time \u2013 in contrast to strawberries for instance, which you easily can eat faster than it grows.",
      "You can also grow rocket salad, thyme, oregano, strawberries, mint and much much more.",
      "Botanium Vega features a 20 watt growing light that is adjustable in height. So as your plants grow you can unscrew the knob and adjust the light accordingly.",
      "The lamp is equipped with state-of-the-art LEDs that are attached to a lamp screen made of extruded aluminum. This screen does not only eliminates glare, but also works as a powerful heatsink that makes it possible to run the LEDs cool - making them run efficently at 175 lumen per watt.",
      "The lamp can be removed if you have a sunny window and you don't need the extra light.",
      "When talking with Botanium users, it was clear that a highly requested feature was app connectivity. And we listened! From the very start, it was important for us to make an app only if it made sense, and if it could be useful. We didn't want to create an app that is just another gimmick. The Botanium Vega has optimized default settings in place that doesn't require you to use the app - but it does add extra controls and features.",
      "The Botanium app is connected to Vega with wi-fi, so you can keep track of your grow wherever you are.",
      "Water level",
      "Keep track of the current water level and get notified when the water level runs low. If you plan to be away from home a few weeks, you can easily check if you need to refill before leaving.",

This style \u2013 often referred to as minimalist \u2013 developed during the Second World War, with clean, simple lines and a strong emphasis on functionality. A common theme in this tradition is that beautiful and functional objects should be available to all.",
      "Botanium Vega consists of a 5 liter water tank and a growing container. A water pump moves water up to top, and distributes it evenly over the growing medium. It trickles down and returns back to the water tank, so it later can be reused.",
      "Dimensions: 530 mm (20,9\") x 145 mm (5,7\") x 200 mm (7.9\") (without lamp)\nColor: White (if the stretch goal is achieved, two additional colors will be unlocked.)\nPlug: Vega will be shipped with plugs for Europe, US, UK and Australia/New Zealand.\nPower: 12V\nLamp: 20 w LED light, 200 ppfd @ 100 mm\nConnectivity: Wi-fi\nUsage: Indoor use only",
      "We have been testing several functioning prototypes over the last year to make sure that it works as intended. Since Vega is the evolution of our first product, we have applied what we have learned from that and improved it.",
      "It is important to us that it does not only work as intended and looks good, but also that the design is user-friendly and intuitive.",
      "Botanium was founded in Stockholm in 2016 by a group of designers and engineers with a passion for creating innovative products that enable everyone to grow their own food without compromising their modern lifestyle. We strive to accelerate and simplify urban gardening, enabling everyone to be a grower.",

No more fears of cyber attacks or missing critical codes. Simplify your life with our gadget and enjoy peace of mind.",
      "Are you tired of the hassle and frustration of keeping track of your PIN codes and passwords? We understand - it's not easy to remember them all, let alone ensure they're all secure. But unfortunately, the risks of cyber attacks and data breaches are very real, and it only takes one weak password to compromise your entire online presence.",
      "That's why we're thrilled to introduce PIN-Master\u00ae - the solution to all your password and PIN code woes. With PIN-Master\u00ae, you can enjoy the peace of mind that comes with knowing your data is secure and accessible when you need it. Say goodbye to the fear of being hacked or forgetting a critical code - PIN-Master\u00ae is completely offline and cannot be hacked.",
      "Say hello to a simpler, safer, and more efficient way of managing your codes and passwords.",
      "PIN-Master\u00ae is 100% Safe and Secure. It is offline and cannot be hacked. Use it for your most critical and important codes. Especially those you would never store on your Mobile, in an App, in the Cloud or in any online Password Manager.",
      "Why do we feel so confident that no one can hack your PIN-Master\u00ae?",
      "We are using an AES encryption. However, the encryption of the data is actually the fourth layer of security as:",
      "1. You MUST first obtain the physical product.",
      "2. You MUST know the Master Key as all data is automatically erased (swiped off) if a wrong Master Code is entered 3 times (software programing). This means 3 attempts out of 100 million different combinations, and it is not possible to let a computer automatically key in all the combinations.",
      "3. The microprocessor LOCK Bits are activated which means no data can be retrieved from the microprocessor.",
      "4. Should someone be able to steal the work tools from the microprocessor manufacturer and break the microprocessor LOCK Bits, then the data is AES encrypted.",
      "This is why PIN-Master\u00ae is the Most Secure & Compact Password Manager in the world.",
      "Either passwords are easy to crack or hard to remember. To avoid hacking you must create stronger passwords which become even more difficult to remember.",
      "PIN-Master\u00ae allows you to create stronger passwords which are available when you need them. This will also give you a greater incentive to create even stronger passwords, and limit a bad habit of re-using old passwords for different services, as you never have to worry about whether you can actually remember your passwords again. This brings Security and Peace of Mind.",
      "PIN-Master\u00ae can store all your codes. You can keep all your codes in one place and have them ready by hand when you need them. PIN-Master\u00ae can store codes which consist of numbers, letters (both CAPITAL and lower cases) and other symbols and special characters, so all sorts of codes can be managed.",
      "One significant issue is password security, with weak passwords being a primary target for cybercriminals. Most hacking related breaches are due to weak or stolen passwords. Reduce the risk of hacking and potential theft of your IT identity by using strong passwords. According to the Verizon 2021 Data Breach Investigations Report, 61% of data breaches in 2020 involved credential data such as passwords.",
      "Cybersecurity is an essential consideration in our digital age, with cybercrime becoming more prevalent every year. According to a report by Cybersecurity Ventures, global cybercrime costs are expected to reach $10.5 trillion annually by 2025. In addition, the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center received over 791,790 complaints of suspected internet crime in 2020, representing an increase of almost 70% from the previous year.",
      "PIN-Master\u00ae addresses this issue by providing a secure and offline way to store and manage passwords.",
      "Today access codes are used everywhere. Whether it is PIN Codes, Passwords, User-ids, Login codes, Passport numbers or Bank accounts. And we are expected to memorize these by heart.",
      "We have deliberately made PIN-Master\u00ae \"crypto friendly\" by accommodating requirements from owners of crypto currencies, who are seeking a secure offline device where private keys and recovery phrases for their hardware wallets can be safely stored.",
      "Do you have codes which really ought not to be stored on your Mobile, in an App, in the Cloud or in any online Password Manager? And are you aware that even the most popular online Passwords Managers have been hacked? That's why we are different, we are 100% offline!",
      "You never have to worry again that your codes are stolen or that you are caught in an unpleasant situation - standing in a long queue and suddenly you cannot remember your PIN Code..... (we have all tried it).",
      "This is really like an insurance policy - you hope you never need it - but if you suddenly do - then you are pleased you signed up for it! Carry PIN-Master\u00ae as your personal security knowing that you will never be caught off guard again. Isn't this worth 20 cents per day? (Retail Price US$79 divided by 365 days - and actually it lasts for years - so the investment is much lower than 5 cents per day!).",
      "PIN-Master\u00ae 2.0 is an upgraded product which was developed after the successful Kickstarter launch of PIN-Master\u00ae 1.0 in March 2020.",
      "Let's have a look at the improvements compared to the first version PIN-Master\u00ae 1.0. There has been a lot:",
      "You only need to remember one Master Code. PIN-Master\u00ae is Safe, Secure and Easy to use.",
      "When you switch on your PIN-Master\u00ae for the very first time, you will be requested to select your own Master Code.  After you have selected you own Master Code, then you can store all your Passwords, PIN Codes or any other information.",

      "1. Potential delays with manufacturer: Depending on the overall demand for this product, if the demand exceeds the total supply that our manufacturers and suppliers can offer, this could cause potential delays in the shipping of components required to assemble these tickers. In this scenario, we will be sure to work vigorously with our manufacturers to increase volume of production and ensure that supply chain is fully operational to meet the demand. Should this problem arise, we will also be transparent and let all our backers know about such problem and keep them fully updated on the situation.",
      "2. Failure to meet expected delivery date: Again, relating to the possibility of demand exceeding supply, given that we are a relatively small team, and the tickers are all hand assembled, we may not have enough labour force to meet the demand. Should we start falling behind schedule, the plan would be to hire even more staff to help assemble, package and ship the tickers as quickly as possible. We could also outsource assembly work to factories in China to speed things up.",

      "We all know how versatile hex-bit screwdrivers can be, but carrying a full-sized tool as part of your everyday carry (EDC)? That\u2019s a hassle no one wants. So, we asked ourselves: Why can\u2019t a screwdriver be both powerful and pocket-friendly?",
      "After 12 months of development, we\u2019re excited to introduce UltraFix\u2014a compact, versatile tool designed to fit right into your pocket while offering all the functionality you need. It\u2019s sleek, unobtrusive, and always ready when you need it, helping you do more while carrying less.",
      "We didn\u2019t just make a tool\u2014we crafted a companion. The UltraFix is designed to feel natural and intuitive in your hand.",
      "Its rounded, ergonomic shape and smooth chamfered edges ensure a comfortable grip, even when you\u2019re applying full force. No discomfort, no strain\u2014just seamless performance.",
      "With Triple drive angle, an easy-to-operate ratchet mechanism, and a large-capacity bit storage, the UltraFix adapts to any repair challenge with ease. Magnetic features ensure smooth operation, while additional functions like a pry bar, nail puller, and glass breaker take versatility to a whole new level.",
      "Designed for your everyday carry, UltraFix includes a lanyard attachment and a sturdy pocket clip, making it effortless to carry and ready for action at a moment\u2019s notice.",
      "Whether you\u2019re handling household repairs, taking on DIY projects, or working on professional tasks, UltraFix keeps up with you every step of the way\u2014delivering confidence, precision, and convenience all in one sleek design.",
      "To us, the most useful tool is always the one that you have with you. That's why the UltraFix matches that of a EDC pocket knife. It's both comfortable to carry and easy to access without getting in the way.",
      "With dimensions of just 13.23 cm long, 3.2 cm wide, and 0.9 cm thick, and weighing only 100g, the UltraFix defies expectations.",
      "Don\u2019t let its petite appearance fool you; this screwdriver brings the strength of a full toolbox right to your palm. It\u2019s perfect for tight spaces or quick fixes, combining size and power in a sleek design.",
      "The UltraFix driver features a full-sized handle and the ability to conveniently store, access, and customize the bits to meet virtually any situation.",
      "Experience innovative craftsmanship with the UltraFix\u2019s ingenious bit storage system, designed to house up to 7 bits securely within the handle.",
      "With powerful magnetic retention, you\u2019ll never have to worry about losing your bits again. The storage compartment is sealed with a rugged cover, shielding your bits from dirt and debris, while providing a satisfying tactile experience every time you reach for your tool.",
      "No odd, half-sized, or proprietary bits here. We understand that everyone has different needs when it comes to daily tasks. So, being able to store and use 7 standard 1/4\" hex bits that you already own allows you to quickly customize the bit bar to your needs.",
      "Why limit yourself to one function? The UltraFix is designed to tackle a variety of tasks, allowing you to drive screws in any direction\u2014be it vertically, horizontally, or at challenging angles. You\u2019ll appreciate the freedom and speed it brings to your work, minimizing the need to switch between tools, thus allowing you to work more efficiently.",
      "Tackle those hard-to-reach screws effortlessly with the built-in extension rod.",

      "Screwdrivers without ratchets require you to continuously reposition your hand, which is both inefficient and time-consuming, especially during repetitive tasks. A ratchet allows you to turn screws without lifting and readjusting your grip. This simple mechanism makes repairs faster and smoother.",
      "However, not all ratchet designs are created equal\u2014many on the market come with significant drawbacks that we set out to solve.",
      "In conventional edc screwdrivers, the ratchet mechanism is embedded into the tool. You turn it one way for forward motion and flip the tool for reverse motion. The problem? This design doesn\u2019t hold the bit securely\u2014you often have to manually press the bit in place, which is both awkward and inefficient.",
      "To improve on this, some ratchets are designed to be detachable and magnetically reversed. While this solves the bit-holding problem, it introduces new issues:",
      "Neither solution truly delivers a seamless experience. That\u2019s where the UltraFix Ratchet comes in.",
      "We completely reimagined the ratchet mechanism to overcome these challenges:\nThe UltraFix features a fully enclosed ratchet mechanism. This ensures durability, eliminates wear and tear issues, and provides a smooth, reliable operation for years to come.",
      "Changing the ratchet direction is as simple as pressing the directional button. No flipping, detaching, or fumbling\u2014just a smooth transition between forward, reverse, and locked positions.",
      "In short, The UltraFix ratchet doesn\u2019t just solve the problems of existing tools\u2014it redefines what a compact, efficient screwdriver can be.",
      "Titanium alloy offers the perfect balance of strength, lightness, and durability, making it the ideal material for high-performance tools like the UltraFix. Resistant to rust, wear, and tear, the UltraFix is designed to handle the demands of daily use while retaining its sleek, polished appearance.

      "Made from durable titanium, the pry bar combines strength with portability. Small enough to carry, powerful enough to deliver.",
      "A window breaker isn\u2019t something you use every day, but when you need it, it\u2019s absolutely essential. By integrating this function into the UltraFix, we ensure it\u2019s always within reach as part of your EDC toolkit. Whether for personal safety or unexpected situations, this tool provides peace of mind wherever you go.",

      "100% biodegradable cellulose/hemp sponge, with a natural dishwashing soap and a sanitizing dryer",
      "Regular kitchen sponges were proven to represent the biggest reservoirs of active bacteria in the whole house. A dishwashing sponge is 200,000 times dirtier than a toilet seat. Researchers found 362 different species of bacteria, located in sponge\u2019s porous structure, with bacterial density of 45 billion per cm2.",
      "Get rid of the nasty kitchen sponges and replace them with a better alternative!",
      "Spongik is zero plastic 3-in-1 dishwashing set. It's smart feature notifies when it is time to replace the sponge, avoiding the bacteria to reach incubation stage in the sponge.",
      "Designed to reduce all the unnecessary dishwashing plastic items,  Spongik is an environmentally friendly and a zero-waste alternative to conventional polyurethane kitchen sponges and plastic dishwashing liquid bottles. The Spongik set includes a versatile sponge dryer and cellulose sponges infused with chemical-free dishwashing soap.  All made from natural and biodegradable materials.",
      "Smart Sponge is infused with chemical-free soap and is designed to last 20 washes. Which is approximately 2-3 weeks depending on the amount of dishwashing. The soap reduces the breeding of bacteria in the sponge and sanitizes it between washes.",
      "Natural soap is tough on grease yet gentle on hands, and the waste water is harmless for the planet and safe for plants, marine and aquatic life. No need for one-time-use plastic bottles with dishwashing liquid.",
      "2-in-1 Smart Sponge is perfect for travelling & camping.",
      "Ergonomic water drop shape perfectly fits in the hand, while the pointy edge is designed to clean hard-to-reach corners of glasses and bowls. The sponge tackles the toughest jobs, yet it is gentle enough not to scratch the dishes and the non-stick layer of the pans and pots.",
      "All Spongik sponges and dryers are made out of natural materials that have unique properties. Cellulose sponge is naturally compressed and expands in contact with water. And Diatomaceous dryer instantly absorbs moisture.",
      "Spongik set is 100% biodegradable. Basic Sponge is made out of 100% cellulose - a natural and sustainable material that biodegrades without any harm to the environment. Pro Sponge is made out of 100% natural cellulose with the scouring pad that is made out of hemp and cotton blend. Smart Sponge is made out of the same materials as Pro Sponge (cellulose + hemp) and it is infused with natural dishwashing soap.",
      "Spongik set includes a dryer, which is made out of diatomite material that instantly absorbs moisture from its surface. Diatomaceous earth is a naturally occurring mineral that is made of microscopic skeletons of algae that have fossilized over millions of years. Diatomaceous earth has versatile benefits and is a widely used in household and hygiene products including toothpastes, skin scrubs, dietary supplements, pet nutrition products, etc.",
      "When the wet sponge is placed on the Spongik dryer, the moisture and bacteria get pulled out from the sponge. Diatomaceous material attracts and binds bacteria, causing it to dry out and die. The remains of moisture rapidly evaporate by being exposed to greater surface area through millions of pores. Quick elimination of moisture helps the dishwashing sponge to dry faster and reduce breeding of the bacteria.",
      "Neutral colors of the dryer complement the kitchen interior and add a designer\u2019s touch. Choose among fire shades for warm woody interior, water blues for a fresh look, air for bright and modern kitchen environment, and earthy grey for any kitchen interior.",
      "Spongik dryer is versatile in its design and could be placed in various ways around the kitchen sink: standing upright or laying horizontally",
      "To help minimize the space in the small kitchens, Spongik could easily fit between the sink and the wall.",
      "There are 46,000 plastic pieces in every square mile of ocean, weighing up to 269,000 tonnes. Every day around 8 million pieces of plastic make their way into our oceans. Only 9% of plastic get recycled.",
      "Plastic pollution from dish-washing sponges is often overlooked. However, it is an issue worth addressing. Disposed just after few weeks of use, kitchen sponges significantly contribute to non-recyclable plastic waste. Made out of 2 polyurethane polymers, conventional dishwashing sponges can\u2019t be recycled, composed or biodegrade. Around 50 billion kitchen sponges are disposed annually, and will remain in the landfills for 52,000 years.",
      "In the process of dish washing, polyurethane sponges releases tiny particles known as microplastics. Some of these particles remain on the dishes, and get ingested together with traces from chemical-based dishwashing liquid soap.",
      "Microplastics are smaller than the width of a human hair, and there is no water filtration system that is effective enough at filtering them out. Microplastics travel down the drain and make their way into the waterways, seas, and oceans. There are estimated 1.4 million trillion microfibers in the oceans. Barely visible to the naked eye, microplastics are swallowed by marine creatures. Scientists have discovered microfibers in 114 types of aquatic species, half of which are consumed by humans.",
      "Let's take care of our health and our planet and reduce the plastic use!",
      "Pre-order Spongik and make a difference!",
      "Being a product designer I've always felt responsible for the items that I design. Throughout my design career I have been mainly focusing on innovation, function, aesthetics, comfort, and user experience. However, once I started living by the sea, sustainability has become a priority in my design process.",
      "When I lived in Cote d'Azur, France I got overwhelmed by the amount of plastic trash that would get washed up on the shores during the winter months. I used to go the sea almost every day for a jog and found myself with the same monolog in my head \"Why is this beautiful beach so dirty? Why do we make so much plastic waste? Will anyone ever clean this beach???\" These negative thoughts didn't let me enjoy my jogs, and they definitely didn't make the beach cleaner. So instead of complaining, I decided to take the initiative and clean up the beach myself. I began to alternate my regular jogging routine with picking up trash, and little by little the beach became cleaner. The most incredible thing happened when I noticed other people starting to pick up plastic trash at the beach as well. This made me realize that if you want to see a change in this world, you need to start with yourself and set an example. Many people also want to live in a clean world, and sometimes a little motivation is all that is needed.",

      "The idea for a biodegradable dish-washing sponge came to me when my mother, who was observing my plastic-free journey, asked me which sponge am I using for washing dishes. At that time I used a regular polyurethane sponge. Immediately I started searching for plastic-free alternatives and purchased a few cellulose sponges. After a more profound research I discovered that almost no dishwashing sponges on the market are 100% biodegradable. The most sustainable sponges have at least 20-30% plastic mixed into the scouring layer, despite \"green\" claims on the packaging.",
      "Seeing this gap on the market, I decided to develop a 100% biodegradable dishwashing sponge with a few unique features.",
      "4 out of 5 people surveyed, said they hate dish-washing sponges and wish there was a better alternative.",
      "When you think of a dish-washing sponge, wouldn't you want it to be different, better?",

      "First phone cover to automatically sanitize your phone with LED lights and has a built in power bank",
      "As research studies have shown, a typical mobile phone can has as many as 25,000 germs per square inch. But whereas we constantly wash or disinfect our hands, we rarely clean our phones. As a result of coming into contact with multiple surfaces, hands, and being left out of the everyday cleaning routine, cellphones are a breeding ground for thousands of sickness-causing germs to flourish.",
      "Cleaning one\u2019s phone with conventional disinfectant is tedious and the jury is still out about whether alcohol-based cleaners are in fact able to destroy 99.99 percent of germs.  The most effective way to kill bacteria and viruses, according to the National Academies, is UVC, which has been shown to quickly inactivate the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. With the current health crisis that we\u2019re facing, not using effective methods of cleaning your phone\u2019s screen can put you at risk of picking up illnesses such as the flu,  the common cold, or even coronavirus.",
      "Every time the cover is closed, it automatically lights up and sanitizes your entire screen. The light can also be manually activated to shine on any surface you wish to sanitize.",
      "With the 4000 mAh external battery, SmartCover is likely to give you enough power to get you through the entire day of phone use, or alternatively it will power the UV-C light for up to a week without a need for charging.",
      "The leather case has been impregnated with special antimicrobial solution to ensure the case stays germ-free.",
      "In order to make SmartCover a desirable item and thus get it to as many people as possible, we have focused on its design, as well.",
      "IPhone: iPhone 12; iPhone 12 Pro; iPhone 12 Pro Max; iPhone 11 ; iPhone 11 Pro;  iPhone 11 Pro Max",
      "Samsung: Galaxy S21 Ultra;  Galaxy S21+;  Galaxy S21; Galaxy Note20",
      "We put a lot of work into making SmartCover a valuable product. Hours of drawing, planning & designing. We are glad that our efforts resulted in what you can see now. SmartCover.",
      "We are working with lighting speed on the second prototype that is now ready! Please mind the the cover will come in your desired color and there will be 12 UV-C-lights that are powerfull enough to sanitize your whole phone screen or other objects you desire.",
      "We achieved a lot already, but there is a bunch of cool things ahead. More updates from product development and pictures of a working prototype are coming soon.",
      "When COVID-19 took over the world, we decided to put our personal endeavors on hold and create products for the new norm. We wanted to help to prevent the spread of Covid-19, thus, the first product, a unique sanitizing wristband spray called The Band was born. We also ensured that it gets to those who need it the most and donated thousands of the wristbands to a charity organisation in China and Northside Charter High School in Brooklyn.",

The countless possible uses of the longtail means that you can run your daily errands more easily and in full comfort \u2013 thanks to the extensive range of accessories.",
      "Thanks to the height-adjustable handlebars and the different seat posts, the bike fits anyone between 150 cm (4,9 feet) and 200 cm (6,5 feet). The VELLO SUB can also easily be adjusted to the perfect riding position (more upright or more sporty riding positions).",
      "VELLO SUB is a safe, stable and easy to manoeuvre bike due to ultrawide 20\u201d Schwalbe tires that keep its centre of gravity low - regardless of whether it is loaded with cargo or passengers. The handlebar on the saddle enables the child to hold on while riding, or to facilitate the lifting of the VELLO SUB.",

We've been working over the years with engineers and designers to make it ready for manufacturing with the care needed to make it the perfect cargo folding e-bike. The process involved drawing, redrawing, modeling, remodeling, building and rebuilding, testing and retesting.",

      "It's time to get your very first meteorite watch | Selten Watch Co.",
      "SELTEN is proud to launch their very first collection of watches on Indiegogo\u2013 SERIES 00 & SERIES 01, a watch that has an unparalleled value for money while having their own unique design.",
      "SELTEN is the German word for \u201crare\u201d\u2014due to our utmost respect for German watchmaking.",
      "We are a contemporary microbrand watch company that opens to different ideas, creative thinking, unique materials, and an overall fresh approach to making timepieces. These watches will capture your attention immediately and refuse to let it go.",
      "SERIES 00.00",
      "A defining feature of SELTEN watches is the use of intriguing materials that offer unique finishes.",
      "Whether Meteorite or Aventurine, the theme that binds these materials together is that the final executions of the same raw material are never exactly the same.",
      "Therefore, every SELTEN watch offers its own distinct design touches and no two watches are identical.",
      "SERIES 01.13",
      "The main difference between SERIES 00 & SERIES 01 is the Day And Night Indicator",
      "Living up to our motto, \u201cA Rare Kind, Not a Stereotype\u201d, each watch that bears the SELTEN name is fundamentally unique.",
      "We source them directly from Meteorite Hunter. Period.",
      "The amazing thing about automatic watches is that they do not require a battery inside the watch in order to work.",
      "Instead of using a battery, our watches have a weighted rotor on the back of the movement that will rotate whenever you\u2019re wearing or shaking the watch.",
      "What this means is that whenever you\u2019re moving about, you\u2019re generating energy to power your watch \u2013 how cool is that?",
      "We offer 4 colors for our meteorite dials.",
      "The pattern of the meteorite dial is first brought out by etching it in the acid bath, and we rinse it with alcohol to remove any water residue on it, and in this stage, the dial is in Natural color.",
      "For the Natural color dial, it will be coated with a transparent protective layer to isolate it from moisture. While the Anthracite, Black, and Midnight Blue colors are achieved by ion-plating which is the same method done by the other microbrand watches.",
      "In the watch world, a lot of intriguing substances are used for dial making.",
      "Aventurine is a part of the quartz family. It is translucent in appearance but is most known for its many mineral inclusions that give the material a shimmering effect.",
      "The Aventurine we use here is the Dark Blue Aventurine which is a rather uncommon color among its type.",
      "Typically, when you search for an Aventurine watch, you'd probably see that the Aventurine is in a rather Blue-ish color. However, we prefer a more subtle one, so we spent a lot of time searching for a supplier who does this Dark Blue Aventurine.",
      "Aventurine on a dial does a wonderful imitation of a starry sky. The flashes of light bouncing off spangles that appear to be floating inside the dial.",
      "Combining with our watches, like the night sky, Dark Blue Aventurine bears a subtle twinkling, attracting us to seek poetic ways to read the time.",
      "There is the option of the traditional Pontife style hands, characterised by large circular accents, in heated blue steel.",
      "An increasing number of watch brands choose to chemically treat watch hands to achieve a blue colour. The outcome is a homogeneous shade of blue which is devoid of any personality.",
      "In line with our \u201cA Rare Kind, Not a Stereotype\u201d philosophy, we thermally blue watch hands by hand, carefully subjecting the steel to high temperatures to achieve the most exquisite blue tone.",
      "Thermal bluing requires a deft hand and is time-consuming, but the result is that each watch hand is bestowed with its own unique shade, featuring a fusion of blue and purple hues.",
      "We offer two types of colorway for our heated blue steel hands.",
      "The option is based on its legibility.",
      "Type I is with the Blue Hour & Min Hand and Silver Second Hand.",
      "Type II is with the Silver Hour & Min Hand and Blue Second Hand.",
      "Lance Hands is available for all dial options.",
      "Alternatively, there is the choice of the sleek Lance style hands coated with Swiss Super-Luminova for optimal legibility in low light.",
      "Our Lance Hands option has equipped with Swiss Super-LumiNova BGW9 on it and also we\u2019ve added Super-LumiNova C3 in our black pigment to make the index glow.",
      "*Lume only applies for Lance Hands",
      "SERIES 00 utilise two meteorite slices on the Day & Night Indicator.",
      "A pair of meteorite slices are used on the SERIES 00 watches for the Day & Night (also known as A.M./P.M. display) indicator.",
      "They are placed inside the subsidiary dial at 6 o\u2019clock where a bright-coloured piece of meteorite represents day and a darker-coloured piece of meteorite represents night.",
      "Due to the nature of the Widmanst\u00e4tten pattern, no meteorites are the same. Therefore each subsidiary dial of a SERIES 00 watch will stand out by having different meteorite finishes.",
      "SERIES 00 & SERIES 01 both come with custom rotors.",
      "SERIES 00",
      "SERIES 01",
      "Every movement sourced for SELTEN watches is fitted with a custom rotor, which is visible through the watches\u2019 exhibition casebacks.",
      "The design of our custom rotor is based on the Triple Horn of Odin emblem from Norse mythology.",
      "Double Finish",
      "In all its versions, SERIES 00 & SERIES 01 radiates its status as an art.",
      "Our watch is done with contrasting finishes to give the watch an interesting and sophisticated look and create extra depth to the look of the watch from many angles.",
      "Our buckle also features a double finish, a polished finish on the top, and a brushed finish on the side.",

      "If you wish to reserve your preferred number,  you can select the customised serial number service in the add-on section.",
      "The first 1000 pieces of each SERIES will be individually numbered.",
      "Sapphire crystal rates a full 9 on the Mohs scale. The Mohs scale is used to measure the relative mineral hardness of materials, with diamond being a 10 on the Mohs scale as one of the hardest materials. This is why we chose this for both SERIES 00 & SERIES 01.",
      "Our sapphire crystal has also applied 5 layers of Anti-Reflective Coating on the underside to improve legibility.",
      "Double lug holes have been retained to accommodate both straight and curved straps.",
      "We are proud to announce our collaboration with HAS NO BOUNDS, a newly established brand, who focuses on premium handcrafted leather goods. They will be crafting the leather straps for SELTEN watches!",
      "Apparently, HAS NO BOUNDS shares the same vision with us of creating unique products with unparalleled value for money.",
      "Every watch will come with a leather strap as the default option.",
      "We\u2019ve specially chosen these luxury Italian leather for our watches.",
      "Museum Calf is made famous by John Lobb Pairs for their luxury leather shoes. Each leather hide is hand-dyed featuring a glossy sheen with a unique marble-like effect.",
      "Maine Liscio is a pure vegetable tanned leather in aniline-dyed, featuring a natural surface with a pleasant hand touch. Over wear, it will become silky smooth and age beautifully.",
      "Our straps come with the Quick Release Spring Bar which allows you to switch straps easily.",
      "Our butterfly deployant clasp bracelet is made of 316L Stainless Steel.",
      "Our bracelets are with solid end links that fit the wrist better and are more comfortable than hollow end links. It comes with screw-in links which makes it the simplest bracelet to resize. It\u2019s also very reliable.",
      "The butterfly deployant clasp is completely invisible when you\u2019re wearing the watch. It makes the band look seamless like the watch is magically staying buckled without the clasp. It\u2019s perhaps the most elegant type of watch clasp that you will encounter.",
      "The bracelet is tapered to 16mm.",
      "It is for those looking for a secure and inconspicuous type of clasp \u2013 it closes on the wrist, so the mechanism will not be seen on the outer strap.",
      "It also equips with Quick Release Mechanism to allow you to change it to leather strap in a flash.",
      "We also offer an extra 1.25x link for the micro adjustment needs.",
      "Our first collection offers two different models, the SERIES 00 and the SERIES 01, each with its own signature dial layout.",
      "SERIES 00 includes a subsidiary dial at 6 o\u2019clock, complete with a pair of meteorite discs to indicate day and night.",
      "On the other hand, the absence of the subdial on SERIES 01 allows the striking Meteorite/Aventurine Dial to take center stage.",
      "Each watch will come with a handcrafted leather strap made by HAS NO BOUNDS.",

If you\u2019re new to the name, get ready for timepieces that are truly unique. They\u2019re built to the highest standards and feature designs that captivate the imagination and maintain spectacular levels of accuracy.",
      "While traditional watch brands are often confined to one location and thus rooted in one particular way of thinking, as a modern watch brand, we have the privilege of looking to all corners of the globe for inspiration.",

We design and handcraft every piece in our atelier, combining minimal lines with deep-black aesthetics. Two collections: one ready-to-wear, one avant-garde and made-to-measure. All made within a slow-fashion process. 80% of our fabrics are certified OEKO-TEX\u00ae, like bamboo, organic cotton, and wool. Every single piece is designed, cut, and sewn by us at our atelier, so 100% made in Italy.",
      "Our high-quality standards have led us to be selected among ten emerging designers in Italy to participate in Seoul Fashion Week.",

Ando stitched the first pieces in her grandma\u2019s house, while Savio supported from afar, working odd jobs. Tired of our journey, we took a one-way flight to Berlin on September 15th, 2015. It changed our lives forever.",
      "We landed in Berlin with around \u20ac3,000 (our parents\u2019 savings) and a month in an Airbnb. We moved into a shared house with 9 housemates (33 different ones in 3 years). That tiny 20 sqm room became our first studio. Sewing machine on the desk. Fabrics under the couch. A fold-out table on the bed.",
      "Savio landed his first job as an Art Director, and we slowly invested in our brand. We placed our first pieces in Berlin\u2019s top concept stores: LNFA, Studio183, and Syld.",

      "We\u2019ve always believed in craftsmanship, creativity, and quality \u2013 never chasing mass-market shortcuts. That meant turning down lucrative offers that didn\u2019t feel right. We've built everything with our own hands and the money earned from side jobs: waitress, costume designer, art director, packaging assistant, social media manager, newspaper delivery\u2026",
      "Every euro we made through the brand went back into fabrics, machines, studio rent, and production. From bedrooms to basements to co-working spaces, the journey\u2019s been wild. And just when things started to take off \u2013 COVID hit. But it also gave us the push to come home.",
      "After seven years, we left Berlin, our apartments, our friends (Bebo, Carlos, Marike, Emilie, Alessandra) and opened our first physical atelier in Bari, Italy \u2013 Savio\u2019s hometown. We used our savings to transform a small space downtown into something raw, magical, and unmistakably ours.",

That\u2019s why I created Memory Vault \u2014 a holiday ornament that\u2019s also a USB time capsule. It\u2019s a beautiful way to store your favorite photos, videos, and memories \u2014 and hang them on the tree year after year.",
      "This campaign helps bring Memory Vault to life just in time for the 2025 holiday season. With your support, we\u2019ll start shipping in October so families everywhere can unwrap not just another ornament \u2014 but a moment that matters.",
      "What We Need & What You Get",
      "We\u2019re raising $15,000 to help fund our first production run of Memory Vault ornaments, custom retail packaging, and fulfillment prep for holiday delivery.",

      "Risks & Challenges",
      "The biggest challenge is timing. Since we\u2019re producing a seasonal product for this line, October delivery is critical. Fortunately, we\u2019ve already sourced our production and fulfillment partners, and we\u2019re only moving forward now that we know we're ready.",

      "The PIXL\u2122 community is growing every single day, and you can help grow it even more! Hit one of the buttons below and tag a friend or coworker who would build something #PIXLperfect with PIXL\u2122.",
      "It\u2019s as simple as it looks. Start with one PIXL\u2122 block (patents pending), then place another PIXL\u2122 block next to it. You\u2019ll immediately feel them click together. No interlocking knobs, grooves, or specific sides to line up - it\u2019s really that easy.",
      "From there, it\u2019s up to you. Do you want to build up? Sideways? In all directions? We\u2019d prefer to not tell you how to play. You do your thing.",
      "Thanks to the help of rare-earth magnets that are contained in PIXL\u2122, connecting PIXL\u2122 blocks is simple.",
      "Once connected, you can choose to line up the PIXL\u2122 blocks to be perfectly flush with each other, or you can choose to add some dimension to your model by rotating/shifting the blocks to result in more depth.",
      "On that note, can we point out that we put a ridiculous amount of time into dialing in the right magnetic strength? Too much attraction, and it interfered with building structures. Too little, and 3D structures began to feel a little flimsy.",
      "We should also mention that we designed PIXL\u2122 to not just be magnetic, but to be self-correcting/auto-polarizing. What does that mean? Basically, you can place any PIXL\u2122 block next to another PIXL\u2122 block and it will be attracted to it, correcting the polarity as needed.",
      "Speaking of spending time agonizing over design details to make PIXL\u2122 just right, we also carefully deliberated over what we felt would be the perfect sizes for PIXL\u2122. What we came up with was the following:",
      "It\u2019s fairly self-explanatory, but if you didn't catch it - each 2-block is the same size as two 1-blocks lined up next to each other, and so on.",
      "Inventor\u2019s note: we prefer to use all sizes for 3D models, while using only 1-blocks for 2D models (as we love the visual effect this results in), but you can mix it up and build in whatever way you choose!",
      "For a visual breakdown of how many blocks of each size are included for the 3 packs available as rewards, please see below:",
      "Please note: PIXL Packs come in whatever specific size of block and color you choose, whereas PIXL Starter Packs and PIXL Builder Packs come in a variety of shades of whatever \u201ccore\u201d color you choose (13 total options).",
      "We're optimistic about the number of applications that the PIXL\u2122 community will find for PIXL\u2122. We could talk all day about how we love to play with PIXL\u2122, but the real testament will be once we get this out into the world and see how individuals are using it creatively in their workplaces or simply their everyday hobbies and lives at home.",
      "Almost anything you can think up. Start small, but dream big. How about a cute jumping spider, a rocket ship, an apple tree, a creative remix of your favorite family picture, a cozy log cabin?",
      "We designed PIXL\u2122 to be an infinitely expandable building system. In other words, there\u2019s practically no size limit when it comes to what you want to create.",
      "Of course, you\u2019ll play around with how many PIXL\u2122 blocks can be supported magnetically in any particular direction, but we think that\u2019s part of the fun of building. Hint: if your design involves really large overhangs, try getting even more creative by building supporting structures beneath it!",
      "Check out some of the designs we put together while playing with PIXL\u2122:",
      "As we\u2019ve played with PIXL\u2122 throughout the process of developing it, we\u2019ve gravitated toward our preferred styles of building. What we really want to know is this: what do you want to build with PIXL\u2122? We\u2019d love to hear what ideas you have brewing...",
      "We believe in playing. And we think everyone has a creative side, whether or not they\u2019d traditionally consider themselves a \"creative person\". What we hope to do is provide the world with a tool in PIXL\u2122 that unleashes that creativity.",
      "One of our favorite things about PIXL\u2122 is that there are just no rules. So whether you\u2019re the type of person who enjoys puzzles (we affectionately refer to 2D PIXL\u2122 builds as next-gen puzzles), someone who enjoys making things with their hands, or perhaps don\u2019t even find yourself fitting into any of the aforementioned descriptions, we think you\u2019ll be surprised by just how addictive PIXL\u2122 is to use.",
      "PIXL\u2122 is available in 52 different colors.",
      "You may feel overwhelmed by the abundance of choices - but there\u2019s no time for that, you\u2019ve got masterpieces to make! We\u2019ve made it easy to understand the palette by breaking down these 52 colors into 13 packs: White, Black, Grey, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Pink, Beige, Brown, and Rainbow.",

      "Though PIXL\u2122 is self-correcting/auto-polarizing, sometimes you may want to override the magnetic alignment between multiple PIXL\u2122 as you're building. We\u2019ve got you covered.",
      "PIXL Wand\u2122 uses a fixed polarity design, meaning the super strong magnets in each end will essentially force the polarity of an individual PIXL\u2122 block to be aligned in a particular direction when the PIXL Wand\u2122 is brought in contact with the block.",
      "This can be particularly helpful if a block or collection of blocks is being unusually stubborn in its alignment. Hint: PIXL Wand\u2122 is a tool that is situational, as using it too liberally may end up pulling apart your model.",
      "Please note that PIXL Wand\u2122 will be available for purchase after the project comes to a close.",
      "While prototyping PIXL\u2122, one of our favorite things to do was to share with each other the designs we had each come up with. We knew this process of sharing ideas and sparking inspiration had to become a central part to the PIXL\u2122 ecosystem.",
      "That\u2019s why we developed the PIXL Companion App\u2122.",
      "With the PIXL Companion App\u2122, you can map out your designs in a 2D or 3D environment before building them in real life (or perhaps digitize a design in the app once you\u2019ve already built it in real life). Then, using the Discover gallery, share your designs with the rest of the PIXL\u2122 community and see what other users are building, too!",
      "Have a picture or favorite piece of art you want to remix in 2D with PIXL\u2122? Simply upload it to the app, which will convert it into an easy-to-follow blueprint, made out of the exact colors from the PIXL\u2122 Palette. You can choose what \u201cresolution\u201d you want the blueprints to be shown in, meaning you can convert the image to be buildable on a 7x7 PIXL Canvas\u2122 all the way up to a 63x63 PIXL Canvas\u2122.",
      "The PIXL Companion App\u2122 will be available for download upon shipping, in the Apple App Store, Google Play, as well as in a web-based application.  We\u2019re also playing around with the idea of a closed-beta, available exclusively to PIXL\u2122 backers. Stay tuned...",
      "PIXL\u2122 is available at launch in three different pack sizes: PIXL Starter Packs\u2122, PIXL Builder Packs\u2122, and PIXL Packs\u2122.",

      "For, well, getting started.",
      "We designed the PIXL Starter Pack\u2122 as a great way to get your feet wet with PIXL\u2122. This is a perfect collection of PIXL\u2122 blocks to allow you to make models on the \u201clower resolution\u201d end of the scale. Don\u2019t be fooled by the \u201cStarter\u201d prefix, though - this collection is seriously versatile and a ton of fun.",
      "PIXL Builder Packs\u2122",
      "For when you\u2019re serious about growing your PIXL\u2122 toolbox.",
      "We put together the PIXL Builder Pack\u2122 for those of you who have big ideas.",
      "PIXL Packs\u2122",
      "For when you want to add to your palette with specific colors in specific sizes of PIXL\u2122. (In other words, each PIXL Pack\u2122 includes multiple PIXL\u2122 blocks of one specific color and size).",
      "Need a handful of 3-blocks in the lightest shade of Blue? No problem. How about a collection of 6-blocks in the darkest shade of Pink that we offer? You got it.",

      "It is an absolute obsession of ours to see an idea evolve from an intangible state all the way through to launch, and we couldn\u2019t be more excited to be sharing our latest passion project, PIXL\u2122, with you here.",
      "We\u2019re glad you asked. PIXL\u2122 is ready to hit the big-time: mass production.",
      "Tooling is already underway (we\u2019re ready to scale this tooling appropriately as the project progresses), packaging has been designed, and all we\u2019re waiting for is\u2026 you.",
      "We\u2019ve been hard at work on PIXL\u2122 over the last two years. In fact, PIXL\u2122 has its origin in a time prior to us launching Fidget Cube.",
      "Though we\u2019ve probably made it pretty clear in our words above, we\u2019ll say it again here: the version of PIXL\u2122 you\u2019re seeing today is the culmination of a ridiculous amount of time spent sketching, CAD modeling, 3D printing, building with prototypes, tooling, refining (and repeating this process over and over again).",
      "We can\u2019t wait for you to get your hands on PIXL\u2122.",
      "We seriously can\u2019t do this without you. So if you\u2019re digging PIXL\u2122, please don\u2019t hesitate to share it with your friends. We\u2019ve made it really simple. Just hit one of the buttons below (or at the top of the page).",

      "On that note, we\u2019d also like to mention that this project is proudly supported by HoneyBrandger\u2122, a passion project of ours that was born out of the many lessons learned over our five previous Kickstarter campaigns. HoneyBrandger\u2122 is a team of awesome people - or HoneyBrandgers - that are super knowledgeable about Kickstarter, Indiegogo, and PIXL\u2122, and are ready to help answer any questions you may have! If you\u2019re reaching out to us, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll be getting a friendly response from a HoneyBrandger\u2122 on our team. So be nice! (They won\u2019t bite... promise).",
      "International Backers.",
      "This project isn't just for backers in the United States. We'll be shipping PIXL\u2122 worldwide!",
      "That being said, there are unique processes that apply specifically to international backers that we'd like you to be aware of. Please note that there is no way for us to charge any additional amount on our end for any applicable VAT/duties that may be a result of a specific country's local tax code. Therefore, these fees may be incurred upon receipt of your reward. These fees are the responsibility of each backer, and additional information regarding VAT/duties can be found in our FAQ below.",
      "We also want to bring attention to the fact that some international locations routinely experience higher rates of lost or stolen packages. If this applies to where you live, please be aware of this and take this risk into account when you pledge.",
      "In addition, due to first class shipping fees and the dimensions of PIXL\u2122, shipping rates may seem a bit high for some international locations. Not to worry though, our awesome shipping partners at Shipwire have ensured us that the current rates we\u2019ve been given for international shipments are the absolute lowest available while still resulting in a timely delivery.",
      "Some final thoughts.",
      "PLEASE NOTE: PIXL\u2122 is a toy for adults (18+) only.",
      "PIXL\u2122 is not a children's toy, and should not be used by individuals under the age of 18. We are not marketing PIXL\u2122 to any individual under the age of 18, and PIXL\u2122 should not be given to individuals under the age of 18. If you have children under the age of 18 in your home, please be mindful to keep PIXL\u2122 entirely out of their reach.",
      "We are also exploring the potential of adding a non-toxic bittering agent to the outside of each PIXL block, but we are still working to assess the viability of this process. For a full list of warnings and precautions, please click here.",
      "Finally, as is standard with crowdfunding projects, PIXL\u2122 is in the final stages of development and therefore the prototype product displayed in images and videos shown in this project page (including those displaying software) is subject to change in the final production version.",

      "Gr5 Titanium|A Dual-Scale Ruler| A Protractor|A Mini Craft Knife,Ti Foldable Ruler.",
      "Hey there, adventurers of creativity and precision!",
      "I'm excited to introduce you to the Prule \u2013 a truly revolutionary titanium folding ruler that brings together practicality, adaptability, and functionality in a way you've never seen before. It's not just a ruler; it's a game-changer.",
      "Made from Gr5 titanium, Prule is a tough little ruler that's built to last. It folds up magnetically, making it super easy to carry around with you. Despite its compact size, Prule is incredibly strong and durable, making it perfect for a wide range of tasks. Also, the Prule has made significant improvements in its ergonomic design.",
      "But here's the real kicker: a built-in protractor for measuring angles and a tiny craft knife for quick cuts or trimming. Of course, the Prule packed with more features that make it even more versatile. Whether you're working on a DIY project, doing some crafting, or just need a reliable ruler for everyday tasks, the Prule has everything you need in one sleek, ergonomic design.",
      "So why settle for an ordinary ruler when you can have the Prule? It's the perfect addition to your toolkit, ready to tackle any task you throw at it. It's tailor-made for DIY enthusiasts, crafters, students, architects, engineers, and for anyone who values accuracy and comfort.",
      "The Prule is crafted with a 25\u00b0 angled surface that naturally aligns with your line of sight. This means you can read the measurements without straining your neck or back, making reading measurements a joy, not a chore.",
      "Comfort to read",
      "With its unique thickened design, the Prule is not only easier to grip, but also ensures safer cutting by keeping hands away from the path of the blade, providing a more stable and safe measurement state.",
      "easy to grab",
      "safe to cut",
      "Alright, let's talk about the material now. The Prule is made from Gr5 titanium, which is super strong and lightweight, perfect for high-performance tasks. Its incredible strength ensures it won't break easily, giving you peace of mind. Despite being tough, it's so light you'll barely feel it in your pocket, and it looks awesome too. The titanium body makes it durable and versatile, performing flawlessly in any environment. Built to last, the Prule withstands the toughest conditions without compromising performance, making it your perfect go-to tool.",
      "Imagine a ruler where every mark is as crisp as a freshly pressed button. Our laser-etched scales provide unparalleled clarity, ensuring you never miss a millimeter or a sixteenth of an inch. Whether you\u2019re working in imperial or metric, the scales are meticulously engraved to provide accurate and easy-to-read measurements.",
      "Tired of guesswork when measuring from a non-zero starting point? Our ruler starts its scales at zero, providing an intuitive and straightforward measuring experience. No more subtracting or estimating \u2013 just clear, accurate measurements every time.",
      "Meet the ruler that adapts to your needs. Its design allows for both deep and shallow measurements, making it perfect for a wide range of tasks. Whether you're measuring the depth of a wide, deep container or the narrow confines of a tiny bottle, this ruler is your versatile, reliable companion.",
      "The Prule cleverly turns its folding design into a super-versatile protractor that both pros and hobbyists will love. We've really put some thought into the ruler's hinge, making it double as a protractor that smoothly opens up to 180 degrees. With this innovative design, you can measure any angle in a breeze, just by using the ruler's natural motion.",
      "Inside this range, we've thoughtfully added six different detent spots, each marked every 30 degrees. These spots give you a nice clicky feeling when you hit them, helping you set common angles quickly and accurately. Whether you're sketching cool designs, planning out buildings, or doing detailed engineering work, the Prule is incredibly handy. You can easily lock into the angle you need, making your measurements and drawings both precise and quick.",
      "But The Prule doesn't just measure \u2013 it cuts too! Our ruler is equipped with a hidden blade that's perfect for a wide range of cutting tasks.",
      "Attach a rope or lanyard to the convenient hole, making it easy to keep The Prule with you wherever you go.",
      "A ceramic bead breaker is included for emergencies, and the tritium slot allows you to insert a tritium or glow tube, making Prule glow in the dark for easy location. In emergency situations, the ceramic bead can be used to break windows, providing a vital escape route.",
      "Equipped with 2 tritium slots on each side, you can insert 1.5*6mm tritium tubes or glow-in-the-dark tubes for easy location in dim environments. This feature ensures that The Prule is always within reach when you need it most.",
      "To express our heartfelt gratitude to our esteemed early backers, we are delighted to introduce exclusive reward tiers exclusively for you. Each reward package includes an Prule Ruler, 10 replacement blades, and complimentary worldwide shipping, ensuring no additional charges beyond your pledged amount. If you find our add-on options appealing, you have the option to select them through our supplementary offerings.",
      "The sooner you decide to back our project, the more generous the discount you will receive. Therefore, we highly encourage you to pledge at your earliest convenience to secure the most favorable pricing!",
      "If you\u2019re looking to further personalize your Prule, explore our add-on options, which include items like a carrying pouch, titanium lanyard bead, replacement blades, tritium vials, glass luminous vials, or engraving services. This flexibility allows you to customize your reward to fit your style and preferences.",
      "P.S.: Tritium vials provide a continuous glow without needing a charge, while glass luminous vials require exposure to light to illuminate.",
      "The journey of the Prule, from initial concept to prototype, and now to a final product, has taken us over half a year of hard work and dedication. If the product is well-received and supported by everyone, it will take a few more months from production to shipping before it reaches your hands. We are aiming to start shipping by the end of March, and while we will do our best to deliver earlier without compromising on quality, we will also keep you updated throughout the entire process.",
      "Of course, the design process of The Prule was not without its challenges. Initially, our goal was simple: to create a folding ruler. But how could we make it more innovative and unique? We pondered over this question and came up with an idea \u2013 using the folding mechanism to create a simple yet precise protractor. By simply adding scales and gears to the ruler, when the concept became true, we thought, \"Bang, it worked!\"",
      "Here is the initial sketch of the Prule:",
      "With a clear vision in mind, we moved into the design phase. We sketched numerous concepts, refined them through CAD modeling, and focused on integrating the folding mechanism with the protractor function. Titanium alloy was chosen for its lightweight strength and corrosion resistance, ensuring that the ruler could withstand the rigors of professional use while maintaining a sleek and elegant appearance.",
      "With the help of 3D printing technology, we created multiple prototypes for physical testing and functional verification. User feedback was invaluable, guiding us to make further improvements. We iterated on the design, optimizing ergonomics, aesthetics, and the overall user experience.",
      "3D printing",
      "3D printed product",
      "Eventually, after numerous rounds of testing and refinement, we successfully crafted a final prototype that embodied our vision. The Prule Titanium Multi-Functional Folding Ruler not only folded for easy storage but also featured a precision protractor with scales and gears, making it a versatile tool for professionals across various fields.",
      "Prototype",
      "Prule is a multifaceted tool designed to revolutionize your measuring, cutting, and problem-solving abilities, serving as your trusted sidekick in life's challenges. Join us in supporting this vision, and together we can bring Prule to life, transforming the world of measuring with this precision tool that's truly a cut above the rest.

      "Our story begins with a harrowing experience on a very cold European beach in 2019. While enjoying the sunset with friends on what was meant to be a quick stop, disaster struck as our car got stuck in the sand. With virtually no phone battery or charging cables, we were left stranded in the dark - a blizzard complicating the desperate situation.",
      "It was an experience that no one should ever have to endure - and this very experience spurred us into action. Back in Miami, we embarked on a mission to develop the world\u2019s fastest portable power bank and BOLD was born in mid 2021.",
      "In the last 2 years, we thought about other cool \u2018uze\u2019 cases for a power bank. We are avid travellers, so owning a jacket is a must \u2013 however, being from a tropical climate we hardly utilise warm garments in our everyday routine. Buying multiple jackets fitting different occasions, seemed wasteful so we explored the idea of a 4-season jacket. After testing heated jackets available in the market, we quickly realized that they are not heating up properly, with the main culprits being the use of cheap heat pads and basic power banks. With our know-how in power banks and graphene technology, we married the most versatile jacket ever with state-of-the-art heat pads and power bank.",
      "Our journey has been one of dedication, determination, innovation and lengthy testing. We pour our own experiences and lessons into each UZE product, ensuring that they deliver beyond our competition. Our innovative range of products is a testament to our unwavering commitment to excellence, and we're excited to present them to the world. After years of research and development, we proudly present the UZE Heated Jacket. We're excited to see Heated Jacket in the hands of people who share our passion for innovative and savvy technology to make their lives better.",
      "The UZE Heated Jacket is the epitome of modularity, versatility and durability, eliminating the need to purchase multiple jackets per year, combining cutting-edge graphene heating technology, fast-charging capabilities, and unparalleled water resistance.",

My site will simplify that for everyone and allow them a way to get whatever the outdoors need is filled with no stress, no drama, and no long lines at that ridiculous self-checkout that so many people are switching to.",

Preventing serious medical and cosmetic problems for your pet is now simple, affordable and painless. At present, there is no established market leader for a brush of this kind and many pet owners have been left wondering if there really is a better solution for dealing with severe periodontal problems than what has traditionally been made available.

      "In today\u2019s fast-moving, high tech world, 3D printers are crucial for the development of designers, engineers, entrepreneurs and a new generation of young people. So we concentrated on ease of use, reliability and performance in the creation of Rose Go.",
      "Rose Go is the culmination of our long-term research and development work. It combines both aesthetic design and engineering performance along with user-friendly features. It looks great, works great, and delivers affordable 3D printing performance for everyone.",
      "High quality motors result in high quality prints. A big problem for many printers is ripples after corners and having finer resolution steppers helps reduce that. Instead of a standard 1.8\u00b0 stepper motor, Rose Go uses a 0.9\u00b0 motor with twice the precision. This significantly improves fineness and accuracy.",
      "One of the most common complaints about 3D printers is the loud noise that they make during printing. Rose Go has come up with an ingenious silent drive solution. Our StealthChop2 ultra-quiet technology can keep the motor sound under 10dB, much lower than typical printers.",
      "Rose Go adopts the platform scheme of PEI+ steel plate. The detachable steel plate platform makes it easy for users to detach the model. PEI (Polyetherimide) has excellent high-temperature stability and can be used under -160\u00b0 to 180\u00b0 operating temperatures for a long time. Compared with the normal frosted bed surface, PEI material provides a better underside effect. It can make sure the bottom surface of the model is smooth enough and makes the stripping of the model easier than ever.",
      "Rose Go uses the most advanced 16-point leveling algorithm. The induction sensor in the automatic leveling machine detects the distance between the print head and the bed. Leveling is easier than ever, making print set up fast and simply for beginners.",
      "For most 3D printers, the accidental disconnection of material often results in failed prints. However, with Rose Go, you don't need to worry about this. The printer includes a system to detect run out filament that constantly monitors the material and avoid such errors.",
      "Rose Go is plug & play and can be set up in minutes. It is designed to be easy enough that even beginners can quickly get started and begin their creations in 3D. The screen allows the user to pause and save during the print process. Real-time adjustment of printing speed, printing nozzle temperature for better printing tasks.",
      "Rose Go includes its own easy to use software - Rose3D. To begin your creation you simply drag and drop a print file onto Rose3D to preview the Gcode. The printer is also compatible with other popular slicer software if you prefer, such as CURA or Simplify 3D.",
      "Reliability is the issue that people care about the most. So we put a lot of effort into that. For the main structure of the equipment, we use the aluminum-plastic composite plate, which is composed of two aluminum sheets sandwiched by polyethylene. After the assembly, we used three integral injection parts to form the body resulting in excellent overall stability and stable, reliable printing.",
      "We asked ourselves the question\u2026\u201d what makes a good 3D printer?\u201d We know from years of experience using various printers on the market that low cost and high quality are difficult to achieve simultaneously. Low cost printers require higher maintenance and lack durability while higher quality printers cost more and are more difficult to learn to use.",
      "Our summation of the perfect combination for a high value 3D printer is\u2026",
      "\"Engineering performance + Aesthetics design + Ease of use\"",
      "A good 3d printer has to perform with a high level of detail and quality, have features that are the most essential to users, and have a unique and pleasing aesthetic design that makes it intuitive and easy to use for better user experience.",
      "For the main structure of the equipment, we use the aluminum-plastic composite plate, which is composed of two aluminum sheets sandwiched by acrylic. The material is easy to manufacture even if it meets the requirements of structural engineering. After the assembly, we used three integral injection parts to package, and the whole after the transfer was loaded tightly for the second time. Get the overall stability, output stable printing effect.",

      "Cyclists can't escape darkness: It returns every evening and sometimes even at daytime when passing tunnels. Battery lights seem comfortable with quick & easy installation but there will be moments when the batteries are empty while you need them most.\nWith Magnic Microlights you don't have to fear these moments because you have neverending light :\n\nBenefits of Magnic Microlights:",
      "Don't mix Magnic Microlights with other bicycle lights: NO SPOKE MAGNETS have to be attached for Magnic Microlights, Wega & Magnic Lights!",
      "Magnic Microlights are the world\u2019s smallest non-contact dynamos, that are integrated together with electronics and lighting system in the brake shoes. In 2012 we presented our invention Magnic Light on Kickstarter. Many \"experts\" did not believe this principle can work and believed our lights would be a fake but the MAGIC is clever usage of well known eddy current technology. With more than 17.000 Magnic lights on the road via our successful Magnic Light IC campaign 2014 and our webshop we have proved that this sustainable, environment-friendly technology has the power to replace battery lights for bicycles.",
      "The last 18 months we worked hard on the development of the Micro-Technology. With Magnic Microlights you can add non-contact dynamo light to your bicycle without need of extra adapters. If your bicycle has disc brakes choose Wega which has flexibility in four directions and fits to nearly all other bikes (except Vbrake/Canti systems), too.",
      "HOW CAN THESE TINY LIGHTS BE STRONG?",
      "Beneath generator technology one important aspect is the optimal choice of LED + lens which gives a big advantage compared to normal LED bicycle lights. For the Magnic Microlights we have chosen the newest extreme density - Cree LED (available since summer 2018): The most efficient high power LED with minimum size (1.6 mm x 1.6mm compared to 3.45mm x 3.45mm as used in many LED biycle lights).",
      "What does this mean for Magnic Microlights? \n\nImagine you have a good bicycle light with 3,45mm x 3,45 mm LED, Lens of size 34,5 mm and 100 Lumen/Watt (These are quite excellent values for biycle lights).",
      "Magnic Microlights don't have the strongest generators (because cyclists should not feel anything!) but they have the best light efficiency on the market: 200 Lumen/Watt !",
      "See the specification here and preorder on the top right of this page.\n\nFor all Microlights we offer a Roadbike/ Caliper, a Vbrake and a Cantilever version:",
      "We have tested the current brakeshoe design from May to October, 2018 on roadbikes & mountainbikes with more than 3000 test kilometers. Although the stability of the prototype material (3d printed PLA) did not match that of the final product, there was no  difference in braking performance compared to standard brakes that we otherwise use in training and everyday cycling.",
      "TECHNICAL DATA",
      "Our prototypes are less efficient than the final version because of lower generator power. We have to estimate the power of the final product based on the prototypes and our experience from the current Magnic Light version.",
      "BRAKE LIGHT",
      "Magnic Microlights have an effective brake light function. When you pull the brakes the distance between rim and generator decreases resulting in higher generator power and higher light output. The brake light works precisely and is a clear signal for subsequent traffic.",
      "All Magnic Microlights have an integrated \"Brake Light\"-function shown here: When you pull the brakes the lights brighten up which warns the driver behind you.",
      "BEAM ADJUSTMENT",
      "The design of front-& rearlight allows to adjust the light beam regardless of the fork angle. Even for extreme bicycle frame geometry you can adjust the light beam towards the road.",
      "BRAKE RUBBER REPLACEMENT",
      "Worn brake pads can be exchanged easily as you would expect from standard brakes.",
      "SHIFT MECHANISM",
      "After longer usage your brakepads will loose up to 5mm material before you have to exchange them. The generator performance stongly depends on the rim distance so we have integrated an automatic shift mechanism to keep the distance between generator and rim constant small. An exchangeable shift-element moves the generator away from the rim and prevents grinding of the generator part.",
      "WEGA VISIBILITY",
      "When we tried to assemble the \"perfect\" bicycle for this technology we were fascinated by the combination with phosphorescent wheels and decided to offer the Magnic Night Bike as reward, too.",
      "These are custom made wheels. In addition to the phosphorescent painting these are high quality welded aluminium rims which you only find on upper class roadbikes (like Shimano or Mavic). Even if \"normal\" rims work good with all Magnic Lights these rims are welded and don't have a magnetic rim joint.",
      "You can turn the rear while and either us as free-wheel single speed bike or as FIXE with rigid hub.",
      "The main technology of our lights is based on eddy current induction.",
      "The core part is the world\u2019s smallest contact- and frictionless bicycle dynamo, that is integrated together with the electronic and the lighting system in the brake shoe of a calliper brake. The world-wide patented technic developed by the German company Magnic Innovations is based on  eddy current induction: a magnetic wheel in a generator separated from the bicycle rim by a narrow air gap induces temporary magnetic fields even in non-magnetic aluminium bicycle rims when the bicycle rim is moving. This leads to the magnetic wheel rotating contactlessly as if by magic.",
      "Neither batteries nor external cables, further fittings or spoke-magnets are necessary. Only the brake shoes have to be exchanged for microlight - brake shoes, so that the maintenance only involves the exchange of worn brake pads after thousands of kilometres. The included brake pads are compatible with other standard brake pads of other manufacturers as available in every cycle shop.",
      "Eddy current",
      "The key is so-called eddy current technology : Energy is drawn from the rotating bicycle wheels without any physical contact, and thus without friction. Instead, eddy currents, created by strong magnets, generate electricity to power the lights: When the wheel spins, magnets inside the generator induce eddy currents with corresponding magnetic fields in the wheel, which in turn interact with the magnets in the generator. The resulting electricity will power your lights indefinitely without any environmentally harmful batteries or cumbersome cables.",
      "While the previous larger Magnic Lights were equipped with two LEDs (one for stand light) Magnic Microlights have just one LED which is fed by ultra-high efficient Mosfet rectifiers.",
      "The SMART VERSION presented here can only be realized within the rangeof this project if we reach the stretch goal of 500.000 \u20ac.  (In case this amount is reached the reward for the SMART VERSION will be available in the rewards section and you can switch if you like).   \nReason for the high stretch goal: High cost for final development of bluetooth control software & electronics. At the moment we have implemented the main features with prototypes based on the electronic boards and microprocessors of the larger MAGNIC LIGHT IC version.",
      "Turn Signals",
      "The Smart version comes with a cool novelty : A blink system for turn signals without any additional switches and even without a smartphone. How does it work? If you tap the brake lever the distance between Microlights and rim changes which can be detected in the lights (even without braking). A double-tap is our signal for the blinker: If you double-tap the right brake lever the rear lights detect the signal and via bluetooth to the front lights- so that lights on the right side are blinking. Correspondingly this works on the left side.",
      "Navigation",
      "Navigation is similar to the turn signals - but here you are guided and need our Smartphone App for navigation: Lights are controlled by the navigation app and start to blink on the left or right side when you have to turn left/right. Put your smartphone in your bag and let the lights guide your way.",
      "Speed Data Transmission",
      "The smart Magnic Microlights are equipped with a Bluetooth LE microcontroller which easily detects the rotation speed of your wheel from the incoming current. Via smartphone or Bluetooth LE compatible speedometer you can receive speed data for display or further processing. This feature replaces Bluetooth LE speed sensors which have the same function but need extra mounting and extra batteries.",
      "Crash detection with emergency call",
      "This feature requires some future development and is still theory. In case of a crash generators will stop abruptly. We need some test data but we are confident to be able to detect a crash situation reliably which can be sent to the smartphone in order to make an emergency call.",
      "Configuraton for Stand light and more",
      "We will offer different stand light patterns which can be set via Smartphone App. Additionally it will be possible to switch the internal orientation of the lights (for example for correct turn signals if your left and right brake levers deviate from standard installations).",
      "Nov. 5th 2018, UPDATE\nConcerning German STVZO approval for our new lighting technology some frustrating years are behind us. But we did not give up and we achieved that the highest responsable committees were invloved in new rules for STVZO approval concerning our technology. Today we were informed that our main ideas could influence the new legislation which shall pass the Verkehrsauschuss (Committee of Transport) of the German Bundestag next month. We believe that the German rules are too complex and old fashioned and hopefully our efforts help to go in the right direction. For our systems (Magnic Light IC, and Magnic Microlights) this is good news because we finally can adjust our lights concerning to these rules.\nFor our technology here are the three most important new rules concerning Magnic Light:",

      "OUR MISSION",
      "Without lighting, cyclists risk their lives in the dark - but those on the road with battery lights will soon be left in the dark when the journey takes too long or the batteries are no longer full. For those who do not want to mount heavy dynamos, use batteries or lay cables, we've launched two Kickstarter projects with our non-contact Magnic Lights, which feel like battery lighting without having to exchange or change batteries. Magnic Microlights can't be turned off at daylight and we are convinced this makes sense from a safety point of view: With lights on your visibilty increases significantly which means a great deal of safety.",

      "As to working prototype, the first time that we made it work in an eyewear form was in 2017. We had discussed of launching it on Kickstarter but didn't take that direction. We knew that something wasn't up to our expectations yet; plus, we had been bitten many times when we tried to take a shortcut in the past, we got a deep understanding of slow is smooth, smooth is fast, and prefer to do it step by step, pay attention to each little detail without bold assumptions. Eventually our hard work paid off, Norm Glasses won CES 2019 Innovation Award, and German Innovation Award recently.",
      "We are ready to mass produce Norm Glasses. The funds raised on Kickstarter would enable us to order electronic and optical components in large quantities with volume discounts, thus making it possible to bring Norm Glasses to everyone with relatively affordable price.

      "Travel mug that makes scalding hot drinks perfect in just 2 minutes and keep them perfect for hours",
      "Carefully engineered with an All-American design, Thero saves your tongue and time from scalding hot drinks, letting you enjoy your favorite coffee at instant coffee speeds. Drinking coffee is a way to get more out of your day and Thero lets you get the most out of your coffee. No more jumping through hoops just to get started.",
      "Temperature adjusting mugs have been around for a while, but Thero is the fastest! We use only the highest grade materials, turning drinks from scalding hot to the perfect temperature in just 2 minutes and keeping them there for 5-6 hours.",
      "In a day and age where we can send people to the moon and colonizing Mars no longer feels like some far off dream, why do we still have to struggle with overly hot coffee? At Thero, we think that life on Earth should be a little simpler and that is what we set out to do with the Thero Magic Mug.",
      "Most coffee is poured at 180-200 degrees Fahrenheit, which is way too hot to drink. At this temperature, coffee will scald your mouth and kill off cells, making it not only unpleasant, but harmful as well. A classic paper cup will take 15-20 minutes to cool down coffee to a drinkable temperature and will become too cold just a few minutes after that. Meanwhile, classic insulated travel mugs will keep your coffee undrinkably hot for hours, unless you take the lid off in which case it will still take half an hour. Thero gets your coffee ready in just 1-2 minutes so you can start drinking the moment you step out the door.",
      "We know that some people like their drinks a little hotter and some a little cooler, so when we say 140 degrees is the perfect temperature we expect some skepticism. The good news is that our perfect temperature is not just an arbitrary number! Deeming 140 degrees the perfect temperature is the result of not only testing what the most popular drinking temperature is, but also working with coffee roasters and taste testers to find the range where premium coffee exhibits its full body of flavor!",
      "Also, we hate cutting corners, so we didn\u2019t! Thero Magic Mugs are designed to work with even boiling hot water so you never have to worry about your drink being too hot to handle. We worked diligently with coffee experts throughout the product design process to create the best product for coffee, but at the same time we wanted to make sure we built something that worked well for our tea loving friends too!",
      "The Thero Magic Mug uses some of the same technology that keeps rocket ships from overheating on launch and reentry to control the temperature of your coffee. Our special space-grade material is designed to absorb excess heat while your drink is above 140 degrees Fahrenheit, quickly bringing it down to that perfect drinking temperature. Then, when your hot drink falls below that perfect temperature, it will release that stored up heat back into your drink. This way you get to savor and enjoy your drink instead of gulping it down.",
      "The coolest thing about this aerospace material is that it does this all on its own. No sensors or electricity required! Just rinse with cool water in between uses to reset the material and let it get rid of any heat it might still be holding on to.",
      "Bringing any product to market can present challenges and unfortunately, delays can occur due to unforeseen circumstances. One possible reason for the potential delay is the holiday rush. We have already identified several manufacturers and wish to complete our order before the holiday season in the OEM's country. Our current timeline has 1-2 months of wiggle room for potential delays and we are trying our best to bring Thero to you ASAP.",

His ship at the time was called the HMS Endeavor \u2013 an apt name for an adventurer\u2019s ship. Captain Cook became so impressed with Maori people that he would return to New Zealand three times, often commenting on the resolve and dedication of the people who lived there.  The Aquacy\u2122 Logo is inspired by the Hei Matau, an at least 2000 year old symbol.  Each Aquacy\u2122 1769 has on the dial the 1769 in distressed font reproduction from James Cook's original map of New Zealand.

      "Below are our simple and straightforward reward tiers. Each reward features the titanium stonewashed GripNGo Driver, and we\u2019re offering free worldwide shipping.

      "Empower children & adults on the spectrum to teach themselves life skills for happy self-sufficiency",
      "[This site is best viewed on a computer not a phone, and images may take time to load.]",
      "The Empowered Brain\u2122 system by Brain Power aims to empower children and adults all along the autism spectrum to teach themselves practical life skills, and assess their progress numerically.",
      "Based on brain science from MIT and Harvard, these apps facilitate life skills such as language, emotional understanding, eye contact, control of behaviors, conversation skills, meltdown prevention, social connection, self-confidence, perspective-taking, and more. The system can help people with autism to better understand, interact with, and enjoy the world around them. These are the skills for self-sufficiency, and we believe that The Soft Skills are the Hard Skills&trade;!",
      "Empowered Brain apps run on Google Glass, which is a very impressive wearable computer. When you wear Glass, you can still see the world around you. Yet you also see (and hear) our social apps at the same time: through the see-through computer screen, and \"bone-conduction\" speaker. This is fundamentally better than an iPad or phone, because with those, your child is looking down and locked in another world. Empowered Brain keeps the wearer (such as your child) heads-up, hands-free, and engaged with the social world!",
      "To give a brief example of one of our apps (\"Emotion Charades\"), the autistic adult or child sees an emoji floating on either side of the partner's face, and tilts her/his head to chose the one that matches the facial expression, for a reward.  Meanwhile, the software automatically monitors her/his performance as well as anxiety or stress level. (Learn more about this app, and our others, down below.)",
      "Afterward, every response, all timings, and even measures of stress and anxiety can be accessed in your web account. It is like automatic session notes for the therapist or teacher, and it includes more data than any person could record during a session. For a parent, you can view past progress and predict the future.",
      "The user is not expected to wear the system all day. It is like piano lessons (but more fun), or sports practice (but can be done at home): to be practiced about 30 minutes per day.",
      "It feels like a video game but is clinically proven to address daily challenges of autism.",
      "We aim to help people with autism be understood, not cured; accepted, not isolated; empowered, not forced. As we say it, we aim to \"empower every brain\"!",
      "A note on language: people prefer different words (e.g. \"autistic\" vs \"with autism\"; or how to describe \"functioning\" levels). At Brain Power, we try to switch among them. We don't want to offend anyone. We just want to do good science and help deserving people improve their lives!",
      "Empowered Brain provides value for parents, therapists, teachers, schools, practitioners, and of course people on the spectrum.  Read more to learn how it can apply to you.",
      "Patents pending worldwide.",
      "We are ready to empower you!",
      "You may have heard rumors about Glass or wondered about the future of the device. The good news is that Google released a new version of Glass a few months ago. We even published the first scientific research paper that shows the new Glass. Further details are down below.  Also, our software can run on the dozens of other smartglasses that have recently emerged. Thus, one way or another Empowered Brain is here to stay!",
      "Brain Power has been in over 250 articles and TV appearances around the world,",
      "We have partners for success! We are amazingly fortunate for their support. (Additional partners listed  down below.)",
      "A small sampling of impressions from parents, teachers, and autistic people.",
      "Crying sudden tears of joy after her son uses Empowered Brain, a Mom realizes she feels more connected with her son than ever before. (Click above to play this TV segment from PBS Newshour.)",
      "Empowered Brain will ship with a suite of social-emotional learning apps, including the 3 that are explained in the main video at the top of this page.  These focus on 1.) decoding emotions, 2.) looking at people when they speak, and 3.) managing the stress and anxiety of transitions. They also address self-confidence, attention, learning mindset, social-referencing, and self-regulation.",
      "These three Empowered Brain apps have already been through clinical trials in children and adults with autism. Results from these successful clinical trials have been published in peer-reviewed medical research journals (see the references section near the bottom of this page for more details).",
      "Please see the main video (click the video-thumbnail at the top of this page) for more about each app and to see the system in action with families touched by autism.",
      "An additional set of apps is scheduled for release shortly, as described even further below. You will receive all the apps that are available at the time of shipping, as well as perpetual patches and updates to them.",
      "Empowered Brain includes several components that work together:",

      "Meet the rest of our scientists, doctors, educators, & engineers below in the full Team Section.",
      "Autism, and our technology, are of interest to many notable people.\n(Pictures are not specific endorsements.)",
      "Above: A few of the hundreds of autistic adults and children who have successfully used the Empowered Brain glasses and software by Brain Power. We have worked with young and old, speaking and non-speaking, around the country and the world.",
      "Our years of experience with hundreds of children and adults all along the spectrum suggest the answer is likely yes. We have  published  peer-reviewed scientific papers showing Empowered Brain is safe, and is usable by autistic individuals across a broad range of ages and speaking / functioning abilities.",
      "Parents are routinely surprised their children will wear these augmented-reality glasses even if they won't wear sunglasses. It may be because these glasses convert people's faces into cartoons, play their favorite music, and turn interacting with others into a rewarding video game.",
      "Our Founder, and the Brain Power team, are deeply committed to bringing this award-winning, technology-based yet human-centric approach to every family touched by autism. That being said, there are some facts we would like to explain briefly.",
      "Brain Power's apps focus on useful and universal skills such as emotional understanding, empathy, eye contact, anxiety and stress management, attention, awareness of environment, transitions, communication skills, habits, and various cognitive skills. We take a very practical approach, and we have met with many, many families in great detail and have brought out tools into their homes and schools.",
      "Importantly, success and progress are measured not just in terms of the specific skill in each app, such as emotion decoding or eye contact. Rather, or in addition, we see success in terms of broadly useful features such as self-confidence, sense of self, agency, and decreases in anxiety. We have clinically observed decreases in ADHD symptoms following Empowered Brain sessions. We have observed flourishing of confidence in children and young adults in their regular lives (outside of sessions with the system) that has made their parents cry in joy.",
      "All of the Empowered Brain modules are engineered for users to teach themselves life skills crucial for happy self-sufficiency, and to generalize these skills into everyday life. We have studies how students in the classroom setting, for instance, apply the skills they learn from Empowered Brain to the rest of their schoolwork and social interactions at school.",
      "All of this is made possible by advanced artificial intelligence and augmented reality inside our patent-pending software. However, the experience to the user (and parent/therapist) is very smooth and simple, and does not feel complicated or \"academic\".",
      "The goal is to empower the user to express more of the raw intelligence, or brain power, she or he already has (but which can sometimes be locked in or masked). Founder, Dr. Ned Sahin, often says that Brain Power \"uses artificial intelligence to unlock natural intelligence.\"",
      "Our apps are designed somewhat like video games, drawing on our natural desire to play and to compete. You can see some of them in action in the campaign video at the top of this page.",
      "What makes our Empowered Brain apps unique is that they are also based on brain science and the principles of a modern movement known as \"serious gaming\". The \"gamification\" of learning and even clinical therapy has been scientifically demonstrated to have a profound positive effect, even in people who don't traditionally play games.",
      "Empowered Brain now runs on all Android smartglasses. This means that we have a long future and can adapt our system to new devices that emerge. That being said, we have selected Google Glass as the smartglasses of choice, after testing with many alternatives.  You will receive a brand-new Google Glass unit in the original factory box.",
      "Empowered Brain is easy to use and we will train you ahead of time to make sure everything is smooth and great.",
      "A heart-breaking question that parents of children with autism have vocalized to us many times is: \u201cWhat would happen to my child once I am gone?\u201d. These and other questions are what make us take our work so deeply seriously, day and night. We are committed to working dilligently, and scientifically, for your family and families like yours, to give answers and to inspire well-grounded hope.",
      "Empowered Brain measures numerical data and can give you a report on progress each day. This empowers you to know how your child is doing, and to make predictions about the future, grounded in real data.",
      "We also have recently developed a set of apps and tools that focus on job-preparedness and then job coaching. Stay tuned for more information.",
      "We know that having a job is probably the highest form of dignity and self-sufficiency, and we are committed to helping people gain employment.",

      "Job Training and Onsite Coaching. For instance, we are finalizing a set of apps that focus on job skills. These form a job-coaching and job readiness platform, and are suitable for individuals who are a bit older and/or are ready for this deeply important life transition.",
      "Anxiety and Stress. Two of our next apps focus on reducing stress and anxiety. They can even work with non-speaking and anxiety-prone individuals. They use artificial intelligence, and patented methods for detecting biomarkers of stress.",
      "Daily Activity Assist. For younger individuals or those working on foundational skills, we have an app that assists some of the simple daily tasks such as brushing teeth; and it makes them wildly fun and motivating.",
      "In short, Empowered Brain includes benefits for young children all the way to adults, and people who do not speak all the way to  people employed at technology companies. Stay tuned for announcements about these newest apps. There is a lot we are ready and able to do! Yet, we need your help to get there. Together, we can rewrite the future of autism! Please, Empower Us!",
      "Empowered brain offers an unprecedented way to evaluate your child\u2019s (or your) performance and progress. Typically a teacher, therapist, or other practitioner would write notes manually after a session. These evaluations are necessarily subjective, and rooted in the practitioner\u2019s particular clinical experience. Our system automatically generates session notes, and they include things like second-by-second accounts of body posture and attention that could not be noted by a human observer; and evaluations can made relative to all the people using the system in the world.",
      "After your child/client uses any of our apps or games, you can go to the web portal for a very detailed analysis of: a) the current game, b) long term progress, and c) predictions for the future.",
      "For instance, how many hundreds of times your child looked away in an hour, when she/he correctly guessed an emotion, levels of measured stress at every moment, minutes spent rocking, which graphics or music or rewards were most preferred, etc, etc.",
      "Example report from a single session from a live clinical trial session.",
      "The system updates the data second-by-second, so you can have a real-time report on the progress of your child during that particular session, as shown in the image above.",
      "Example of a progress report over the course of a month.",
      "The system saves the information of your child\u2019s progress for each game session on a monthly basis. It presents the information to you all in the same place.",
      "Example of a performance report that is mapping the potential growth of the user.",
      "The system saves the child\u2019s data from each of the sessions played, provides a detailed report on his or her progress, and provides information on the child\u2019s potential growth, based on  previous performance.",
      "The cloud-based web portal is advanced beyond anything that currently exists.",
      "Parents often tell us it finally gives them the visibility and insight they have always wanted, and the reassurance of numerical, objective data. They appreciate that the assessment and criteria won't change if they move to a new town or new school, whereas in the past whenever they had a new doctor or teacher the whole evaluation process could start again from scratch.",
      "Therapists (BCBA's, OT's, SLP's, etc) tell us that the idea of automatically-generated session notes, with more detailed data than ever possible, is transformative for their practice. They also say that being able to offer this advanced (yet easy-to-use) technology differentiates them from their competitors.",
      "Brain Power has been humbled and honored to receive a wide range of international as well as community-specific awards:",
      "You have found us on Indiegogo and you might be wondering why we are here.",
      "IndieGoGo is often called a \"crowd funding\" platform, and we are most interested in the \"crowd\"!  We want to reach you, our community, and find ways to make a difference in the lives of thousands of families we might not ever otherwise meet. That is why we are so interested in the \"crowd\". You can hep with this goal by posting this page in parents' groups on social media; and on your own pages. Each voice matters to us, and matters deeply.",
      "The main use of this site is to allow pre-orders of our clinically-tested product. After careful scientific work and lots of time spent immersed in family and classroom and clinical settings with the people we wish to benefit, we are opening orders to the general public! It is an exciting time. Also, Indiegogo is convenient in that it allows us to have a digital \"storefront\" and it manages all the hassles of online selling, for us. Please have a read of this site and we hope you will get the system for your family.",
      "We ship worldwide.",
      "One thing about Indiegogo: we can only keep a campaign open for a few weeks. That is just the way it works. After that, all the selling is over, and the discounts are gone. Therefore, the time for you to get the Empowered Brain system is very limited.",
      "If you have further questions, please contact us at empower@brain-power.com",
      "We elected to use Indiegogo as a way to allow pre-orders of our Empowered Brain product.",
      "Pre-Orders pay for the expensive hardware (Google Glass) and some of the software development we have already done.",
      "Our team of PhD's, MD's, engineers, artists, and more have invested in it for years. We believe Empowered Brain is an extraordinary and cutting-edge product for your family. We have a clear roadmap to finalize it and get it to you. We are looking forward to serving your family's needs.",
      "We have witnessed and can feel many of the struggles you may be going through. For instance, our founder drove around the country in an RV two years ago - visited families in West Virgina,  for example, and autism clinics in Missouri, and residential (24/7 care) facilities in Tennessee, and many more. He slept in the RV, in Walmart parking lots.  The goal was to immerse in the community, and learn.",
      "We have learned, among many other things, that neither the healthcare system nor the educational system can meet all your needs. We know it is painful, and that some products and services are out of your reach. Our founder personally wants our product to reach every family in the world. However, it may take time.",
      "Video from one of our stops on the RV trip. See children delight in using Empowered Brain for the first time. (On the RV trip, the CEO and several team members drove around the country and visited families and clinics far outside our usual zone.)",
      "Empowered Brain represents a totally new technology. It is clinical-grade, it was created by a large team of highly-trained professionals -- and it is the first wave. Technology prices always start high, which is the bad news; but the good news is that they always come way down in price. As we built this company, we learned more about why this happens. There are many reasons. To create something like this takes the coordinated work of many, many talented people, and many costs including salaries, legal fees, infrastructure, rent, computers, clinical trials, government fees, and so much more.",
      "Also, since most people do not have their own Google Glass, we need to include one in our package. The price of Google Glass was set by Google - at $1500. We cannot control that. Luckily, it is a fantastic device, and we have selected it after trying many alternatives.",
      "Eventually, however, the up-front costs like clinical trials and initial development will be repaid. Device prices will come down and devices will be more common. Accordingly we will bring prices down even further.",
      "For now, we are doing the best we can to keep prices low even in this first wave, yet somehow we must pay our staff, and the other costs mentioned above.",
      "Additionally, we created a payments plan, in response to many parents who asked for it. This allows you to pay over time. This means we bear more of the cost and risk, but it means your burden is lower, and we want to help in that way.",
      "Also, many families find funds available that can help them, for instance from health savings accounts, local charities, Medicaid, Elks and Freemasons and other orders, school technology funds, and more.",
      "However, if this is still out of reach, please stay in touch over the year and years. With time, we will find other ways to get something to you and to other families like yours. We are truly committed to \"empower every brain\"!",
      "Several parents told us that it is difficult to order the system with a single transaction, and also that the total cost is difficult in this Holiday time of year. We listened!",
      "Indieogogo itself does not offer any \"payment plans\", for instance where you can pay off the purchase over a long period of time. On Indiegogo every purchase must be paid in a single transaction, immediately. Also, everything must be complete before the end of the campaign (Dec 22) and there is no option to continue after that.  This is just the nature of pre-order or crowdfunding campaigns on Indiegogo.

Prior to the announcement, we have long tested our software on Enterprise Edition, e.g. during our clinical trials, to assure it runs properly on both versions. The results are good news -- for Empowered Brain and for the whole \u201csmartglasses\u201d product category. The heads-up computer category is here to stay. We are committed to a future in which technology helps people connect, and overcome challenges.",

      "Empowered Brain includes:",
      "Empowered Brain\u2019s apps are engineered to empower users to teach themselves life skills crucial for happy self-sufficiency. For example, Emotion Charades is a game that helps teach emotion identification. The Player looks through the Google Glass screen and sees emojis on either side of their partner\u2019s face. With a quick head tilt, he/she chooses which emoji correctly matches their partner\u2019s facial expression, and earns gems. Unlike with other emotion-learning apps in which the Player is looking down at a tablet or phone, our software encourages social interaction with other people, keeping the Player heads-up and hands-free.",
      "Drawing on everyone\u2019s natural desire to play, the apps are played like video games - but they are based on brain science, and draw on the decades of validated success of behavioral interventions for autism.",
      "BTW, our system is designed to be used for 30 min to an hour a day: your child/student will not have to wear it all day to benefit.",
      "You are not replaceable!  But you do probably spend a lot of your time documenting observations in sessions and following up on behaviors between visits.  The Empowered Brain system essentially takes your notes for you, including ones that weren\u2019t possible before - accurately detailing each time the child looks at you or Mom, the duration of stimming episodes, accuracy of emotion decoding, awareness of a new environment, and even heart and breathing rates during the lessons.",
      "Empowered Brain even allows you to review and monitor your clients\u2019 progress between sessions - and because the apps feel like games, your client is more likely to perform. Our goal is to complement your efforts, and help you engage and encourage skill development more efficiently for more clients.",
      "Empowered Brain is designed to carry on where therapist visits leave off, making it easier and more likely for your child to practice certain key skills.  It also allows the therapist to monitor progress remotely and for each visit. If your child improves more rapidly and consistently because of Empowered Brain, it gets him/her on a track to self-sufficiency more rapidly and makes the therapist\u2019s job more efficient.",
      "The system is designed to unlock more power from each therapist visit via better and more engaged practice between visits, closer monitoring, and science-based activities that are designed to speed up progress.  In this way, you can get more value from the dollars spent or therapy sessions used, and advance your child further on the path of self-sufficiency and integration.",
      "We have tested our system with hundreds of children and adults on the autism spectrum!",
      "Parents are routinely surprised by the fact that their child can tolerate Google Glass and our software, and are even more surprised at how rapidly and easily they learn to use it.  Many times in our clinical trial sessions or informal tests, the child is teaching the parent how to use the system within a few minutes! We\u2019ve studied this formally and scientifically during clinical trials in a wide age range, across the autism spectrum. Papers from Stage 1 of our trials are starting to emerge in peer-reviewed scientific and medical literature.  For instance, see the following papers [1] [2] [3] [4]",
      "We cannot guarantee it will work for your unique child, but based on our experience, there is a much better chance than you may think.",
      "No! Please see the details further up in this campaign page.",
      "(The quick answer is: they released a new version of Google Glass just this summer, proving the program is continuing (which we already knew), and Brain Power was selected as one of their few official distribution partners. We are one of the very few companies who can sell Glass!  Also, other manufacturers aside from Google are releasing smartglasses, so there are additional options.)",
      "Well, what do sunglasses do for your child? They mostly put a high-contrast boundary in peripheral vision, where the glasses leave off and the bright sunlight crashes in. That\u2019s neither pleasant nor sensible, and the long-term benefits of wearing sunglasses are relatively remote to a child.",
      "With our glasses, you might become a cartoon character, or a way to earn gold stars and points! The world seems different and more fun, and is on kids\u2019 terms. Our glasses are also a vehicle toward the things that matter so dearly to a child, such as fitting in, getting a date, being invited, and eventually getting a job.",
      "Ultimately that might seem a lot more valuable to a child than sunglasses. And in the end, any minor inconvenience of wearing something may be outweighed by its benefit, in the same way people ultimately learn to wear shoes or clothing. But again, don\u2019t take our word for it -- take a look at our videos and published papers!",
      "Yes. Our current apps span a range of functioning levels and ages, and the apps in development will extend that range even further. For instance, many of us adults can benefit from coaching in subtleties such as knowing when to look at people,  knowing what they\u2019re feeling, and knowing how to mirror back their facial expressions at precisely the right time to make them feel valued and heard. Also, stay tuned for some exciting developments in the works, including job training and job coaching for adults on the spectrum.",
      "You don\u2019t have to!",
      "Think of this like piano lessons. You carry neither your piano nor teacher all day with you, but a half hour or hour a day of concentrated practice teaches the brain needed skills, and goes a long way!",
      "That being said, the device is comfortable and light; and in our scientific studies no major negative effects were reported.",
      "Yes. Like many families use a single computer or iPad for several children, you can give them each a chance to use our apps and benefit in their own customized way. With your parent account you can create up to 3 child accounts (more for teacher or therapist accounts).  Each child's game progress is stored separately -- this way, they can even have a competition! That being said, some children may want or need their own system, much as they may want their own phone or iPad.",
      "No. Setup is quick. Instructions and short \u201chow-to\u201d videos are in your parent/teacher account. You can connect Glass to the internet via WiFi or your phone.",
      "If our software is malfunctioning we will deliver patches remotely to fix it. If it cannot be fixed remotely, we will accept the device back and fix the software. If the hardware breaks, we cannot fix the hardware -- it is all sealed and self-contained like a phone so it is not serviceable and we are not hardware engineers. We cannot issue refunds of your orders. However, when you receive Empowered Brain you will have 15 days to test it, and to return it for a refund if it does not work for you.",
      "Every dollar you help raise translates directly to helping children and adults on the spectrum.",
      "No. At Brain Power we are deeply respectful of people on the autism spectrum, and of each human being\u2019s right and desire to independently express his or her own personality. There is no one normal and there is no one right way to be. We already have multiple apps for multiple types of skills and are making more.  We try to make very different experiences for different challenges, and we focus on challenges that affect everyone (but generally affect people on the spectrum more).",
      "At the core, our mission is about happy self-sufficiency, and about empowering you and your child to unlock the prodigious power of every brain.",
      "The scientific team at Brain Power has previously authored several dozen peer-reviewed papers in high-impact medical journals, including Science and Nature Neuroscience.",
      "Below are some of the papers from the first part of Stage 1 of the Empowered Brain clinical trials. They include the first appearance in the scientific literature of the new version of Google Glass (the Enterprise Edition), and  the first appearance of autism-related work on any version of  Glass. The papers clinically demonstrate that Empowered Brain is a safe, feasible, and tolerable approach to aid children and adults on the autism spectrum. They also show that the system can function for individuals aged 4 to 24 and older, speaking and non-speaking, in clinic and at school.",

      "With the Nommi app, you can easily access and manage your device from your smartphone.",
      "You will be online in 132 countries with fast LTE data and relevant plans. We do also have wi-fi hotspot coverage in 160 countries globally.",
      "Prevent unauthorized access to your network and conceal personal data.",
      "By default, Nommi is configured to automatically encrypt all your data through secure servers when you connect to public wifi networks. Although VPN brings extra security, it can make connections slower, so feel free to disable it via the app for the networks you trust.",
      "Making the most of your networks - Nommi only offers the best wifi connection for fast downloading and browsing.",
      "Data is expensive and constantly searching for a local wifi network is exhausting. With Nommi, you\u2019ll never miss out on a strong wifi connection speed and the best part is, you\u2019re simultaneously saving money and data.",
      "Nommi gives you unlimited access to it's worldwide Wi-Fi database and tests surrounding wifi networks before taking you off 4G.",
      "Nommi\u2019s dual-wifi feature is on by default and constantly scans available wifi networks as a background process. When it finds a quality wifi network, it will check to see if our crowdsourced password database contains a password for it. If a password matches, Nommi will try to connect, testing the speed of the network without interrupting your current cellular connection. Once everything checks out, Nommi initializes VPN over the network, tests it one more time and only then starts to route your traffic over public wifi. Ultimately this feature saves your cellular data allowance. As a Nommi user, not only do you have access to a large existing database of passwords, but you can also help curate this global database and share passwords with others by adding them via the app.",
      "Keep your personal network private but still share Nommi with friends.",
      "Similar to professional wifi routers, Nommi will provide two wifi networks (SSID) connections. The primary is your own private wifi network, secured by a strong password and encryption, to which you connect your own devices: laptop, ipad, smart watch, printer, etc. The secondary is a guest wifi network made specifically for your friends and colleagues. This guest wifi allows them to connect without password, but only after the app has notified you and asked for permission. Never again will you have to read the alphabet off the back of your router or spell out complex symbols for your visiting friends. When they are connected, they will be isolated from your primary private network space. Via the app, you\u2019ll also be able to see who is currently connected and how much data they\u2019ve used.",
      "Your long distance relationship solved - Nommi provides a wider reach for low signal areas.",
      "It\u2019s fairly common to have low wifi signal depending on where your home router is located. Let\u2019s say you get bad connection in your room because your router is downstairs. Nommi will automatically extend to the fastest available nearby network, doubling your wifi signal range. You can also specify which signal you want to extend to in the \u201cWi-fi Extender\u201d section via the Nommi app. This feature is useful not only at home, but more importantly at hotels, where you only get good wifi signal near the door, because there\u2019s 1 wifi router per floor. Leave Nommi halfway between you and the wired router location and enjoy strong wifi signal.",
      "Nommi keeps up with the latest technology by combining power and connectivity in one device.",
      "No need to carry that old-fashioned personal hotspot device or a power bank any more. The Nommi Power version combines both.",
      "Place and charge - Remove the burden of disconnecting and inserting a charging cable every time you need you pick up your phone.",
      "Charge your phone using our Qi charger by simply placing your device directly onto the Nommi Power charging pad. Compatible with all Qi-enabled devices, there is no need to plug your device into a wall charger or USB port. It\u2019s extremely convenient and avoids having to buy new USB cables every time your old one breaks. Qi wireless charging is supported by most Android flagship smartphones (Samsung Galaxy, Google Nexus and Pixel, etc) and Apple\u2019s latest iPhone 8 and iPhone X models.",
      "Nommi\u2019s strong battery is intended to keep your charge high over long periods of time.",
      "Nommi\u2019s Slim version has a high performance 3500mAh battery that can deliver more than 16 hours of battery life when 4G/wifi sharing. Nommi\u2019s Power version has a 10000mAh battery that can operate around 48 hours with 4G/wifi sharing. When using the wireless charging function on the Power version, the battery will last long enough to charge your iPhone twice and still work for 24 hours as a 4G/wifi sharing hotspot.",
      "Nommi is the perfect accessory for your next trip.",
      "Finally, the bulky, boring brick that we know as a Power Bank has been revamped to one sleek, portable design. Nommi is convenient and comfortable to hold in your hand and still flat enough to put your smartphone on it. Both the Slim and the Power version are lightweight and compact, designed to take up minimal space in your already packed suitcase, carry-on or purse.",
      "Which model is right for you?",
      "We both [Alyona and Kairat] love traveling. As soon as you exit the airport doors, you smell new scents, feel the temperature, and hear street sounds. You see what people look like, how they dress and know you\u2019re about to have a new life experience. All the feels aside, we also like to stay hyper connected with easy access to our email and social media. It\u2019s the first thing we check in the morning and the last thing we scroll through before bed. When the plane lands, we want to be connected instantly.",
      "Why wasn\u2019t there a device that kept us connected abroad?",
      "Kairat and I met for the first time at an IT conference where we discussed this recurring issue and so, the idea of Nommi was born.",
      "What about one that is equally useful at home to avoid multiple devices?",
      "We spent hours brainstorming the idea in cafes, with friends, even boring our relatives with talks of Nommi. Finally, we decided to start a business to figure out if we were the only ones with this problem.",
      "We ended up learning there are plenty of people like us - people who are not satisfied with the current solutions, who don\u2019t want to buy a monthly data plan when coming to a country for just 3 days, who want to pay just for what they use. We brought up a team around the concept and did tests for more than a year.",
      "Now we\u2019re here, launching our crowdfunding campaign with our first working prototype which you can check out live in action below:",

      "How does Nommi work?",
      "It acts as usual personal hotspot (mifi), but without need to get new local sim card when you travel. Also it saves your data plan allowance by routing your traffic over wifi networks. The Power version has 10000 battery to provide power bank with with QI wireless charging.",
      "Do I have to buy a monthly subscription in order to use Nommi?",
      "No, not at all. Besides, if for any reason you don\u2019t want that option, you can still insert your data sim card into the standard sim slot that Nommi has, or use Nommi only as dual wifi repeater and range extender (plus powerbank feature in Powerbank version). Please keep in mind, that if you've purchased Nommi via crowdfunding, we provide you with updated wifi passwords in our crowdsourced database free for life. In short, you can still get better wifi experience even without any subscription.",

      "Are there hidden extra/fees I should know about?",

This led me to apply to Khwopa Engineering College in Bhaktapur, Nepal, where I studied electrical engineering, and began my journey into the engineering universe.",
      "In college, I really began to understand what I was meant to do: build things.",
      "I transformed from a kid with lots of wacky ideas to a professional engineer with a mental framework for problem solving. Once the earthquake hit, I was immediately able to put my engineering training and passion to work.",
      "The desperation I felt when the earthquake hit compelled me to conceive of some way to help these people - my neighbors - and my engineering background inspired me to devise a temporary, portable power source.",
      "It dawned on me that a solar powered mobile phone charger that could also power some other devices and which also had a flashlight was an ideal, economical solution.",
      "I drove to my Engineering Lab in Kathmandu, and I got to work on building a prototype. I scrapped together a spare solar panel, some electrical cables, solder, a soldering iron, and a variety of spare electrical parts, and spit out a prototype. Here it is:",
      "A stroke of serendipity hit when manufacturers with whom I developed relationships when I was in college participating in tech hackathons became interested in partnering with me to build the product.",
      "I showed the prototype to Sir. Bal K Joshi of thamel.com and he promised me he would help me manufacture the product so that it reaches to the needy. He introduced me to Ghampower, a solar company in Nepal.",
      "I got to know about Bal Sir from Idea Studio Nepal. Idea studio is the platform that turns business ideas into reality by providing networks, funds and business strategies. I am fortunate that I was selected from my idea to initiate a robotics lab in Nepal couple of years ago. Because of Idea studio that I was able to talk with Joshi Sir and his network. Idea studio provided me with all necessary networks that I needed to explore. Idea studio is currently executing its 2nd session to find out sustainable business ideas. Thanks to idea studio for opening up opportunity.",
      "With funds from Joshi Sir and with help from Ghampower, I was able to develop 500 such lights in just couple of weeks. The lights were sent to different rural districts of Nepal. Some of those lights were sent to Gorkha, the epicenter of the first earthquake where most houses were destroyed and there were thousands of casualties.",
      "In persuading the manufacturers to back me, it didn\u2019t hurt that I had already sold 100 of the devices, and I had an impressive order book for many hundreds more.",
      "We quickly ramped up and went into mass production, and with experience, we figured out how to make an even less expensive and higher quality product. The device now costs only $20 per unit - 3x less than competing devices in Nepal - and it not only operates as a mobile recharger but it also has and two lights attached to illuminate the device. The unit also includes a rechargeable torch-light which operates as a super flashlight.",
      "When I first conceived of the idea, I was only thinking of designing a relatively cheap product to solve a desperate problem. However, working with the manufacturers forced me to focus on building a very high quality, reliable product, not just a cheap one. Now, allow me to give you a more detailed look at Nepal\u2019s Light.",
      "The conditions I encountered trying to build the light were less than ideal. Just imagine a situation where you have to walk 5 Kilometers just to get a single LED light or a solar panel. I still remember that while I was was working on the final design at the factory an aftershock hit and we were terrified! In spite of this, I continued to work and finally completed the prototype and began manufacturing the product.",
      "I need help in making this light a real product for the world.",
      "I want to reach each and every village where there is no light and people still have no way to charge their mobile phones. To do this, I need funding in order to make a better product so that product works fine for longer time. I also need funding because we need to manufacture in high speed so that people in need get access to this light sooner.",
      "As noted, we were able to manufacture 500 Nepal\u2019s Lights. We are now working on an improved version of the product on Collaborizm, as well as crowdfunding $10,000 on IndieGoGo to add new features to the device and to scale production to 5,000 more units.",
      "Under the hood we are using:",
      "Nepal's Light comes equipped with a model x solar charger. It is is durable and is designed for outdoor use.",
      "The light, states here, can power an average home for 12 hours .",
      "The Light comes with 2 chargers for cell phones, and can charge 5 phones for 1 hour.",
      "While my product addresses a major problem confronting Nepalis and I conceived of it out of my concern for my community, I must acknowledge that my venture is for profit\u009d - I am young and I support myself - though I only intend to cover my costs and make a modest return.",
      "We have a viable business model; i.e. we have proven that we have a scaleable business and have secured adequate manufacturing capacity from reputable sources, we have a strong engineering/technical team, and we have reliable distribution channels.",
      "We are looking to manufacture 5,000 Nepal's lights with this money. It costs approximately $18 to manufacture 1 Nepal's Light charging station. The $10,000 will aid in this process.",
      "We will need the funds to also ship the products in Nepal, and other neighboring markets where people are desperate for a cheap light and charging station. It will cost approximately $10 to ship each product. The $10,000 will aid in this process.",
      "I am the inventor of Nepal's Light. I am 25 years old and studied at Khwopa Engineering College in Bhaktapur, Nepal, where I focused on electrical engineering. When the earthquake devastated my country, I knew I had to apply my training to help my community.",
      "I first learned about Collaborizm when I had just built and was distributing 500 of my prototype devices to my community. The platform appealed to me because I had been working on my project alone, and Collaborizm allowed me to network with people who possess skills complementary to my own - around the world.",
      "Collaborizm also allowed me to meet people with business experience who mentored me on converting my idea into a full scale business. Becoming part of this sophisticated, supportive community has given me confidence to launch an IndieGoGo campaign to raise $10,000 which I would use to add features to Nepal's Light (e.g., make it WiFi and GPS enabled, so that users could monitor and control the device via their cellphones and so users can be located in the event of another catastrophe.)",

      "We are creating an all new controller, which requires all new tooling (large steel molds to produce 1,000's of copies of a part), which has a large upfront cost.  A crowdfunding campaign is a great way to get a large quantity of orders waiting to put that tooling to use right away so it quickly pays for itself by producing valuable parts, rather than sitting unused.",
      "Our first controller was successfully launched with a crowdfunding campaign, so we decided to do it again for the ViVi II. This time we put in even more time and effort planning our campaign, and used all the lessons and skills we learned to better prepare for manufacturing to scale up our volume to be able to offer a new, lower price.",
      "Finally, while the funding raised by a crowdfunding campaign is important for covering the costs of tooling and a large initial order, it's not the only reason we chose to launch on this platform again.  The value we received from backers of our first campaign, the interactions, feedback, and lasting relationships, played a monumental role in our long-term success and to this day continues to have an impact driving innovation and improvements with our technology.",

    "company_name": "Oli Woods",
    "allParagraphs": [
      "The first updating paper poster, never forget to check the weather again.",
      "What is the Typified Weather Poster?",
      "This screen printed poster uses smart ink and a tiny internet connected computer to reflect the day's changing weather. As the weather forecast changes, so will the ink on the paper. The icons take 5-15 minutes to fully activate and will update throughout the day as needed.",
      "How it fits into your life",
      "Check the weather with a glance before you leave the house.",
      "Screen-free your morning.",
      "Un-intrusive tech which won\u2019t compete for your attention.",
      "Who is Typified?",
      "Typified is a small team who develop internet-connected products alongside a host of collaborators. We aim to release products which don\u2019t ask anything of you to do their job, but help you in your day to day life. These products will be less intrusive ways of expressing the internet and have strong Art and Design influences.",
      "We\u2019ve spent the last 18 months figuring out how a paper poster, printed with smart ink could be controlled by a tiny internet connected computer. Our first product which uses this technology is the updating Weather Poster.",
      "Why paper and smart ink?",
      "We live in an incredible age of connected information but the ways that it integrates into our lives is often intrusive and overly demanding. Screens ensnare our attention and then usually keep it for much longer than we feel good about. Because the Weather Poster is literally a printed poster without any light emitting elements, you don't have the nagging sensation to look at it like you would a phone or TV screen. We also think of the Poster as equal parts Art and Technology, it has rich colours and tiny imperfections from the screen printing process as well as exclusivity as each design is limited to a run of 500. This sits in stark contrast to screens which are produced in the millions of units.",
      "Why just the Weather?",
      "We think there is a place for less attention demanding products which just take care of one important task in an ultra convenient way, whilst also adding to the look and feel of your home or workplace.",
      "How do I use it?",
      "Once you\u2019ve plugged in the poster and connected it to your Wifi, it will never ask for more than a glance from you to do it\u2019s job. Simply, by hanging it up in your house or office it will naturally catch your eye as you move through your day.",
      "How can ink on paper change?",
      "Smart ink is any ink that\u2019s been engineered at a chemical level to change colour in response to a certain stimulus. Our new technology allows the tiny computer to interface with the smart ink. We don\u2019t think the internet has ever been expressed through paper and ink in this way.",
      "What you get with the Typified Weather Poster:",
      "What weather can it display?",
      "The poster shows the weather at 8am, 12pm, 4pm and 8pm. It only shows 1 day's weather forecast at a time, so if it\u2019s 4pm and the poster displays 8am sunny, this is information about the morning you\u2019ve already had. The different weather types are grouped into 1 of 3 symbols; rainy, cloudy or sunny. The criteria our software uses is based on how you would dress/act according to the weather e.g. you would probably act similarly to 'thunderstorm\u2019 and \u2018rain\u2019, likewise with \u2018sunny\u2019 and \u2018partly sunny\u2019. Here is a key of how we\u2019ve grouped the different weather types.",
      "If you live in a very hot house",
      "Past 29C/84F, the smart ink will start activating on its own. The average room temperature in Australia, Canada, America and the UK is most often cited between 18C/64F - 21C/70F. The World Health Organization recommends home temperatures to be 18C/64F for healthy adults. If your house does reach 29C/84F, it just means all of the icons will start activating and you\u2019ll have to wait for the house to cool down before checking the weather. It doesn't damage the poster.",
      "If your house is consistently 29C/84F and over, we wouldn't recommend purchasing the poster.",
      "Where did the idea come from?",
      "The original idea of an updating weather poster came at my parents house, in the UK. We were all in the kitchen, chatting and enjoying each other's company when the topic of \u2018the weather\u2019 came up. Seconds later, we were all on our phones, and the moment had gone. It had been replaced with us all concentrating on our little screens, our attention had shifted from the real word to our screens and then stayed there.",
      "The walls seemed the most accessible place to keep this ever-changing stream of information. But, from something less intrusive and stimulating than a screen. A nicely printed poster or a piece of art which could change and update seemed like a good alternative.",
      "Product development process",
      "We worked for about 18 months on figuring out how the poster would work; iterating through the electronic, software, industrial and graphic design as well as figuring out how to actually print the smart ink (it\u2019s particle size is about 10x bigger than that of standard ink). There was at least two occasions where we thought we\u2019d hit a legitimate dead end, but we eventually found ways to make it work.",
      "Screen printing",
      "The studio who we\u2019ve teamed up with is Dangerfork in Melbourne, Australia. They\u2019re super passionate and are really into the challenge of working with our smart inks.",
      "From their website: \u201cComing to life in 2010, Dangerfork is a Melbourne based boutique printing company and print gallery with the passion of having artists printing for artists\u201d.",
      "Screen printing delivers more depth and richness of colour than other commercial printing methods. It is also far more expensive, but we feel the final result is worth the increased cost.",
      "image: Dangerfork.com",
      "Set up and connectivity",
      "Connecting the Weather Poster to the internet is easy and uses the same method printers use. Simply turn the weather Poster on at the wall, and then within the next 45 seconds, push the WPS button on your router. For corporate offices, we will supply a quick and easy setup guide for connecting the poster to enterprise Wifi networks (<5mins).",
      "Hanging the poster",
      "The Weather Poster has a custom back plate which allows hanging via a nail in the wall or via stick-on strips. We use the '3M' branded strips and have been very happy with them.",
      "The complete poster weighs 1.6kg/3.4lbs, stick-on strips usually mention their max hanging weight on the pack. If there is enough demand, we can add a reward tier which includes a set.",
      "Finished product manufacture process",
      "The actual poster is screen-printed in Melbourne, Australia which gives rich colours that have more in common with an original piece of art than a mass produced poster. The electronic circuitry is made via modern PCB manufacture and pick and place machines. The micro computer is sourced from a Northern American IOT company. The frame is made from American oak with a glass pane. The back plate is vacuum formed and additional internal components are CNC machined.",
      "The components",
      "Exclusive print runs",
      "Electronics are generally mass manufactured, with hundreds of thousands of the exact same design being produced. A lot of this is due to the minimum order quantities and the tooling costs involved in modern electronics manufacture. Whilst the electronics in our updating posters have to obey these \u2018minimum order quantity\u2019 dynamics, the printed poster does not. This allows Typified to release limited runs and exclusive designs.",
      "All of our posters will be Exclusive print runs of 500, before changing the design. We will have 5 very similar designs per series, before changing the visual theme entirely for the subsequent series.",
      "Weather forecast access",
      "We're supplying two years of free weather forecasts with each poster. We pay a small amount for every weather forecast requested by a poster. After this free two year period, it will be $7.50USD per year. This is less about making money and more about building a sustainable business in the long term. We will have a web page set up nearer the time, which will allow you to 'top up'.",
      "Of course there any many places on the internet to find the weather for free, this is possible due to government backing or advertising. It is a mammoth task for our weather information provider to sustain a huge ever-changing database of all the different weather, in all of the different places in the world. When we call upon their database, they have no way of making advertising revenue. Hence, we have to pay a very small amount each time. The poster checks in with the database every hour (during the day) to make sure it has the most recent forecast, so over a year you can see how this adds up.",
      "The Team & Collaborators",
      "Third party help",
      "Within our Kickstarter goal, we have included budget for an independent circuit board design review from one of the best hardware startup consultancies. They have been responsible for bringing multiple products to market, some of which are stocked in Apple stores.",
      "We're using a company here in Australia for our electronics certification. Again, this has been included in our budgeted Kickstarter goal.",
      "Why we will succeed",
      "We have completely manufacturable prototypes made up entirely of components from our suppliers. All of our suppliers are ready to go and we\u2019ve reviewed all of their product (apart from packaging).",
      "The remaining design jobs include tweaking the final circuit-board and back plate design as well as implementing a wifi connection script and automation. We\u2019ve been working on this project for 18 months and were not comfortable launching this Kickstarter until we knew we could fulfil our orders and deliver on what the poster promises.",
      "Why we need your backing?",
      "We need your backing on this project so we can purchase our first order, certification as well as a design review, we can bring then bring the poster to market. We truly believe you will love having a Typified Weather Poster in your home. If you feel the same way, please back us below and help us bring this new kind of product to market.",
      "Thank you!",
      "-------------------------------",
      "Shipping Goals",
      "Our last two prototypes have been made entirely from our suppliers manufactured parts. There is a bit more work to be done but it\u2019s all do-able. We aim to fulfil orders within 6 months time, we feel like we can deliver a lot quicker than this but Kickstarter campaigns are notorious for delivering late so we would prefer to have this buffer.",
      "Timeline",
      "Our vision for the future",
      "We want to create products which are less intrusive ways of expressing the internet and changing information, ways more akin to Art and Design. By hanging the Weather Poster up in the main area of your house/office, you will know the weather without any habitual change or effort. This dynamic of uultra-conveniencewhere information is effortlessly received without even thinking about it really interests us.",
      "Risks and challenges",
      "\u2022 We still need to file for certification, we have chosen a partner who we will work with here in Australia. The Weather Poster is fairly low power and uses a fully certified power supply and connectivity module. Paper combined with electronics is uncommon, but not unheard of i.e. printers.",
      "\u2022 Past 29 degrees C, the smart ink will start activating on its own. The average room temperature in Australia, America and the UK is most often cited between 18c - 21c and the World Health Organisation recommends home temperatures to be 18c for healthy adults. \nIf your house does reach 29c+ it just means all of the icons will start activating and you\u2019ll have to wait for the house to cool down again before checking the Weather.

First, we spray the parts with laser spray (as shown in a previous update), then laser them, and finally wash off the excess spray, leaving behind a durable graphic.

      "54 precision-engineered parts transform into a card-sized writing tool that fits in your pocket.",
      "From 3D-printed tests to material trials with aluminum, steel, brass, and titanium, every detail was perfected. Every curve, every edge, serves a purpose beyond aesthetics, balancing function and beauty.",
      "HANCEPT Zero Mk2 is crafted with 54 precision-engineered components\u2014the highest number ever in a pen. Each piece is meticulously designed with a distinct purpose, forming the core technology that reliably wraps and protects the pen point.",
      "We put a lot of effort into making HANCEPT Zero Mk2 the perfect pen shape. \nIn particular, the shape of the pen point holder is a structure that transforms from a card shape, so a special engineering structure was required.",
      "After much research and development, we have completed an entirely new engineering structure that is normally stored in side for durability and protrudes when necessary to form a certain angle.",
      "Zero Mk2 is crafted from premium materials like 316L stainless steel, 6000-series aluminum alloy, durable POM, and powerful N52 neodymium magnets. Even after repeated drops, it stays intact, ensuring exceptional durability while maintaining its sleek design and smooth functionality.",
      "Aiming for the perfect credit card size, HANCEPT Zero Mk2 not only focused on the area but also on achieving a thinness that allows for storage in a wallet.",
      "Despite its complex structure with numerous metal parts organically connected, everything (excluding the pen refill) has been implemented in just 2mm thickness. \n\nThis means it's about the thickness of two credit cards, allowing it to be easily stored in a standard card wallet without any issues.",
      "In just about 4 seconds, the HANCEPT Zero transforms into a perfect writing tool.",
      "Its familiar hexagonal bar shape offers immediate comfort, while the carefully chosen length and grip ensure convenience for any task, whether it\u2019s signing a quick autograph or writing a long letter. Above all, its unique design and structural beauty are sure to capture attention, making it more than just a writing tool\u2014it\u2019s a statement.",
      "HANCEPT Zero is the essence of metal, made from aluminum alloy, stainless steel, and magnetic materials, ranging from the pen refill to the exterior and interior parts and the pen nib.",
      "It features a unique surface luster, durability that protects against impacts, advanced technology, and exceptional corrosion resistance used in aviation and chemical industries.",
      "Weighing less than 1 ounce (28g), the HANCEPT Zero strikes the perfect balance between substance and comfort.\n\nThrough a precise blend of composite metal materials, it achieves a luxurious weight that feels substantial without being too heavy or too light, ensuring a premium writing experience.",
      "The compact size doesn\u2019t sacrifice its performance, ensuring you\u2019re ready for any moment when a pen is needed while adding a touch of elegance to your wallet.",
      "Showcase your product with elegance using our sturdy and stylish display stand. Designed for optimal visibility, it adds a touch of sophistication to any space while keeping your item secure and easily accessible.",
      "You can choose from hundreds of display options depending on the installation direction of the stand, the form of the Hancept Zero Mk2, and the position of the magnetic connection.",
      "Made from soft, full-grain leather, it offers a refined design while keeping your card safe and secure. Featuring 2 storage compartments and Hancept\u2019s signature octagonal corner details, it enhances durability by protecting the edges from wear and tear.",
      "Protect your surfaces with our soft and durable display stand pad. The non-slip base ensures stability while safeguarding against scratches and damage, making it the perfect addition to enhance both functionality and aesthetics.",
      "Whether it's for a special occasion or to make your item truly yours, the engraving adds a bespoke element that elevates the overall experience.",
      "\u203b Engraving Notes",
      "We plan to ship HANCEPT Zero Mk2 via airmail, to reduce product damage and long delivery wait times.",
      "Please note however that depending on your region, delivery times may vary from the day of dispatch. We may be able to provide backers with tracking information upon request. We will post an update regarding the shipping schedule once our project ends.",
      "Our logistics partners will make every effort to minimize additional fees upon delivery. However, as these fees are determined by your country\u2019s local customs regulations, taxes, and policies, we cannot guarantee or cover all potential charges. Any additional charges incurred after the initial dispatch of the HANCEPT Zero Mk2 will be the responsibility of the recipient.",
      "Due to the unpredictable nature, and varying policies for each country and delivery region, we cannot cover these fees in advance or include them in our shipping fees. We strongly encourage all backers to double-check their local policies regarding imports from other countries.",
      "The HANCEPT Zero Mk2 is manufactured and shipped from the Republic of Korea, and therefore is not significantly affected by recent U.S. tariff increases on products from China. Changes or reductions of the product's declared value, product type, or product made cannot be made.",
      "HANCEPT is a brand that combines the Korean word \"HAN,\" meaning \"one,\" with the English word \"CONCEPT,\" reflecting our commitment to introducing uniquely one-of-a-kind products to the world.",
      "The journey to bring HANCEPT Zero to mass production was filled with countless trials and refinements. Over 20 complete redesigns were undertaken, and through multiple prototype validation phases and partial renewals, a total of 34 design modifications were made.",
      "From 3D-printed shape verifications to rigorous material testing with aluminum, steel, brass, and titanium, every aspect of strength, weight, and durability was examined. No shape in HANCEPT Zero exists purely for aesthetics\u2014each form serves a purpose, creating a perfect balance of function and beauty.",
      "One of the greatest engineering challenges in developing HANCEPT Zero was perfecting the nib holder. While the idea of rolling a flat plate into a pen is not new, achieving a fully functional nib structure is a different challenge altogether.",
      "Designing a mechanism that forms a precise 20-degree angle was already complex, but fitting this entire structure within a mere 2mm thickness added another level of difficulty. Beyond the mechanical design, ensuring durability and manufacturability required extensive engineering, testing, and refinement.",
      "Ultimately, we developed the patented nib holder that defines HANCEPT Zero, a proprietary technology registered both domestically and internationally.",
      "The average human hair has a thickness of 0.1mm. To perfect HANCEPT Zero\u2019s seven folding hinges and reciprocating slide mechanism, an astonishing precision of 0.01mm\u2014one-tenth the thickness of a hair\u2014was required.",
      "With 54 interlocking components, even the smallest deviation could cause cumulative errors, affecting the overall functionality and precision of the pen.",
      "Since a minor flaw in a single part could impact the entire transformation mechanism, precise manufacturing was essential. To meet these stringent requirements, we employed precision CNC machining\u2014one of the most advanced metal molding and machining technologies available, ensuring each component was crafted with meticulous attention to detail and perfection.",
      "With extensive feedback from our first model,\nwe pushed the design even further to create HANCEPT Zero Mk2.",
      "Every aspect has been refined\u2014from edge and corner enhancements to an optimized folding mechanism. The structure is now sleekly trimmed for smoother storage, reinforced to prevent reverse bending, and engineered for a stronger hexagonal frame that holds firm even under twisting forces. The result? A sleeker, stronger, and more seamless evolution of a groundbreaking design.",
      "It is not simply a pen produced by machines. Inspired by the handcrafting process of premium automatic watches, it is made purely through physical assembly methods without bonding, except for the magnetic fixing process. Every step is meticulously performed by the hands of highly skilled artisans.",

      "It took years of practice crafting quality instruments before we could build the Populele 2 Pro. Every note of this treasured Hawaiian instrument comes to life with a rich and bright sound that\u2019s balanced across the whole musical scale. For the strings, we opted for PVDF carbon fiber, because it offers better elasticity and lasts longer than nylon. And we gave the Populele 2 a broader soundboard, so it has a wider area to vibrate on every note.",
      "The Populele 2 has a unique design that\u2019s soft around the edges and big on curves. It\u2019s molded from carbon fiber for great sound and lasting durability. Unlike a wooden instrument, the carbon fiber body isn\u2019t affected by weather like humidity or cold. It never shrinks or expands, so your sound stays true whether you play it in the islands or play it in the desert.",

The physical bottle holds three specially curated different yet complementing fragrance bases inside. The precise blending system creates various scent combinations, giving you the ability to add even the smallest fraction of one scent base into the mix to change the fragrance outcome.",
      "Variety is the spice of life. Fragrances enhance how we feel. There are fragrances for day, night, dress-up events, casual situations, work... Certain fragrances work better than others though \u2013 that warm winter fragrance could overwhelm on a fresh summers\u2019 day whereas a delicate summer fragrance could lose its subtle impact in the winter.",
      "What fragrance is best to wear to the office? Which one for a date? Which one for your meeting with the president?",
      "NINU's master perfumers premade recipes for you with the two main selection options based on where you are going or how you want to feel. You can opt for one style of fragrance for work and another for an evening out, or any of dozens of different options. Rather than having a cluttered shelf of half-empty bottles, achieve it all with one.",
      "There is an overwhelming fragrance selection available. How are you to discover the one for you?",
      "Input your preferences and the NINU app will suggest a fragrance mix to try. If that\u2019s not enough, there\u2019s plenty of room to play around with adjusting scents to your taste. When you find your scent, save it to your personal scent wardrobe inside the app.",
      "NINU allows you to turn the formula upside down and create new mixes to keep things fresh.",
      "Chances are you don\u2019t feel the same every single day, so why should your fragrance be any different?",
      "Wearing the right fragrance for the right occasion makes a world of difference. NINU tracks your scent tendencies, time of day, and the weather outside and by using Artificial Intelligence (AI) enhancement it suggests certain scents to fit your current day and mood \u2013 all to fill your day with a perfect confidence-boosting scent. Think of NINU as a perfumer following you around making a perfect perfume mix ONLY for you.",
      "The heart and soul of NINU reside in its fragrances: sets of different yet complementing perfumes that work great in a variety of ratios. The team of master perfumers having the courage to making a new concept come alive was lead by the talented Dominique Moellhausen of Milano based Moelhausen Srl with more than 50 years of tradition. Moellhausen stands out as one of the world's leading family-run companies in the industry of fragrances. Dominique\u2019s dedication to the art and admirable contributions in the industry awarded her \u201cPerfumer of the Year\u201d at the 2020 Beautyworld Middle East Awards.",
      "There are 3 different fragrance sets available. Each set contains 3 complementing fragrances that can be mixed in different rations to output dozens of variances in different intensities. Each individual scent has been matched perfectly together by ensuring the same perfume concentration, preventing one fragrance from overwhelming another. For the most striking results, each set contains perfumes with different notes rather than pairing perfumes with similar characteristics. Individual fragrances selected in each set represent a specific category based on their characteristics: CASUAL / WORK / ELEGANT.",

      "The birth of NINU was an inspiration by one of the greatest Slovenian innovators and of the whole perfume industry that passed away 1 year ago in his respective 101st year - Peter Florjan\u010di\u010d. Over 70 years ago Peter was the guy who made the last huge perfume extraction innovation \u2013 the atomiser spray. He made perfumes more appealing by making application easy, and made them portable and leak proof. From his inspiration we spent multiple sleepless nights to come up with an innovation that would tribute to the legacy of Mr. Florjan\u010di\u010d and to innovate and awaken a technologically sleeping industry.",
      "When we researched the perfume industry, we saw that people encountered many problems with perfumes. The most prominent ones were: difficult time discovering the right scent for themselves, buying a perfume and then one cannot change it after feeling differently or simply getting tired of the same old scent, thereby creating the need for multiple perfumes to suit all their moods and occasions.",
      "We played with the thought of how we could solve this problem. The final idea was born when we attended a perfume making school in Paris \u2013 we got to smell a completely different perfume when we only changed the ratio of ingredients by a droplet or two! One of the big takeaways was also the fact how fun it was to mix different ratios of fragrances!",
      "With this knowledge, we wanted to create an advanced perfume mixing device that would be simple to use. We teamed up with the most capable engineers we could find to make the tech work. We designed the app to be as simple as possible. We also put a big focus on the design of the device so that it would complement the high-end product that it is. After the adventures of samplings we finally completed the core of the product \u2013 the fragrances! Finally, after countless tests with test users and countless sleepless nights), NINU was ready to be shown to the WORLD!",
      "Why the name NINU? NINU was one of the first perfumes in recorded history. The story goes back to ancient Babylonian times, when perfumes were highly valuable and only available to kings and queens of the time. They were also cherished as a medical preparation as they knew perfume oils to cure headaches and lift one\u2019s mood.",
      "With NINU you can already costumise fragrances to your likes. In the future new fragrance sets will emerge even more tailored to your needs as you will be able to contribute and co-create new fragrance trends.",
      "We are a bunch of perfume and innovation enthusiasts, with serious business and entrepreneurship background. We love getting up every day and improving NINU!",
      "The core team stared the project are Marko Matijevi\u0107 and Simon Mohorovi\u010d. We are guiding and overlooking the whole project with our professional experience and also a formal business degree.",

The packages are going to be delivered to your door customs cleared and VAT included. We'll do our best to do the same for backers in other locations, but customs rules are specific for each country. To save on the platform fees and marketing partners\u2019 commissions, the shipping will be charged via post-campaign management survey when the rewards are ready to be delivered. Our best estimates for shipping costs for this campaign, based on current average prices for products of similar size and weight, are shown in the table below. At the delivery time, we\u2019ll look for available lowest-cost shipping options and offer such options to you. And we\u2019ll make the delivery process as precise and clear as possible, without any unforeseen changes or unexpected charges. Please note: some addresses, such as non-US P.O. boxes and locations considered \"remote areas\" by shippers like DHL, FedEx, or UPS, may require a higher shipping cost than the standard rate for the given country. In these rare cases, we may ask backers to either change the destination or cover the extra cost. Also, most of major post carriers, including USPS, UPS and Yun Express, keep the tracking history for only 60 to 120 days from the date of mailing and afterwards it\u2019s deleted or becomes unavailable. When the reward is shipped, the name of a post carrier and a tracking number are automatically emailed to the backer and added to his / her pledge management survey. Please, track your packages and inform us if any delivery issues arise. Any claims of shipped but undelivered rewards should be sent within 45 days from the date of mailing so we would have enough time to fix the issue while the shipping history is still available. Unfortunately, we can\u2019t take responsibility for any lost packages after that time.",

      "Risks and challenges",
      "No project is risk-free, and as with most projects, our biggest risk is timing. We\u2019re confident about our estimated ship date, but unforeseen events can and do happen. While we can\u2019t always change our circumstances, we can and will promise to communicate transparently and frequently with you every step of the way. We also wanted to bring to your attention that any creative process requires some improvements, changes, or corrections as you go. Delivering the flawless final product might require slightly changing specifications, colors, or overall design of 4D pouches, the 4D Vault or the air pump. Please not: the pumps are not manufactured by us and while we'll replace any faulty unit, we wouldn't be able to offer a full warranty that we are offering for the 4D products. Also, each step in this journey might take slightly more time than anticipated. Another thing outside of our control is shipping. The shipping costs are on the rise and final prices might differ from the estimates outlined on our campaign page. Nevertheless, we'll try to optimize the costs and charge the bare minimum.",

      "Thank you everyone for a hugely successful Indiegogo campaign. AmbaSat-1 is now over 200% funded and so far we've filled TWO rockets with AmbaSat-1 Satellites! The project has gained a fantastic amount of interest, so much so that we decided to create a company and open a dedicated AmbaSat Space Satellite shop.",
      "If you would like to join our mission and build your very own Space satellite, please head on over to our dedicated shop to purchase your satellite kit.",
      "AmbaSat Space Satellite Shop",
      "The Campaign",
      "AmbaSat-1 is a tiny Space satellite kit that you assemble and code yourself.",
      "Once your satellite kit is assembled and programmed, it will be launched on-board a commercial rocket into Low Earth Orbit, where it will spend up to 3 months in space.",
      "AmbaSat-1 uses LoRaWAN and The Things Network to send live data back to Earth. No special radio equipment is needed, you can view your satellite's data via the internet.",
      "It\u2019s your very own satellite in Space and we need your help to make it happen",
      "The AmbaSat-1 Spacecraft",
      "AmbaSats are just a little bigger than the size of a couple of postage stamps but have solar cells, a LoRaWAN radio transceiver, microcontroller (an Arduino compatible ATMEGA 328P-AU), memory, a gyroscope, accelerometer, magnetometer as well as a range of other sensor options. Making use of The Things Network (TTN), AmbaSats are capable of transmitting data to over five thousand Earth-based TTN receivers (Gateways) which are spread around the whole globe. No specialist radio receiving equipment is required, your data appears over the internet directly to your AmbaSat Dashboard (see full details later).",
      "The Rocket Launch",
      "How will my satellite get into space?",
      "If you choose the rocket launch option (see below), your AmbaSat-1 satellite will travel into space inside a CubeSat. This is a small \u201c3U\u201d container measuring 10cm x 10cm x 32cm. The CubeSat is secured inside the payload area of the launch rocket and contains spring-loaded stacks of up to 200 AmbaSat-1 satellites. On reaching Low Earth Orbit (about 250km above Earth), a radio transmission will be sent from our ground station with the command to release the AmbaSats into space, where they will become free-flying spacecraft. Your satellite will then power itself using its bank of solar cells and you will start to receive data to your AmbaSat Dashboard (see later). Congratulations, you now belong to a very exclusive group of makers! You have your very own satellite, live in Space and sending data back to Earth over a network of 5000+ Things Network (TTN) \"ground stations\".",
      "Which rocket company will launch my satellite?",
      "We\u2019ve chosen Interorbital Systems as our rocket launch partner. Interorbital Systems (IOS) is a rocket, satellite and spacecraft manufacturing company and they also provide a full launch-service for third-parties. Their innovative modular launch vehicle, the NEPTUNE, will provide your AmbaSat with the world's lowest-cost access to space. Interorbital Systems deliver reliable and affordable space-launch solutions.",
      "What are my basic Pledge/product options?",
      "We've created a wide range of pledge options to meet your budget and goals but the two main differences are battery or solar power.",
      "You can also choose to build your spacecraft first and then add on a rocket launch at a later date.",
      "1. AmbaSat-1 Kit - battery power",
      "This is the base option. If you're interested in building a satellite but don't have the budget or need for a full rocket launch then this is the one for you. Battery powered AmbaSat-1 satellites work just as well on Earth as they do in space and will connect to any Things Network (TTN) Gateway - there are over five thousand of these available around the globe. Choose this option if you'd like to build a kit and use it on Earth. 2 x AA batteries are all that's needed to power your Earth-based satellite for 2 years.",
      "2. AmbaSat-1 Kit - solar",
      "This is very similar to the base option above, except it comes with solar power cells instead of being powered by batteries. Choose this option if you'd like your satellite to be solar powered. The solar cells add additional cost but with the advantage that if you decide later that you'd like to launch your satellite into space then you already have the required package. All you need to do is book your slot on the next available rocket launch.",
      "The remaining options available cover pre-assembled satellites and whether you would like your satellite to be Earth-based or want to go for the full rocket launch into space.",
      "All satellite options which include the full rocket launch are solar powered. No batteries in space!",
      "Your Mission (Building your spacecraft)",
      "Your mission is split up into several stages. Once you receive your AmbaSat kit, it\u2019s time to start assembling the parts. If you\u2019ve chosen the full-build kit option, you will receive the AmbaSat Printed Circuit Board (PCB), microcontroller unit, kit of components, solar cells (or battery holder), etc. Now you can start assembling all the component parts onto the mainboard. If you\u2019re new to hardware and software, there is a backer option available which contains a full kit of tools to get you started, including soldering iron, multi-meter, wire cutters, etc.",
      "If you\u2019ve chosen the pre-assembled kit, then your satellite comes with all components pre-soldered onto the PCB. In that case you can move straight on to coding your satellite (see below). Your kit also comes with all the sample source code and instructions to get your satellite up and running.",
      "Coding",
      "Once you have a fully assembled AmbaSat-1, it\u2019s time to break out your coding skills. Don\u2019t worry though, if you\u2019ve never coded before, we\u2019ve included a full step-by-step guide on how to program your satellite. Also included is full example source code plus a range of different code templates which you can copy and modify so that you can get your satellite up and running quickly and doing exactly what you want it to do. See the Coding section below for full details.",
      "After assembling and coding your satellite, it\u2019s time to test that everything is working. In order to test your completed satellite, you will need to sign-in to your AmbaSat Dashboard. This is where you will see all kinds of data related to your spacecraft, including things like launch date, rocket type and specification, maps and spacecraft tracking details, etc. From the Dashboard you can view and test your satellite\u2019s connectivity with the TTN network. See the AmbaSat Dashboard section below for full details.",
      "After testing and tweaking is complete, you are READY FOR LAUNCH! But wait!",
      "Pre-launch testing",
      "Two months before launch date, you will need to return your completed and tested spacecraft back to our labs where it will undergo extensive pre-launch testing. We will perform compliance tests to make sure that your satellite conforms to space flight requirements, followed by a two-week soak-test to make sure all of your hard work can stand up to prolonged space flight. Finally, we will carry out a full vibration test before shipping to the cleanroom labs at Interorbital Systems where your satellite will be mounted into a deployer CubeSat. Once all satellites are mounted into the CubeSat, this will be loaded into the rocket\u2019s NEPTUNE payload capsule ready for launch.",
      "Launch Day!",

      "Who Are AmbaSat?",
      "The people behind AmbaSat are a bunch of technology, software, hardware and environmental geeks who love technology and the environment. About two years ago AmbaSense was created by a team of three co-founders, Martin Platt, Marcel Houtveen and Daniel Hopwood who boast 30 years\u2019 experience in the environmental health and IT industries. Twelve months ago they created the AmbaSat brand to encapsulate their satellite work and apply their business and technology knowledge to this new space venture. The team expanded to include several new faces and skills, including Wannapa Siripong, Environmental Chief, and John Chipp, hardware design expert.",
      "Martin Platt, co-founder and CEO at AmbaSat comments:",
      "\u201cFor the past three years we\u2019ve delivered thousands of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors to the food and social care industries through our AmbaSense Tiaki brand. During the journey we learned a lot about the business of delivering successful hardware and software and wanted to apply our knowledge and expertise to a very different field but one with a very similar set of fundamental technology requirements.\u201d",
      "\u201cAll our technology is designed and developed in-house, this includes the hardware, PCBs, Web Dashboards, server code, etc and all the business bits in between. We are passionate about the environment and through our sensor work have studied the impact human beings are having on our planet. We want to widen the study capabilities, both for Earth and beyond and empower users to solve complex problems with their own environmental challenges and solutions. Educational establishments, students, individuals and MAKERS now have this new tool at their fingertips. The AmbaSat satellite build is also a lot of fun!\u201d",
      "\u201cJust imagine if you could build your very own spacecraft and have it launched into Low Earth Orbit, for little more than the cost of a PlayStation\u201d",

      "Thank you for helping us take this campaign through the finish line \u2013 what a success! If you've already backed the Haven, we're working hard to build your boats and get them shipped to you before paddling season. If you haven't ordered yours yet, the Haven is still available at a discounted rate here on Indiegogo AND on Orukayak.com for those interested in financing their boat purchase for only $999 upfront.  Thank you again, talk soon, and we love you all!",
      "For years, we\u2019ve been asked the same question \u2013 \u201cDo you make a tandem kayak?\u201d We\u2019d redirect the question and give our pitch on the beauty and freedom that comes with paddling solo. After all, our single-seater models, the Beach LT, Bay ST, and Coast XT, have been designed and meticulously refined over the last six years to deliver the most liberating kayaking experience a paddler could dream up.",
      "But over the last couple of years, our own families started to grow. Our parents, partners, kids, and friends wanted to come along when we went kayaking.  This shifted our perspective and we heard the call of the community with fresh ears. \u201cWhen are you making a two-seater?\u201d Well, the wait is over \u2013 the answer is now.",
      "Our designers combined the ancient art of origami with everything they\u2019ve learned from the past six years of designing foldable kayaks. The result is a tandem kayak with unmatched performance and portability.  It's also our most versatile model ever \u2013 the Haven easily converts to a single-seater kayak with the switch of a few buckles, for those times when you just want to fly solo for a bit. And the integrated rail system lets you add a ton of accessories for fishing, photography, picnics, or whatever else floats your boat.",
      "Like all our kayaks, the Haven uses origami to fold up into a box small enough for car trunks or closets. At 40 pounds, it's half the weight of a typical tandem kayak\u2014 save your back for some paddling! Don\u2019t have a garage? Who cares! Tuck the Haven into your closet, under your bed, or any nook that suits your fancy. Don\u2019t have a roof rack on your car? Don\u2019t even own a car? Who needs one! Put it in the trunk of a Lyft, bring it on public transit, or the sidecar of a motorbike. Zoom zoom.",
      "It should be noted that the Haven is just slightly too big to fit in our existing Oru Pack. We\u2019re working on redesigning the pack, but in the meantime, we\u2019ve designed a strap and handles for the boat that allows two people to comfortably carry the Haven. And all of the components of the kayak tuck into the folds when it\u2019s boxed up, so you\u2019ll have your whole other hand free for carrying.",
      "All of our kayaks are made from a custom extruded polymer that is rated to 20,000 folds. The material is a thicker version of the same plastic that postal service bins are made out of \u2013 and those things take a beating. While we recommend treating your Oru like a fiberglass boat, these boats are scootable and draggable and bump-proof.",
      "Also, the two floorboards provide the boat with extra protection.  Hooking together from the top and bottom, the two floorboards create a protective case for the Haven. The boat also holds up well in extremely cute situations.",
      "The Haven combines the stability and quick set-up of our Beach LT with the performance and speed of the Coast XT. This boat, like all of our kayaks, uses origami to deliver incredible tracking and stability\u2014 the hull folds create hard chines and a long keel line. The lightweight materials make handling easy and responsive across all of our models. Plus, the double-man/woman power of the tandem allows the Haven to really move.",
      "We call it a tandem, but it's really much more than that. Feel like paddling solo? Switch a few buckles and bump the seat forward, and you've got yourself a high performing solo kayak. Consider your commitment issues enabled. Same boat, two ways to paddle",

      "Even though this boat has added components and space for a whole other person, we knew we had to keep the assembly quick and easy \u2013 if not the easiest. Chances are you\u2019ll be setting up the Haven with kids or pets running around, friends trying to toss you a beer, or as you\u2019re racing to catch the sunrise. Our designers utilized the intuitive closure system of the Beach LT, and added colored cues to the stitching and g-hooks so you know which strap goes where at first glance. Printed icons and instructions on the floorboards also make setup a breeze.",

      "Don\u2019t take our word for it. Hear from the paddlers who have tested the Haven.\n\n\"I love the new Haven and so does my pup! When it's just the two of us she gets the whole front of the kayak to stand and sniff the air. The Haven has enough room that we can bring along another person, a tent and some gear for an overnight at our favorite paddle-in campsite!\" - Jess A,",
      "\"The Haven was incredibly fun and stable- The additional weight of having a friend on board just made it easier to navigate and a wonderful shared experience. It folds up compactly and would fit perfectly in my small VW Bug. - Jacqueline",
      "\"The design is simple and felt sturdy and roomy for two people with a dog. It was intuitive to put together on the first assembly.  I felt really comfortable in the Haven for my first ever kayaking experience.\" - Jasmine,",
      "\"I found the Haven to be quick and easy to setup, particularly  with experience on the Beach and BayST models. Seating is adaptable and the kayak is very stable, even in rolling waves that are beginning to break. My dog Whiskey appreciated having room to spread out and he enjoyed the ride. The kids really liked it too- enough to try the stunt of standing up in the kayak, and everyone stayed dry!\" - Scott",
      "We designed the Haven because it\u2019s more fun to paddle together. It\u2019s also more fun to build things together!  After months of engineering, problem-solving, prototyping, and beta testing, we finally have the design complete. And the result is beautiful if we do say so ourselves. With your backing, we\u2019ll be able to purchase the dies, molds, materials, and factory equipment required to mass produce this product. It\u2019s time to get the Haven into your hands and out onto the water.",

In response, we designed a hub-motor drivetrain and board design that is easier to push and pump than any electric skateboard you've tried, period.",
      "How does it work?\nWe started with a brushless motor design which, unlike most electric boards, uses NO belts or gears that slow you down.  We spent over a year developing and refining our system, which dramatically reduces the drag and friction found in most brushless motor designs. For a crucial final touch we partnered with Bustin Boards to create an ultra-light, ultra-low, ultra-skate-friendly board and setup to make this the easiest electric board you'll ever push whether the power is on or off.",

      "\u201cI have been skating longer than electric boards have been a thing but it\u2019s always been a concept that fascinated me. The dream of effortlessly coasting back up to the top of the run on the same board you ripped down it always seemed like the perfect way to maximize your actual skate time. As E-Boards have quickly become a thing in today\u2019s market, no boards until the Dualomo quite met the qualifications demanded by my self and other real skaters out there. Finally, we now have a fully functional skateboard that can double as a commute crushing machine.\u201d\nJosh - Apex, NC",
      "\u201cI definitely had a blast with the hybrid board. I loved its ability to shoot quickly up hills and just its over all speed was awesome. The fact that it can be used as a traditional longboard is sick!\u201d\nRiley - Greencastle PA",
      "\u201cAs a guy in my mid 40\u2019s, I had the opportunity to test the new Dualomo Hybrid recently.  I\u2019m a longtime supporter of the longboard culture but given work, family and lots of other competing interests have never found the time to ride much.  The new board instantly captured my attention.  The ride was smooth, effortless and incredibly intuitive.  With other electric rides that I\u2019ve tested, the motor noticeably slowed downhill cruising.  This board is like riding a non-powered setup down the hills in my hometown.  I can definitely see using this for years to come, both as a weekend ride and even a daily commuter for my trip to work.\u201d \nKris - Park City, UT",
      "\"I had a bunch of longboards in high school and college but, at 23, I thought I had outgrown the stage.  The Dualomo brought back everything I loved about longboarding and more.  Thanks for letting me demo the board and I'll definitely be picking one up to ride to work!\"\nMeghan - Mclean, VA",
      "\"I didn't know what to expect from an electric board after being a traditional skateboarder my whole life.  Honestly its much more fun that I ever expected.  It reminds of snowboarding, skating and surfer all rolled into one.  The quality of everything was great and the power was tremendous, even up hill.\"\nMike - Hagerstown, MD",
      "\"I've been skating since the 1970's and have seen a lot of changes in the industry.  By far, the most exciting is the evolution to an electric-power board that I can ride downhill, push on flat ground, as well as glide up hills!  When I'm on the Dualomo, I feel like I'm surfing an endless wave.  Carving turns down hills, pushing through town, or ripping up inclines give the same feelings of freedom that caused me to fall in love with skateboarding!  There are many options out there for electric boards, but the way that the Dualomo carves is second to none.  I recommend this board to anyone, from beginners to those riding for years.\"\nJohn - Vienna, VA",
      "When does my board deliver?\nAs many of our you have heard we've made great strides on our manufacturing and are now shipping in January 2019.  We are aware that some of the perk items still read \"March 2019\".  This is because we CANNOT alter the written details of products that have already been purchased.  REST ASSURED, that we are aiming to ship ALL boards ordered through the campaign in January!",
      "Why did you make it?\nAs riders, we've watched as the race towards tech has over-shadowed a clear lack of functional design in every new electric board to hit the market.  Like all skaters, snowboarders and surfers, we have dreamt of the perpetual concrete wave.  We were excited about the innovations we saw with electric boards, but every new option to hit the market left us bored time after time.  Before long all of the brand-name, expensive boards we thought we'd love ended up unused, piled in the back of our garage.",
      "It was then that we realized that it was our calling to make a GREAT electric board that skated like a GREAT skateboard or longboard.  Two years later, here we are and we could not be more proud and excited to bring the Dualomo Hybrid to all of you!",
      "I see you have 3 models, which is the right one for me?\nThis is a question we are getting a lot and its kind of hard to answer.  Some of it depends on your budget and some of depends on your needs for speed/range.  Like all inventors, we started out aiming for the moon and wanted to produce a board with better specs than our competition.  After about 10 prototypes and thousands of tests and tweaks, we achieved that with the Hybrid-X.  However, soon after we unveiled pricing to our social media followers, we heard from many of you that you wanted an economical version.  Some of you said you just actually didn't WANT to go 25mph (a reasonable opinion, especially for beginners and young riders).",
      "In response, we managed to pair back the technology and save quite a bit of cost in doing so.  This gave us the ability to offer lower-cost, slower-speed models that are built with the same components and technology as our top board, the Hybrid-X.",
      "Do all three models use the same board?\nYES, all three models (Hybrid-E, Hybrid-S and Hybrid-X) use the exact same board from Bustin Boards, a custom 35\" Sportster board made with Bustin's signature ThermoGlass\u2122 and (E)Core\u2122 construction.",
      "Do all three models use the same components?\nAlmost.  All three boards use genuine Paris\u2122 Trucks and Five-O\u2122 wheels.  The Hybrid-X and Hybrid-S both use Bustin CERAMIC bearings, while the Hybrid-E uses Bustin Abec-9 bearings.",
      "Does the board use a controller like other electric skateboards?\nYes it does.  We designed the controller with a familiar feel for all of you e-skaters, but made it small enough to stash in your pocket when you're pushing the board manually.  Most likely you'll keep it in hand as you develop your PUSH/POWER rhythm of your hybrid skate.  The controller has two speed settings and also comes with a nifty wrist strap so you don't drop it.",
      "Do I have to be an experienced skateboarder or longboarder to ride it?\nAbsolutely not.  Most people are surprised to hear that its easier to learn on an electric skateboard than on a regular one.  Use the kids/beginner setting to learn how to keep your balance and carve.  As you get more comfortable, start practicing your push and before you know it you'll be ready to hit the skate park (well maybe not that quite yet).  Whether you're a seasoned pro looking to get less sweaty on your long commutes or a brand newbie who's never set foot on a skateboard, we promise that you can learn how to ride this board!",
      "What\u2019s the deal with the PUSH feature?  How does that work exactly?\nUnlike other electric skateboards, the Dualomo Hybrid allows for a more natural manual push (with your legs and feet that is) whether the board is turned OFF or ON.  This makes it 1000% more like a normal skateboard or longboard;  and less like one of those people mover belts at airports.",
      "We appreciate the Push-Function most when we're starting our rides.  Simply drop your board and push away just like you would on your skateboard or longboard.  All of the curious folks around you won't realize its an electric board until you decide to push the throttle and accelerate out of sight (They'll be scratching their heads wondering how you did that all day)!",
      "The Push-Function is also GREAT for conserving battery life.  Taking a slow detour through the park where it is mostly flat ground, people-weaving-type skating?  Thats a great place to get some pushes in and find the ole' skate rhythm as you duck and weave curious pedestrians.  The more you push, the longer that battery will last so don't be shy.   And of course, if your battery ever does die, you'll be able to push home :)",
      "How exactly does the push-friendly hub-motor work?\nFirst of all, we use a brushless hub-motor design that DOES NOT use belts or gears like most electric boards.  Boards that use gears are belts have a much harder time pushing freely.  Doing so is essentially like winding a huge clock or manually turning the engine in your car.  To make one part move, you must also extend that power through a series of gears and/or belts to make other parts move.",
      "Within the world of hub-motors, which use no belts or gears, there is a still a range of resistance that exists.  Some hub-motors won't turn at all without a power currency running through them.  Ours, on the other hand, is specially tuned to spin with less resistance whether the board is turned OFF or ON.  Because a hub-motor works using magnets, it is impossible to remove ALL resistance from the wheel, but we've pulled out every stop to create a motor that minimizes this resistance to the point where the board can be easily pushed like a regular skateboard.",
      "One obvious, but notable point here is that the board itself is naturally a bit heavier than a standard longboard because of the battery, motor, circuit board and cover.  We've done our best to make the board one of the lightest electric boards on the market, but it's not realistic to compare it to a board WITHOUT the electric compenents.  In other words, if you have a traditional Bustin Sportster and you're expecting this one to feel exactly the same, you might be disappointed.  Just as if you took a Porsche 911 and compared it to the same 911 towing one of those awesome little pop-up campers things.  It's still a great ride, but remember you're now towing some extra weight to get the power you need.",
      "How is the deck itself designed to be more push-friendly?\nBustin Boards designed this modified version of their Sportster Board specifically to compliment Dualomo's push-friendly design.  One of the things that makes the board easier to push is the design of the deck, which offers an ultra low double-dropped platform.  The original Sportster design was created as a pure PUSH/FREERIDE design, meaning that the deck is made to push and carve hard.  To allow for such a low board design we had a to make the battery and circuit boards ultra thin to provide enough clearance for every day skating.",
      "I dig it, how can I order my Dualomo Hybrid now?\nRight now only way to get the Dualomo Hybrid is to order through THIS Indiegogo campaign.  People who back this campaign will not only be the first in the world to own the Dualomo, but they'll also save of money off of the future retail price which will land somewhere around $1800 in stores.  To get your Dualomo Hybrid (now delivers in January 2019), here's what to do:\n         - Go to the RIGHT side of the project page and click BACK THIS PROJECT.\n         - Select the PERK package you want and order through the secure Indiegogo checkout page.\n         - And just like that, you have become one of the first people in the world to own the Dualomo Hybrid board.  We'll keep you updated via email and the updates section of the campaign.  For exact dates, please take a look at the Timeline just above this section ^.",
      "How much maintenance does the Dualomo Hybrid board, battery and motor require?\nBasically none.  We ask that you FULLY CHARGE the battery when you receive the board.  Beyond, just keep it out from under the wheels of dump trucks and try not to drop it out of your helicopter.  Obviously there are more than a few ways to destroy a skateboard, but we've designed the Dualomo Hybrid to stand up to most forms of normal wear and tear without needing much maintainance at all.",
      "How can I buy accessories such as extra wheels, replacement controllers, etc?\nAfter the campaign ends we\u2019ll be launching our online store www.dualomo.com where you can buy spare parts and accessories for the Dualomo Hybrid.",
      "Will the charger work with 120V and 220V outlets around the world?\nWe are creating the board using a variety of a voltage adapters.  You will receive the charger that works in your specific country based on where your board is shipping to.",
      "The board is really expensive, but the Indiegogo deal is awesome.  Please explain?\nWe believe our board exceeds the quality of any other board on the planet, but we know we are a small company building our dream from humble roots.  This Indiegogo campaign is the very first launch of a project we've been working on for more than 2 years.  We NEED community support to fund full-scale production so that we can compete with the big dogs.  To do that, we're offering our supporters our break-even price so that we can cover the cost of the boards and production setup.  After the campaign our normal price will be more in-line with most of the top brands in the industry.  That makes now a good time to help us help you :)",
      "Can I order the Dualomo Hybrid even though I do not live in the USA?  \nYes, for sure!  We ship worldwide for a flat-rate price of $75.  Shipping within the USA is $35.",
      "Is the Dualomo Hybrid delivered assembled and ready to ride?\nYes, for sure.  Your board will be delivered fully assembled and ready to rip.  All that we ask is that you FULLY charge the battery before riding.  This assures for a long, happy life for your battery.",
      "How much weight can the Dualomo Hybrid handle?  \nWe've tested the board up to 300 lbs with no problems.  However, please bear in mind that the speed and battery range are affected by both rider weight and terrain conditions.  If you are a heavy rider, your speed and range results may be a bit lower than someone who is smaller.  It doesn't make it less fun, but that's something you need to know if you're one of the great danes reading this.",
      "I live in the suburbs, is the Dualomo Hybrid a good choice for me?  Or is it only good for hipster city dwellers?\nYes, of course.  Well, let's rephrase that as \"probably heck yeah!\"  We designed the Dualomo Hybrid to surf the landscape whether you live in a suburban American neighborhood or in a downtown Hong Kong high-rise.  This board WILL change your life and make your car less important in most cases.",
      "The key question is \"how many of the things you do are within ~7 miles of your home?\".  With a battery range of ~15 miles, the Dualomo Hybrid-X will get you there and back with no problem.  Throw your charger in your backpack and you can also charge it on the move; like while grabbing a snack at your local coffee shop or in your friend Johnny's mom's kitchen.  She'll definitely think you're Johnny's coolest friend.",
      "Does the Dualomo Hybrid come in different sizes?  \nNope, this is one size fits all.  One of the reason's why Bustin Boards suggest that we use a modified version of their Sportster Board is due its accommodating size.  Although the full board comes in at a very stashable 35\", the wheelbase is long at almost 30\".  That means this a rather compact board that works great for ANY size rider.  Big feet?  Small feet?  No problem, the Dualomo Hybrid will perform great no matter what size you are.",
      "In related news, the compact nature of the 35\" Dualomo Hybrid also makes it great for stashing under your desk at school or in the trunk of your car.  It also carries easily in a skateboard-strap-equipped backpack.",
      "Is the Dualomo Hybrid waterproof?\nA better word would probably be water resistant.  If you ride it in the rain or want to spray it off with a hose, you will be fine.  If you accidentally launch it into the Hudson River and manage to retrieve it, you may need to replace the circuit board.  We salute you for jumping in after it and we'll help get you that new circuit board.",
      "Is the battery removeable?\nWe've designed our battery/circuitry cover to be easily removeable for any repairs or DIY upgrades people want to add (note that any DIY upgrades DO void the warranty, sorry tech nerds,  but you know thats normal :).  However, this board does not include a quick-swap battery design.  This would be a cool update on future versions, but our focus on this initial launch was on the PUSH/PUMP friendly elements.  IF you have any issues with your battery, we will most definitely be here to walk you through removing the casing and replacing it.",
      "Can I ride the Dualomo Hybrid if the battery dies?\nYes, yes and yes.  This is one of the coolest benefits of the Push-Friendly design.  No more will you be 'that guy' walking through the crowd because your riding lawnmower excuse for a skateboard died.",
      "What kind of warranty do you offer on the Dualomo Hybrid?\nAll boards come with a 1 year limited manufacturers warranty.  Should you encounter some production related manufacturer\u2019s defect during this time, we will take care of it according to our warranty.  As some elements of a board can be damaged due to certain types of riding and or crashes and accidents, we reserve the right to examine each warranty claim individually.  In other words, if you experience problems with your battery we\u2019ll gladly replace it and get you riding again fast and easy.  If you\u2019re board gets run over by a cross-town bus, the best we can offer you is a 30% off replacement deal.   We're fair and approachable;  and we're committed to supporting all of you who are helping us get this product off the ground.",
      "How much does shipping cost?\nIf you live in the US, shipping is just $25.  Outside of the USA, we're offering worldwide shipping at just $75.  In most cases we will be shipping using FedEx\u2122, but we reserve the right to ship via another carrier if needed based on your specific country.  Also please note that the customer is responsible for any import taxes imposed by your specific country.",
      "I live in New York!  Can I pick it up myself?\nUnfortunately the answer is probably no.  We're going to be doing the assembly and shipments outside of the city, but we have not chosen an exact location.  For now we're planning to ship all product directly from our assembly warehouse to customers.  We MAY offer a pickup address in NYC to consolidate and connect all of our New York fam with their new boards, but that is yet to be determined.  Backers will be the first to know!",
      "Are you going to have demo rides?\nOur designs, tooling and production are taking place all over the country from New York to Pennsylvania to Florida to California.  To get it all done and DONE WELL, we'll be hopping around the country a lot during the next 5 months while we finalize production of the Dualomo\u2122 Hybrid.",
      "Along the way we'll be connecting with riders and doing Test Rides.   If you live in one of the USA and are jonesin' to ride the Dualomo Hybrid, keep a keen eye on our social media, especially our Instagram Stories.  If you see that we're coming to a town near you, shoot us a DM and we'll do our best to make it happen!",
      "With two years of development and refinement, most of the heavy lifting is behind us.  All materials are sourced and ready to deliver for production of the motors, circuit boards and batteries.  With 17 years of experience producing the boards and components, we also don't expect any delays on the Bustin Boards side (learn more about Bustin Boards' History >>).",
      "With that said, no project is ever completed without a few hiccups.  With an experienced, qualified team on all sides of this collaboration we will approach all challenges head on and maintain clear, open communication with our backers throughout the process.  We're realistic and we're honest about our approach to this project.  We're committed to being upfront with our backers about any and all updates.",

It is a highly engineered piece of equipment that needs to be used appropriately and cared for. There are potentially life-threatening risks associated with using the SCORKL, and breathing underwater, that you need to be aware of and take steps to avoid.",
      "Risks and challenges\nThe SCORKL and ELECTRIC COMPRESSOR require high-precision manufacturing and high-quality materials since they both operate with air stored at high pressures. The BATTERY PACK is a power converter that requires a number of electronic parts, including safety switches, as well as cooling mechanisms. All components have already been manufactured to high quality during sample runs.",
      "The primary risk is production delays. Coordinating with an overseas factory and maintaining quality throughout every step is a challenge. Fulfilment and shipping becomes a hurdle when dealing with thousands of orders. We will not rush through these steps and will tackle them carefully, one by one. We will take SCORKL 2.0 - Electric to the \"design for manufacturing\" step soon, and the target is to ship out units in December 2023.",
      "There is some risk that items will not come exactly as pictured, due to manufacturing considerations. The promised function will not be different, and any style changes if any will be iterative and non-significant to the original look and feel.",

      "The first social platform giving the vape community a voice to shape the industry.",
      "Short Summary",
      "The vape industry is a massive, passionate community, but it's fragmented. Vapers lack a dedicated space to connect and influence the brands they love, while shops and advocates struggle to be heard. Vape Shop Maps is the first-ever social and discovery platform built to unite the entire vapor ecosystem. We're not just creating an app; we're building a digital home for the industry, powered by the community itself.",
      "The core of our platform is already built and functional. Your support will help us raise $20,000 to expand our features, launch the mobile app, and give the vapor space a voice it's never had.",
      "What We Are Building",
      "Vape Shop Maps is the first platform to connect every part of the vapor industry\u2014from vapers and local shops to major brands and advocacy groups.",
      "For Vapers, It's a Voice:",
      "Influence the Market: Use our tools to tell your local store what products you want them to stock.",
      "Connect Your Community: A personalized social feed, direct messaging, reviews, and group chats keep you connected.",
      "Shape the Platform: Vapers get to vote on which new features get built next. No corporate gatekeepers\u2014just the community shaping its own digital home.",
      "Discover & Support: Find new brands and flavors, and follow your favorite local shops to support small businesses.",
      "For Businesses & Associations, It's a Bridge:",
      "Increase Visibility: Shops and brands can post updates, promote products, and build real relationships with their customers.",
      "Amplify Your Message: Associations can reach members and share important updates at scale.",
      "This isn't just a directory; it's a movement to give the industry a unified space to grow and lead.",
      "Our Story: Built from the Inside",
      "I didn't come from a tech firm; i came from the road. Starting out as a small wholesaler, driving shop-to-shop, helping owners educate staff, and even running the counter. Later i worked with brands and eventually focused on advocacy full-time, fighting for the people in this industry.",
      "Through it all, i saw the same cracks: too many shops, brands, and vapers go unheard because their conversations are scattered across platforms that weren't built for them. Vape Shop Maps was born from that experience to fill one critical need: to give the industry visibility, connection, and a place to belong.",
      "Where Your Support Goes",
      "We have a functional platform and have already started onboarding small businesses, associations, wholesalers and more. This isn't just an idea; it's a project already in motion. The $20,000 we raise will go directly toward two key areas:",
      "Platform Development: Refining and expanding our website, optimizing for mobile, and building out the new rewards systems.",
      "Mobile App: Starting the process of building the full mobile app, which is scheduled to launch in September.",
      "Risks and How We'll Overcome Them",
      "We believe in full transparency and are prepared to meet every challenge head-on.",
      "Technical Development: Building a social platform is complex. Our Mitigation: The core structure of Vape Shop Maps is already built and functional. This funding allows us to refine and expand what already works.",
      "User Adoption: Getting a new community on board is always a hurdle.",
      "Our Plan: We are launching with a built-in network of vape shops and brands to help create momentum from day one.",
      "Reward Fulfillment: Supply chain coordination is key. Our Promise: We have already sourced a reliable supplier for our custom phone cases and will collect all necessary information after the campaign ends, providing clear communication and regular updates on delivery timelines.",
      "Industry Hurdles: The vapor industry faces ongoing regulatory scrutiny. Our Approach: Our platform is built to be community-first, adaptable, and compliant, with a focus on supporting the people behind the industry.",

    "allParagraphs": [
      "The ergonomics of a hardware looper with the power of Ableton Live. Looping with no boundaries.",
      "Please visit http://www.datalooperpedal.com for more info and to purchase!",
      "Say goodbye to generic MIDI controllers that you have to spend days programming. Say goodbye to hardware loop pedals with limited inputs and inferior sound quality. The DataLooper takes the ergonomic design of a hardware loop pedal and pairs it with the power of software looping using Ableton Live. Using only a single USB cable, it gives you all the controls and visual feedback you need to use 3 loopers without ever having to look at the screen.",
      "Using Ableton Live with a DataLooper pedal offers significant advantages over your traditional loop pedal. This system opens up a world of unlimited possibilities.",
      "Check out this video, featuring two DataLooper pedals synchronized via the Ableton Link protocol over WiFi. This demo showcases a combination of the Session Control mode and the Traditional Looper mode.",
      "The DataLooper is designed to do everything your traditional loop pedal does and more. Every button is configurable, but this is the default setup:",
      "You can use DataLooper as a traditional loop pedal with the Ableton Looper plugin, or record ideas efficiently and quickly with clips in the Ableton Session View. Here\u2019s an overview of both modes.",
      "Looper mode is designed to emulate a 3-track, traditional loop pedal. The software automatically detects tracks containing \u201cDL#\u201d in the track title and synchronizes the status LED\u2019s with the looper, so you can loop without looking at a screen. The master control buttons on the right most column allow you to stop, mute or clear all three loops at once.",
      "Datalooper also features a 'new session' mode. If you hold the clear button for one second, the metronome will turn off and the tempo will re-calculate based on the next loop you record. This allows you to fluidly move between pieces without having to listen to a click track. Best of all, Datalooper never stops the transport to change tempo, meaning you can linearly record your whole set and capture every loop and overdub in pristine quality.",
      "Session Control mode eliminates the need to MIDI map clip slots and gives you a hands-free workflow for rapidly creating clips on the fly. The software automatically detects tracks containing \u201cCL#\u201d in the track title and auto-scans for unused clip slots. The controls (record, stop, undo, clear) are then attached to that clip slot. When you are done with a clip, you can hold \"stop\" and advance to a new clip; allowing you to record a lot of ideas very quickly. Session control mode also allows you to work directly with MIDI Overdubs, meaning you can overdub onto MIDI clips without worrying about the session record button triggering every record armed track.",
      "DataLooper was designed to be large enough for comfortable button operation, but lightweight and small enough to fit on a pedalboard. It weighs less than 3 pounds and has the following dimensions:",
      "Size L x W x H:",
      "8.74 in x 5.75 in x 2.01 in\n(222 mm x 146 mm x 51 mm)",
      "DataLooper was born in 2016 after trying to integrate loop pedals into a band environment and getting frustrated with the hassle of synchronization. The software has been tweaked and the pedals have been road tested and refined over a number of iterations.",
      "DataLooper works by using the MIDI communication protocol with an ARM Cortex-M0+ based micro-controller. A custom Ableton Live Remote Script controls communication and synchronization between the DataLooper pedal and Ableton, making the DAW & pedal work seamlessly together.",
      "If the DataLooper is successfully funded, here's what the months following the Indiegogo campaign will look like.",
      "November 20 - January 1: Final Prototype and Bench Testing",
      "This period of time will allow for any final design changes based on community feedback and allow a final prototype to be created and fully tested.",
      "January 2 - End of February : Manufacture & Software Tweaking",
      "The first two months of 2019 will be dedicated to manufacturing the DataLoopers; assembling PCB's, coordinating with the machine shop to ensure perfect enclosures, etc. In tandem with the physical product development, the software aspect of the DataLooper will be fully tested and perfected.",
      "Early March : Shipping and Website",
      "At this point, DataLoopers should be ready to go and will be sent out to backers. To maintain communication with backers and other potential customers, a website with support, software downloads, etc. will be established for the DataLooper.",
      "Your financial support will enable me to offer the DataLooper at a more accessible price point and get it into the hands of musicians immediately. Although a small batch (10) of the pedals has already been created, the manufacturing costs associated with small runs makes it cost prohibitive to offer these pedals at a reasonable price. Successful funding of the Indiegogo campaign will enable me to pay the manufacturing fees for a higher number of pedals to be created at once, lowering the cost per unit to a reasonable price point. It will also aid in covering additional costs, such as FCC Certification and Provisional Patent application fees required in bringing a product to market. By supporting this project, you are also supporting the development of an open-source looper system. All of the DataLooper software will be released under the GNU General Public License; this means that anyone can use and modify the software to customize it for their needs.",

Whether it\u2019s an unexpected backlog or a quality assurance issue on the ground floor, we\u2019ll let you know immediately. Our #1 priority is product quality followed by timely delivery.",
      "FULFILLMENT: Sometimes, stuff happens that can\u2019t be planned for; a supplier misses a deadline, a package gets held up at customs, a shipment gets lost, or a global pandemic shuts down shipping ports around the world. Those things can cause delays. We\u2019ll keep open and honest communication with you through our process so you know where your product is and when it\u2019s going to get to you.",

The aqueduct delivers maximum hydration convenience while keeping your drinks cold super long in your Yeti or Hydro Flask! Less time stopping to deal with the hassle of bottles & backpacks = more time doing what you love most \u2764\ufe0f",
      "They leak in your backpack and are easy to puncture, get moldy, and can't keep your water cold for long.  Insulated bottles are awesome for keeping drinks cold and are more sanitary, but don't offer enough convenience for active adventurers.",
      "It's pretty slick.  The patent-pending system features a 2-in-1 lid, which allows two unique setup options.  It combines the best of your favorite bottle's insulation with the convenience of a tube  and bite valve.  The best part?  It's easy to clean.  That means the same setup can be easily cleaned so you can switch from sipping ice cold water to Gatorade to margaritas?without thinking twice.",
      "The aqueduct is designed for adventurers, by adventurers, and is perfect for on-the-go, long lasting cold hydration when convenience matters above all else: hiking, cycling, skiing, paddle boarding, rock climbing, or even parents juggling their kiddos (the struggle is real to get two free hands!).  To get started with your aqueduct, simply swap your factory lid for the aqueduct and choose your setup.",
      "The hydration tube passes through the lid with a 36\" tube on top of the lid, a premium locking bite valve and cap, all paired with a unique one-way valve nestled in the lid that allows air to enter the bottle as you drink (but liquid can't leak back out).",
      "Need a plain ole' bottle again after you're done? aqueduct has your back; the tube can be removed, revealing a convenient drinking access point which is sealed with the attached cap.",
      "For added flexibility, the tube and bite valve are fully compatible with other aqueduct lids.  So if you're a fan of Yeti, Hydro Flask, and Nalgene at the same time, you'll only need one tube setup.  However, you'll still need to purchase a discounted lid for each unique bottle since one lid size doesn't fit all bottles.",
      "The aqueduct can be easily cleaned in just a few minutes, including the bite valve assembly.  Just grab a hose brush, soapy water, and you'll be done in a snap.",
      "The aqueduct has been a labor of love over the last two years.  We've gone from sketches, to 3D designs, to messy 3D prints, to creating 3D prints from resin shown below!  Next step, FDA approved food safe BPA/BPS free injection molds ?",
      "We're now set to sail!  We've been in negotiations with manufacturing partners for many months prior to even launching crowdfunding.  We're hitting the ground running!",
      "For the abundance of clarity, the aqueduct is the lid and tube hydration system only. The aqueduct is designed as an accessory to your previously purchased bottle with the exception of perks that include a bottle explicitly, such as the aqueduct Pro Series.  aqueduct is in no way associated with Hydro Flask, Yeti, Nalgene, or any other bottle brand.

      "So she turned to Facebook groups\u2014where strangers offer donations with no health screening, no ID checks, no legal protection. She was ghosted. Lied to. Sent medical files that didn\u2019t match. Told she had to \u201ctrust\u201d someone who wouldn\u2019t show his face.",

      "Slim, Earth-friendly hangers with an innovative notch that eliminates the stretching of collars.",
      "The Mozu Hanger is a beautiful, slim, Earth-friendly hanger with an innovative notch that eliminates the stretching of collars. From baby outfits to adult shirts, the Mozu Hanger can revolutionize the way you hang your clothes.",
      "From button-down dress shirts and polo shirts to hoodies and t-shirts, the Mozu Hanger can easily be used on a wide variety of garments and allows you to hang and remove clothing easily without unbuttoning buttons or overstretching collars.",
      "The Mozu Hanger was designed with business professionals in mind. Whether you dry clean your clothes or you travel regularly, you know the pain of unbuttoning and buttoning shirts. With the Mozu Hanger, most button-down shirts can be put on and taken off without unbuttoning a single button.",
      "Parents know the frustration of having to buy baby hangers, kid hangers, and then regular hangers as their children grow. With the Mozu Hanger, we've eliminated the need for various sizes of hangers, and we've simplified the clothes hanging experience in the process.",
      "*Source: http://www.greenprogress.com/environment_articl...",
      "Our wheat straw hanger is light and thin while still being strong, flexible, and highly durable. The hanger is made from 40% renewable wheat straw material, an agricultural bi-product, making it a great alternative to conventional plastics.",
      "*Please note that the premium bamboo Mozu Hangers are no longer available",
      "Conventional plastic hangers are cheap and very flimsy, whereas the Mozu Hangers are strong and durable enough to last a lifetime.",
      "The design of the Mozu Hanger offers a variety of features to make your life easier, and it is so unique that we were awarded a US Patent.",
      "The Mozu Hanger is approximately 16.2\u201d long and 8.1\" tall, and is about 0.23\u2033 thick at the top and 0.17\u2033 thick at the bottom. The notch-to-shoulder length is about 6.875\u201d long.",
      "*Please note that the premium bamboo Mozu Hangers are no longer available",
      "Childhood friends Tim Lee and Michael Graham teamed up to pursue their lifelong dream of starting a design company together, which they named Ensu Design. They leveraged their backgrounds in design and engineering and set off to redesign everyday products by incorporating beautiful design, innovative functionality, and environmental consciousness. The Mozu Hanger is the first embodiment of their design philosophy.",
      "Timothy Lee \u2013 Engineer + Co-Creator",
      "After earning degrees in mechanical engineering from Columbia and the University of Washington, Tim spent several years in the aerospace and automotive industries as an engineer and fabricator. Now, he is a proud military spouse and stay-at-home dad by day and a technology consultant and product development engineer by night. He\u2019s passionate about innovation and holds five patents (additional pending), and he recently earned his EMBA from Quantic.",
      "Michael Graham \u2013 Designer + Co-Creator",
      "Since studying industrial and graphic design at the Art Institute, Michael has been a graphic designer and art director for several top media and marketing companies as well as for an international fine minerals dealer. He was also a topographic analyst in the United States Army, with two combat tours to Iraq. He is a proud father, and he is passionate about design.",
      "Although the Mozu Hanger was originally intended to be an internal test project and nothing more, its functionality and simplicity proved to be so inspiring that we decided to bring it to market.",
      "The problem statement was simple: plastic hangers are primarily made from petroleum, and they typically end up in landfills. Therefore, the first objective was to make the clothing hanger more sustainable. Through extensive research, bamboo and wheat straw were determined to be extremely promising materials. Bamboo is one of the most sustainable materials on the planet, and wheat straw is a strong and economical bioplastic that is made of 40% renewable content, making both materials ideal for an eco-friendly hanger.",
      "The second objective was to identify a problem with conventional clothing hangers and solve it. The problem we chose was the stretching of tight-necked shirts and collars. By incorporating a notch into the body of the hanger, shirts could be slid past the center-point and removed with ease. This simple but highly effective solution eliminates the stretching of collars and allows for the hanging and removal of most buttoned shirts, even with top buttons buttoned. The design of the notch is so effective that it works on baby clothes as well.",
      "Through refinement, prototypes, and evaluations, our design became what is now known as the Mozu Hanger, a beautifully designed, slim, eco-friendly hanger that revolutionizes the way you hang your clothes. \u201cMozu\u201d (pronounced moh-zoo) is a modification of the word \u201cMoso,\u201d which is the species of bamboo most commonly used for manufacturing. We are excited to introduce the patented Mozu Hanger, and we hope that everyone will appreciate its beauty, functionality, and sustainability as much as we do!",
      "Risks and challenges",
      "We have an overseas manufacturer lined up for production, and the injection molding tooling has already been made. Production samples in both wheat straw and bamboo have already been received and approved. As always, the project timeline is estimated. Any delays in production, shipping, customs, or fulfillment will shift the timeline to the right, which of course can result in delays. COVID-19 has had a significant global impact on both manufacturing and logistics, which we have done our best to account for in our estimates. Of course, we will continue to keep you posted as everything happens.",

      "Packed with connectivity options (Bluetooth 4.2 and WiFi), Zing can act as a visual indicator for incoming calls and other smartphone events.",

      "First and foremost, Zing is an energy-efficient LED night light with dusk-to-dawn light and motion sensors. Powered by 12 full-color RGB+White LEDs, each capable of over 4-billion colors and 512 levels of brightness, Zing can be as soft or as brilliant as you'd like. Individually addressable LED elements allow for a full-range of light effects, from a cozy camp fire to the mysterious northern lights.",
      "When motion is detected, Zing will gently power up to 40% intensity (configurable) via its bottom LEDs to help you navigate without blinding you. It will gradually return to standby levels after motion ceases.",
      "Zing's light features are fully customizable using the Zing app. Events and triggers can be assigned their own colors and effects.",
      "A traditional motion-triggered night light will only turn on when you move in front and in range of its sensor. Zing is much smarter.",
      "A pack of Zings will automatically learn and predict your entire path at night. Your midnight refrigerator run, your kid's trip to the bathroom, etc. Every Zing along your anticipated route will light up with a soft glow as soon as the first movement is detected. No more scary dark doorways and no need to reach for light switches.",
      "Zing does this automatically by observing and learning your movement patterns over the course of 7-10 days.",
      "In technical terms, each Zing continuously calculates the conditional probability of an imminent motion event from its own sensor inputs and those from its neighbors. When the predicted probability is high enough, Zing turns on. The entire process happens without the need for configuration and is self-correcting. If your night-time habits change, Zing will change with you.",
      "Better still, Zing does this securely and without servers. The predictions are made individually within each Zing and never leaves your house. No wifi connection is needed or required for this to work. Nothing outside your home needs to know your activities.",
      "Not only does Zing help you find your way in the dark, it can also help you find your stuff.",
      "Many modern gadgets emit Bluetooth Smart signals as part of their normal operation, including key trackers, fitness bands, smartwatches, even your phone. Zing Locator combines these signals into a real-time position of each item and makes their locations accessible via the Zing app or voice commands through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.",
      "Simply install a Zing in each room, configure the Zing Locator service, and effortlessly track all the gadgets in your house. Don't waste time looking for your tagged keys, wallet, purse, or smartphone in the morning. Find them in a snap with Zing.",
      "Zing Locator works with most Bluetooth Smart devices on the market today and supports device beeping with select brands.",

      "Zing is built with open technologies and can interface with many home automation platforms. We are committed to open and secure API access to all of Zing device capabilities. IFTTT users can expect rich integration with existing recipes. Set up Zing to work together with other smart home devices. Be visually notified when someone rings the Ring doorbell.

      "Our Story",
      "For fifteen years, the food and beverage industry was my life. I loved the energy, the creativity, and the community. But in 2015, a serious injury changed everything. I could no longer keep up with the long hours and physical demands, and I had to step away from the work that had been my passion.",
      "In 2020, I planned to start a catering company to stay connected to the industry. Then the pandemic hit. Like so many others, my plans were derailed. I watched as restaurants and bars across the country closed, not just from COVID, but because of long-standing challenges like staffing shortages and burnout. The people behind these businesses were some of the most talented chefs, bakers, and bartenders I knew, but they were left without a clear path forward.",
      "At the same time, it was obvious that the demand for great food and experiences had not gone away. People still wanted to hire skilled culinary creators, but the traditional systems were broken. There was no modern way for clients to find and hire them directly, and no real platform that respected the craft.",
      "That is why I created CulinaryFleet. It is a platform designed to help culinary talent connect with clients in a way that works for both sides. No outdated middlemen, no agencies, just a space where chefs, bakers, and bartenders can build their businesses and reach the people looking for their services.",
      "The core platform is nearly complete. The waitlist is growing. With your support, we can finish development and bring CulinaryFleet to life. Together, we can help rebuild this community and create new opportunities for the culinary world.",

      "If we do not reach the full goal, all funds raised will still be used to complete as much of the platform as possible and launch the core marketplace. The more we raise, the faster and more fully we can deliver.",
      "CulinaryFleet exists to solve a real problem. After working 15 years in the food and beverage industry, and seeing firsthand the effects of staffing shortages, burnout, and the challenges that small culinary businesses face, I knew something had to change. CulinaryFleet is designed to help chefs, bakers, bartenders, and culinary creators connect directly with clients  without outdated staffing agencies or middlemen",
      "As with any tech platform, there is always a risk of delays in development or adjustments after user feedback. That said, the core platform is already built, and I have a clear roadmap to completion. My background in the F&B industry and business management has prepared me to deliver this project with care and professionalism. We have strong demand already, with an active waitlist of chefs, bakers, bartenders, and clients, and we are committed to launching CulinaryFleet successfully.

      "Swappable media plates, standing desk and largest vertical range; Grandstand evolves your playing.",
      "Grandstand is a music stand system designed to fit the way you play.  This innovative music platform offers unmatched height range, interchangeable media plates, secure ways to hold a tablet or even laptop and a desk mode providing an instant standing desk. Grandstand\u2019s sleek, modern design and finely finished wood fits beautifully into your decor.",
      "You\u2019re proud to display your instrument, so why not your music stand? Music stands have always been plain and boring - we decided to raise the standard, with premium materials, finishes and patented features.",
      "Like a grand piano, Grandstand is beautiful and designed to be admired. It commands attention and will be by your side for years to come.  It is versatile, aesthetically pleasing, and oh-so practical.  This revolutionary platform offers maximum playing options, without sacrificing style.",
      "The system\u2019s Tabletop Base is always on hand whenever - or wherever - you need it.  You\u2019ll be setting up for impromptu performances quicker than ever before. Switch our versatile media plates from full standing height to tabletop with a single, satisfying click.",
      "The way we view sheet music has changed a lot over the last 100 years. Unfortunately, home music stands haven\u2019t kept up.  Musicians need more versatility than ever before. You need a stand that easily adjusts to your playing style.  A stand that can accommodate both traditional and modern media. For many of us, this meant owning and storing multiple music stands. Grandstand leads the way in modern music stands, with media plates that accommodate tablets and laptops in addition to the classic books, binders, and sheets.  All media can be displayed at any angle within seconds.",
      "Here at Noisy Clan we want more people playing more music. Last year we delivered Wee Stand, the world\u2019s lightest, ultra-portable music stand. Wee Stand\u2019s Campaign was a huge success and we raised over $300,000 in pledges and shipped stands to over 47 countries via Kickstarter and Indiegogo InDemand.",
      "Our campaign was incredibly rewarding and exciting, we experienced our fair share of challenges and learned a great deal along the way. This has led to a number of changes in how we will manufacture and deliver Grandstand. We are working with manufacturers located in both China and the UK as we strive to bring as much of the manufacturing and assembly as possible to the UK.",
      "We are committed to a top-notch customer experience. Communication is at the forefront of everything we do at Noisy Clan; our regular backer updates were crucial in our previous campaign. From launch to delivery, our weekly updates will keep you in the loop throughout the entire process.  We want you to love your Noisy Clan products. Our Noisy Clan will assist you every step of the way, so we are on hand to guide you through our 30 day money back guarantee should you need it.",
      "Since the reveal of Wee Stand our customers have been incredibly passionate about music and vocal about what they\u2019d like to see from music stands of the future. This real world insight was invaluable and the design of Grandstand addresses these shared pain points. Wee Stand tackled challenges faced by musicians outside the home. Grandstand solves issues for at home musicians and is a piece of furniture you\u2019ll be proud to display in your home.",
      "We received a wealth of customer suggestions and requests for features that we incorporated into GrandStand.",
      "One of Grandstand\u2019s core features is our Quick-Click swapping system. The unique centre clip allows you to change your media plate in seconds, adapting to your musical needs. You can swap from a traditional music stand setup to a specialised tablet holder with a simple, satisfying click.",
      "All of the plates that fit the elegant Grandstand base are also interchangeable with the Tabletop Base that is perfect for smaller spaces. Whether you are composing at your desk or video chatting with gran, this little wonder is always \u2018handy\u2019 to have around!",
      "This tripod boasts a double-telescoping system. The base features a friction mechanism for quick, \u2018instant gratification\u2019 adjustments, and a twist-lock mechanism for extended range adjustment. This dual approach means that Grandstand Tripod Base works equally well for a seated musician or a 6\u20195\u201d trombone player!",
      "Grandstand\u2019s Tabletop Base is always on hand whenever you need it. You\u2019ll be setting up for an impromptu performance quicker than you ever have before all while using the same media plates as the Tripod Base which can be swapped out with a single click. Turn your music stand into a tabletop stand, recipe book holder and more.",
      "This feature locks your media plate in a horizontal position for additional security when using laptops and other devices.",
      "Grandstand is designed to accommodate your preferred viewing angle.  Enabled by the Secure Clip, the unique over-vertical feature means that the plate can safely point downward. A useful feature, particularly during video calls or virtual lessons and performances.",
      "Grandstand is more than a music stand; it's a piece of music furniture designed to be displayed in your home. The sleek wooden finish on its legs and media plates turn a music stand into a lovely and useful addition to your space.",
      "Grandstand\u2019s tablet holder is made of sturdy, powder-coated steel. The cushy top layer and padded Secure Clip offer further protection for your valuable devices and there is a gap in the shelf to allow for easy charging. The tablet holder works in either portrait or landscape orientation.",
      "Grandstand easily adjusts from full standing height to a comfortable seated position with a simple pull of the central pole. Quickly adjust to the perfect height with our twist-lock range adjustment. Using the Grandstand System, you can go from 20cm in Tabletop Mode to 52cm (20.5in) in Seated Mode to 160cm (63 in) in Standing Mode. Now that's some range!",
      "Our interchangeable media plate systems allows you to click and swap from one media plate to another or from the Tabletop Base to the Tripod Base in seconds with a simple and satisfying click.  You can tilt it up to 90 degrees with our tilt and lock system.",
      "Quickly rotate your media plate 360\u00b0 on Grandstand's Tripod Base or 45\u00b0 on Tabletop Base without extra adjustments. Get to the fun part - PLAYING!",
      "Our strong, padded Secure Clips hold your tablet or laptop firmly, without fear of it flying off mid-performance. They also hold your device securely, without interfering with your view of the music.",
      "Grandstand Tripod and Tabletop Base have the ability to swap media plates with a simple and satisfying click means they can be used in a variety of ways.  Play seated, standing or at a desk. With our easy-to-use friction-based system AND twist and lock mechanism, all is possible. Make music your way - or use the system in many day-to-day life scenarios, such as Zoom calls and holding recipe books.",
      "Grandstand\u2019s Quick-Click mechanism, sturdy lock hinge, easy adjust pole, and Secure Clips were all designed to be accessible and user-friendly for our customers. Adjust your music stand to adapt to your playing environment or situation without fuss.",
      "Say goodbye to clunky, unattractive music stands that look out of place in your home. Grandstand\u2019s high-grade wood and superior finish ensure that it looks \"at home,\" no matter where it\u2019s placed.",
      "Grandstand's Tripod and Tabletop Base are both sturdy and designed to stay in place thanks to the design and weight of their base units. No more worrying about knocking over your music stand!",
      "Sheet music has changed a lot in the past 10 years we\u2019ve made a large shift to using tablets and laptops, so it\u2019s important our stands were designed with this in mind. All our media plates are equipped with easy to use secure clips which won\u2019t scratch or damage laptops or tablet screens.  Focus on playing instead of worrying about your devices",
      "Can't stop won't stop! Not seeing a plate perfect for your needs? We have many ideas in the pipeline and plan to produce additional plates to build on your Grandstand platform.  Future plans include conductor, trap stand and extra wide plates (for 5+ sheets side by side)! Plus,  media plates are easily replaceable in the event they are lost, stolen, or *insert strange ways we somehow break stuff* without having to replace your base.",
      "As we were working on Wee Stand we generated hundreds of ideas that we considered, rejected or agonised over. We obsessed on whether they would work for the most portable stand on the planet. Many of those ideas were great but would have compromised the design and performance of Wee Stand. As we focussed in on Wee Stand we kept the best concepts and ideas that weren\u2019t used in Wee Stand and banked them for a music stand that would work in the home and that was not focussed on versatility over portability.",

      "We wanted to follow up the success of Wee Stand with a stand that addressed home use.  We went back to the drawing board (ok maybe our CAD tools) and reimagined how a music stand might fit into the home.  Initially we considered how to make it stow away, but quickly realised that Wee Stand could do that and we wanted something more for the home.  The final design direction embraces being proud to leave your stand out in your home, making music more likely to happen on a daily basis.",
      "Like most incredible things in life, making music is best when it\u2019s done together. We want to collaborate with you to create more innovative music accessories.

      "Manufacturing: Due to ongoing travel, shipping, and logistic issues, we are diversifying our manufacturing. We are doing as much of the part manufacturing and assembly locally (in the UK) as possible. We have been quoting the project to a number of UK suppliers to find a group that we can work with. We have built multiple rounds of prototypes and have identified the better vendors through our journey. This means we will be able to easily visit UK facilities at short notice and troubleshoot any issues on the same day they come up. The ongoing situation with Russia and the Ukraine has put the supply of high grade plywood in jeopardy and our suppliers have concerns about the price and availability of sheet material which we are following and working to mediate by considering alternative materials and suppliers. We will continue to source some parts from China, as certain parts have proved either impossible or uneconomical to build here in the UK. For these parts only, we have found existing suppliers in China that have weathered the pandemic and who are able to manufacture the components at scale.",

      "1. Mentor doctors to be analytical, critical thinkers via innovative methods of instruction.",
      "Philanthropic University offers education through a blended model of virtual and in-person instruction, incorporating the flipped classroom approach. Students will interact with webinars at home on their own time. They will come on campus for exams, lab instruction, clinical experience, tutoring, and to work in study groups. Study groups and tutoring will foster camaraderie among students while helping them develop collaboration skills\u2014an essential trait for future doctors.",
      "2. Operate a free clinic which will support the underserved while cultivating well-rounded, compassionate doctors.",
      "Our free clinic provides services to patients who are underprivileged and would not be able to get access to eyecare elsewhere. There is a great need within the community, and so students will be able to experience a broad range of patient encounters. Working with underserved populations fosters a deeper understanding of social determinants of health and the importance of equitable care. Students will learn to communicate with diverse populations, many of whom may have language or literacy barriers. The free clinic will build trust between the university and the local community, reinforcing its role as a positive force in public health.",
      "3. Involving all students in research which will expand patients\u2019 access to healthcare.",
      "Philanthropic University offers all students the opportunity to engage in research through hands-on patient care. Research fosters analytical skills, and encourages students to think independently and tackle complex problems. Research fosters curiosity and innovation, pushing students to explore new ideas and solutions. Even if students don\u2019t pursue research careers, they learn how to critically evaluate information and make evidence-based decisions.",
      "HOW YOU CAN HELP",
      "We are looking to raise $40,000 to help cover the costs of accreditation, paying contractors such as architects, and legal fees. Any amount you can donate would go a long way. Thank you for your consideration.",

Charging has never been easier with an utterly effortless experience.",

      "I believe that if anyone catches the drift of the colossal impact this could have on the world when rolling and how sure the growth potential. it will feel as exciting to log into as anyday, Becasue everyday random events are going to occur in various planets and even in the space arena like anomalies and intriguing new galactic weather movements that could be leading to some new planet or moon to explore.\nI think when people hear this vision correctly they will feel the similar feelings ive had for it in that it is that what you always wished the internet could be and should be. This will fulfill peoples dreams, and sort of deep rooted expectations that have been disappointed like a kid who is told about a new toy they are going to get and they imagine all the potential of what it could be and it is something totally different and disappointing. This is that toy that the inner kid in us has wanted for ages and all of us knows is possible of the internet; of what excitement the internet could be daily. The potential of every log in could be fun and profitable. How it will multiply and grow with their efforts and there will be more reward potential for every minute spent on the webspace that it will be beyond addicting, it will be satisfying; This to so many natural desires of humans.",
      "Good day,My name is Ryan McCartney and I had a passionate vision come over me around 2019-20. the lighting would borrow from the idea of molecules being charged from suns and the entire atmosphere would look different. people from all over the world selling or trading in a EASY to use payment screen and process. Please consider what could be, like what you imagined the internet could be. It is a webspace that would be a endlesss(to a digital limit) space that is transversed by spaceships, and has around 15 worlds to play in( we may begin with 5-7). In this space, the heart of it is a global marketplace for anyone to trade and sell and create an sustainable economic situation for themselves. It has the potential to drastically change the world and is what I always dreamed the internet is possible of. Please listen to some of my raw speaks about the program. I appreciate your time. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UnqVv9ujkP78GW...\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1DtIKiwDIyo2Ooq...\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/15CmDuqqWYRSwfX...",
      "someone thrw away the keyword, im not going to blame anyone, prob me. Ryan McCartney Robin Pan. - YouTube\nI would be honored to present an idea for a webspace that is a global market. it would be fun, exalting of all humans poductivity. The idea is that all humans work and create worthy, valuable products, what they enjoy and naturally like to work on. This webspace gives them a social scene to meet eachother throuout the world and validate eachother by selling or trading their products. there are different planets to visit in your custom made ships that the webspace is lighted by a lightsource like the sun, or various ssuns of the planets, and it would reflect off intergalactic particles and there would be a sort of weather that different auroas would blow thro with different colors and the actual flying process would be fun and exciting for the user. everyone can enter the webspace with a ship that is randomly generated if the person is not an active developer. active developers would have there own kingdom, custom spaceship, character, and a sort of trenchcoat that that carry with them that they could show to anyone in the game world wherever they may be saleing or trading; whether thats at the desert world , ice world, water world, music world, food world ,light or dark world and they could show anyone what their selling or trading. trade and sale screen is dark and comfortable and easy. straightforward and not like \" oh no!\" . there would be a beautiful and immediate shipping of items to drop stations in city main areas. you could have a card that you could buy anything from anywhere on the planet that active developers would get and there even is an idea for atm like things that dispense cash in future. the results of sales would go immediately into developers account and they could sale or trade anything that is not dirty. there are ideas for arts, crafts, poetry, music, videos, anything a person naturally likes to produces and work on. Users could coordinate with others they find in the game similar interests and create and market products together. the world s will be brusseling with commotion and have npcss and local people. the desert world has a economy based on auto. like there s races daily echoing what we have seen expressed in others imaginations.. the ice worlds deep oceans is full of beasts more narley than or could be said by some, than that of the water world. the water world has at least 5 citys all very different and for one user they are on a quest to hunt a flock of migrating fish that only move to certain locations at certain time inspired by other creatures movement at that time. theses pay good on certain worlds and citys. the value of these quest would be varied between digital earnings and the possibility to generate real money. like if you could find a crew that you notice posted at the city centers post wall you notice an invite for another travelr in this hunt for this certain species that a certain city in the ice world ocean pay HUGE for and it would be hard and fun. The fire world is hardly ever ventured to . it echos what people have been haunted by and seen and felt . the monsters and things there would be grotesque and scary enough to inspire bale movement. there would be real reward and for a daring crew venturing on the fire world and at certain seasons they are even televised by local ice, desert ,forest , and water world citys . it turns into a betting thing because most crews dont succeed and there have been a few that are slaughtered quick and find none of the massive rewards there like rumored 100,000$ chest and other huge mysterious items of value . A skater clan could make a real world impact by sending care packages like cars houses food to anyplace in the world. a art clan could send huge money to an tech company they like and have had their lives impacted by. ten year olds with tons of ambition n could sell and trade their way to becoming home owners property owners and world impactors . I can think of how much i was filled with when young and wish I had a outlet that i felt like was not a joke and was treating me like a pro and boom have like 10,000$ in two weeks then decide to give it all away and then in a month 100000$ more shows up and i invest in this and that company and property . what's more is those who have been here awhile to could be reinspired and kick butt too. all ages and this is just the skeleton talk I would be honored to have a conversation and present a more fleshed out lala of this vision. a vision for global integration and life and joy and trade that so much money would be moving here and there everyone would have more than enough it would just be about i don't know how to say other than having fun, enjoying the planet we are on together. there are people we pass by daily, maybe we could interact and connect with and even the people all over the world we could actually party together. I like what you are doing and have been inspired by your work . please think about this idea that could change alot. think of what you always were excited about what the internet could actually be . like logging on the the website and your just floating in space in a ship and suddenly a rare black hole opens and sucks you into some depths of the ice world ocean that literally none have been before and at this point millions have played the game and you intereact with a race of people that they have a city and more , they kick you out pretty quickly but still, it was cool and then your back on the ice world surface with dogsled races happening and you hear of events in the desert world . exc.",

As you will have to apply grooming products such as shave cream and aftershave solution which is a waste of time, and you can only use a razor in the bathroom.",

Experience the sublime fusion of innovation and elegance, as nature's timeless wisdom manifests in the design ethos of Keykrush ORCA.",
      "By prioritizing comfort and health, Keykrush ORCA with its split design aims to provide a more ergonomic typing experience. We researched Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and Tenosynovitis, these conditions arise from repetitive motions, localized pressure, and inflammation.",
      "*Our products cannot cure any disease\uff01 If you have serious hand joint problems, please consult a doctor immediately.",
      "Split design allows hands placement for a natural, shoulder-width position. By featuring a split keyboard design, allowing your arms to naturally rest on the desktop (even on the chair armrests), aligning with your shoulder width, helps alleviate strain on the neck and shoulder muscles.",
      "The soft and elastic palm rest supporting the thenar part of your hand eliminates the necessity for additional wrist pads, safeguarding from compression of the carpal tunnel.",
      "The 40% layout is not only for a minimalist and modern appearance, but also to reduce unnecessary hand movements. Minimize fingers lateral movement and the palm movement by reducing the total number of keys, could largely alliviate hand fatigue (using customizable multi-layers for typing).",
      "With this double-curved surface design, reduced fingers excessive stretching, and reduced fatigue as well. The motion of human fingers closing and opening resembles a rotation along a Fibonacci spiral trajectory, and the act of typing is similar to performing work through rotating along this Fibonacci spiral trajectory.",
      "Fibonacci Spiral Trajectory and Finger Joints",
      "Double-curved surfaces require less torque and are more friendly to people with chronic hand pain. Torque is the effect of a force that causes an object to rotate around a point. The torque depends not only on the force applied, but also on the distance from the point of force to the axis point of rotation. This distance in the typing scenario is the distance from finger joint to the keyboard surface. The smaller torque usually means that the fingers do not need to apply too much force to trigger the keys.",
      "The angle between your palms, helps alleviate strain on wrist and avoid Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.",
      "When we make a fist and release it, fingers naturally trace curved paths. \nThe ortholinear layout precisely mirrors this biomechanical pattern \u2013 to achieve dexterity and comfort.",
      "The staggered layout originates from the mechanical structure of typewriters. The first patent for a typewriter was obtained by Sholes in the United States in 1868. Early typewriters arranged keys in a staggered manner to avoid collisions between the mechanical levers. This layout has remained largely unchanged since then.",
      "The MALT Keyboard, invented by Lillian Malt, shifted from the traditional staggered layout and increased thumb usage. In recent years, more and more enthusiasts and manufacturers of custom keyboards have introduced an increasing number of ortholinear keyboards, such as the Dactyl Manuform and Dygma Defy. These keyboards have received a lot of positive feedback from many people.",
      "Stephen Hobday(left),  Lillian Malt(right) and MALT Keyboard",
      "Ortholinear keyboards are typically more compact than traditional ones, allowing users to reach all necessary keys in a shorter time, thus improving input efficiency. For example, the number keys 1-9 on traditional keyboards also follow an ortholinear layout; once adapted, people can achieve very fast input speed with them. Another example is that typing machines used by stenographers mostly adopt an ortholinear layout, reducing lateral finger movement and making input more efficient. While the case of stenography machines might be extreme, it illustrates the core logic: Compact ortholinear keyboards reduce lateral finger movement, significantly enhancing input efficiency.",
      "Ergonomic keyboards are demand-driven products. If your hands often feel pain or you even feel frustration during daily work, and don't have the option to significantly reduce working hours to alleviate the pain, Keykrush ORCA is worth trying. Additionally, in some professional scenarios (such as coding, literary creation, etc.), ortholinear keyboards still hold unique advantages. People with strong adaptability may only need one to two days to get used to it, while those with weaker adaptability might require four to five days.",
      "By integrating Gateron low-profile switches, Keykrush ORCA provides unparalleled typing experience, offering a seamless blend of ease, simplicity and precision.",
      "We've designed slightly curved keycaps that increase the contact area with your fingertips, preventing your fingertips from sore.",
      "Keykrush ORCA features a captivating floating keycap design complemented by vibrant RGB backlight settings, offering a dynamic visual experience that elevates your workspace ambiance. Ensuring versatility to match any environment or preference.",

      "Executive Summary",
      "Hi! I\u2019m Will Halterman, a seasoned sales executive with over 30 years of experience leading global beauty and wellness brands across Asia, Latin America, and Europe. I\u2019ve launched multimillion-dollar product lines and helped thousands of women become empowered entrepreneurs in the process.",
      "Now, I\u2019m launching something deeply personal: Ecohair Nusantara Jaya, an eco-conscious, plant-based haircare brand born in Malaysia\u2014and ready to grow in Indonesia.",
      "Our mission is to help people regrow their confidence\u2014literally\u2014starting from the scalp. With powerful, natural formulas designed specifically for local hair types, we tackle hair loss, scalp stress, and chemical overload with a clean, sustainable approach.",
      "This campaign isn\u2019t just about selling shampoo\u2014it\u2019s about launching a movement of beautypreneurs across Indonesia. With your help, we can create economic opportunity, foster self-confidence, and build a wellness brand people can trust.",
      "If you stop reading here, I hope you feel one thing: your support will directly empower lives, naturally and beautifully.",
      "What We Need",
      "We\u2019re raising $50,000 USD to launch the first phase of Ecohair Nusantara Jaya in Indonesia. Here\u2019s how your contribution will be used:",
      "Even if we don\u2019t hit our full goal, we\u2019ll scale smart: start with smaller inventory, go local with fulfillment, and grow with your continued support.  We are committed to our vision!",
      "The Impact",
      "Hair loss is more than a cosmetic issue\u2014it impacts identity, confidence, and even mental health. In cities like Jakarta, pollution, stress, and poor diet are accelerating this problem, especially among young women.",
      "Ecohair\u2019s formulations, inspired by nature and science, are a gentle but powerful solution. But more than that, we\u2019re building a community-led brand: every sale supports women who earn from home, on their own terms, and as independent business owners as Ecohair beautypreneurs.",
      "We've already seen this model thrive in Malaysia\u2014where we\u2019ve sold over 25,000 units with a 90% repeat rate\u2014and now we're ready to replicate that success in Indonesia, starting with you.",
      "Your contribution will create a ripple effect: confidence restored, income generated, and nature respected.",
      "Risks & Challenges",
      "As with any launch, we face potential delays in:",
      "But here\u2019s the good news:\nWe\u2019ve already secured local advisors and partnerships in Jakarta. I personally have decades of experience leading DTC operations across APAC. We\u2019re also using a proven product line and modern direct selling model that we've tested successfully in Malaysia.",
      "We have backup plans for local sourcing, temporary fulfillment solutions, and tiered rollout to adapt as needed.",
      "Other Ways You Can Help",
      "Even if you can\u2019t contribute financially, we\u2019d still love your help!",

With our own engineering team and high-tech machinery, we are capable of producing all the parts that we designed and developed based on the modifications that we worked on each mechanical movement.

      "Our goal is to make a huge time-telling module together with our signature diamond cutting reflective index. A doughnut-like hour disc rotates mysteriously underneath a spaceship-like structure is what we want to achieve. The huge time-telling module is driven by a set of secret gears combined with unique bearings we invented -- to greatly reduce the turning force and increase the stability of the whole module. We also want it to be futuristic, thus we punched through the hour disc with a CNC machine and filled some of them with lume. The diamond cutting reflective index together with the Swiss Super-LumiNova\u00aeis like a futuristic space station in operation.",
      "The whole module is covered by a triangle structure which is made from an alloy of copper, zinc, and nickel-plated with platinum/black. It is processed with CNC and handcrafted polishing. With the 45-degree minute marks printed onto it, the triangle structure is rich in detail with a sense of futurism.",

      "The hour disc rotates 2 cycles per day, with a pointer located at the bottom of the watch to indicate the current hour. The triangle minute hand is placed in the centre. One angle of which is filled with Swiss Super-LumiNova\u00ae and is the pointer of the minute hand. You can easily tell the time with the 45-degree marks printed onto the triangle structure.",
      "DIAMOND CUTTING REFLECTIVE INDEX",
      "We innovated a new method of index making, the Diamond Cutting Index, in THE MOONPHASE as well as THE ALL-ROUND. It is world-known and loved by many Behrens Original fans. We insist on putting it onto THE STELLAR. The index is cut by a diamond cutter 20 times in two directions; thus the surface of the index is a complex oblique. To give the dial a luxurious touch, light is our major resource. With light reflected on the index\u2019s glossy surface from different angles, a rainbow(chrome) color is created. We believe such a natural phenomenon will attract many of you.",
      "MULTI-POLISHING CASE 220% MORE COST",
      "The excellent case design is one of the significant symbols of our watches. It is also widely loved by 800+ BEHRENS ORIGINAL customers. This time, we decided to provide the highest standard case we can get for you all.",
      "The premium watch case we used on THE STELLAR is exactly the same as we use on the premium standard on THE SPACESHIP. There aren't any bad or tier 2 cases in BEHRENS ORIGINAL. All of our cases are the top tier ones which are more than 220% of the cost of normal watch cases.",
      "In order to make it more sharper and smoother, the watch case is manufactured independently into 3 parts- the two lugs; and the body itself, so as to polish them independently. It then gives out a new level of polishing and exquisiteness than a normal case. Such costly production methods could only be found in luxury watch production.",
      "The case is made of 316L stainless steel which is widely used in high-end watches. Multi-polishing methods are applied: including mirror polished on the bezel and the edges of the lugs, horizontal brushed on the sides, vertically brushed on the lugs, and circular brush on the back. And for this time, we redesigned the dome-shaped sapphire crystal in order to have its smooth and clear curve.",
      "Although these production methods are long and costly, and sometimes it is unnoticeable until you have a closer look, we aim to give you the best, attractive, durable, and elegant watch cases.",

      "SLIM WATCH - 7.9MM MECHANICAL WATCH",
      "Slim appearance is the iconic design element of Behrens Original. Our slim design is adored by 800+ Behrens Original backers and supporters.",
      "In order to have a nice mechanical watch with a thin design, we provide the best we can: With the well-designed cutting of the case and the super-high quality redesigned dome-shaped sapphire, our watch provides an incredible slim appearance. The thickness of the watch is only 7.9mm, exclusively the dome-shaped sapphire. With the dome-shaped sapphire, the total height is only 12.3mm.",
      "Every part of our design is uniquely made for reaching our goal: a thin mechanical watch. We have gone under many tests on making a thin, durable watch. Our design team remade the dial part more than five times to remove 10-30C each time. There are no words that can fully describe the hardship we had in the process, but we have put our efforts wholeheartedly into making this unique yet slim mechanical watch.",

      "Movement is the soul of all watches and that is exactly what attracts all watch collectors. Our factory has more than 15 years of experience in the Swiss and Japanese movement watchmaking and watch modification.",
      "This time we selected the Miyota 9015 for our movement, which is well-known for its slimness, reliability, and stability. This Japan movement functions with a frequency of 4Hz (28,800 A/h), 24 jewels, 42-hour power reserve, automatic winding, and a sweep second movement. With a movement of the height of 3.9mm and 26mm overall diameter, it is super slim. Combining both thin body and functionality, this movement is only used in high-class watches. Although the price of this movement is very high, we persist to provide the best we can.",
      "*the first sample comes out 9 months before to test the reliability and stability. It is running very great for months.",
      "SAPPHIRE CRYSTAL ONLY - 4.3MM THICK",
      "For producing luxurious watches, we persist to use only sapphire crystal for both sides of the watches. Due to the remarkable hardness of sapphires - 9 on the Mohs scale, our watches can hardly be damaged by plain scratches. Thus, we believe that sapphire crystal is the most suitable material for daily wear.",
      "Dome-shaped sapphire crystal is used to give an ultimately slim appearance to the watch. As sapphire is a hard material (A 6mm thick raw sapphire material is used to craft into a 4.3mm dome-shaped crystal), it is beyond difficult to make the dome-shaped sapphire. Since it is costly and time-consuming (our machine can only produce 3 pieces of dome-shaped sapphire crystal max. per day), the yield rate is low.",
      "ACCURACY - 7 DAYS, T0, T24 TESTS",
      "Watch modification and movement tuning are our central focus. As such, absolute accuracy is always on our important checklist. We ensure the quality of every part by using strict control testing standards before assembling the watches.",
      "The testing procedure lasts 7 days",
      "Day 1 Before assembling the watches, the movement is fully wound (also known as T0) mechanically. The movement is tested in five positions, crown left, crown up, crown down, dial-up, and dial down. Then given a rest period of 24 hours(also known as T24), the movement is tested again in the five positions.",
      "Day 3 After assembling all the parts together, the watch is put into an auto-winding machine for 1 day. The watch would be fully wound and be tested with the same testing procedure on Day 1.",
      "Day 5 The watch keeps putting into an auto-winding machine. The watch would be fully wound and be tested with the same testing procedure on Day 1.",
      "Day 7 Before packing, the watch is fully wound(T0) and is tested in five positions again.",
      "All our watches have to pass all of the above procedures before delivery. We make sure that the accuracy of our watches is highly maintained in -20~+20 seconds/day. We tested the watches in more positions than the normal quality checkups do - we tested the watches in 5 positions while the others tested in 3 positions only.",
      "We need to ensure the watches are adequate in every situation. We then on-wrist tested the sample watches for more than 9 months before we started our Kickstarter campaign. The stableness of BEHRENS ORIGINAL watches is highly guaranteed.",
      "ITALIAN CALF LEATHER STRAP -  INTERCHANGEABLE CATCH",

We provide a high quality fine crafted Italian calf leather strap as usual to give you the most comfortable and pleasant wearing experience. The strap with an interchangeable catch on the side of the lugs allows you to change your strap without any special tool.",

      "Every email notification brings a spike of anxiety. This system doesn't just waste time; it crushes confidence and turns a period of opportunity into one of chronic stress.",
      "We believe the job seeker deserves an intelligent, and ethical, ally.",
      "Introducing CareerFlow AI. This isn't just another job board. It's your personal, strategic AI agent, designed to handle the repetitive grind, so you can focus on what humans do best: connecting, creating, and acing the interview.",
      "The Dream: You Level the Playing Field, Automatically.",
      "Imagine a world where:",
      "This isn't science fiction. This is the future of professional life we are building together.",

      "Problem: The Personalization Paradox. Solution: The CV Generator.\nEveryone tells you to tailor your resume, but no one has the time. Our AI does\u2014and it does so with complete integrity.",
      "Let's be crystal clear: our AI never invents skills or experience. It is not a \"fake resume\" generator. The entire process is powered by you.",
      "During a one-time setup, you will fill out your detailed career profile or simply upload your existing CV. This becomes your personal, unchangeable source of truth.",

For years, my job has been to lead international teams in building complex digital systems\u2014from game mechanics and monetization to live event management. I've spent my career understanding user psychology, designing engaging experiences, and overseeing entire production cycles from concept to launch.",
      "But beyond the code and the systems, I've seen firsthand how challenging and broken the job market can be, both for myself and for the talented artists and developers I've worked with. I realized that the same system design and user-centric principles I used to create immersive games could be applied to solve this very real, very human problem.",
      "To prove my total commitment to this mission, I will not be taking any salary from the funds raised in this campaign. 100% of your contribution will go directly into building the product and supporting the talent behind it.

      "A cycling backpack that requires neither shoulders nor a rear rack",
      "Earlier this year, we launched the rack-free on-bike backpack (classic model) on Kickstarter \u2014 and thanks to your amazing support, it was fully funded and fulfilled! ?",
      "Here\u2019s a quick reality check...",
      "There\u2019s a better way to ride. And it\u2019s here.",
      "Our rack-free backpack opens up a new way to carry \u2014 one that rides with you, not on you. No sweaty shoulders, no frame-cluttering racks, just pure, stable performance.",
      "From city commuters to trail explorers, our rack-free on-bike backpack is earning real-world praise from riders who\u2019ve tested it where it counts!",
      "Don\u2019t just take our word for it \u2014 trusted KOLs and YouTubers have put EasiCyco to the test:",
      "From weekday commutes to weekend backpacking trips, the rack-free backpack rides like it\u2019s part of your bike, not extra baggage, you just ride clean.",
      "Attach or detach the EasiCyco bag in under 10 seconds, you\u2019ll love how smooth and frustration-free it feels. Just click, ride, and repeat.",
      "We use an innovative Penta-Lock Support System that anchors directly to your seat post, lifting the backpack behind your bike like it's floating on air.",
      "Instead of one flimsy strap, you get three solid connection points:",
      "This triple-anchor setup gives you a semi-levitated pack that feels weightless and doesn\u2019t sway, even on bumpy rides.",
      "Worried about your gear bouncing around or sliding sideways on uneven trails? Yeah, we hate that too. That\u2019s why we designed the Penta-Lock Mounting System that distributes the load evenly and keeps your ride balanced, even through potholes, gravel, or curb hops.",
      "Inside the bag, we\u2019ve engineered a reinforced Triangle Support base that keeps the bag upright and centered, so it never slouches into your rear wheel.",
      "Together, your pack stays tight, upright, and totally out of your way.",
      "With a 35L capacity and 33lbs (15kg) load limit, you can pack everything from tools and tech to lunch and a change of clothes.",
      "Whatever you carry, the base handles it with ease.",
      "The Penta-Lock arm is engineered to withstand the pressure of a full-grown adult pressing directly down. It\u2019s strong, stable, and break-resistant\u2014so you can ride worry-free.",
      "Forget the awkward unpacking rituals of racks and saddle bags. With EasiCyco\u2019s side-access design, you can unzip and go without fumbling or detaching anything.",
      "The internal retractable support rack is removable, so when taken out, the backpack works just like any standard bag \u2014 offering riders more flexibility.",
      "Made with high-tenacity fabric, it shrugs off dust, repels water, and resists scratches \u2014 even if you toss it on gravel or lean it against a rough wall post-ride.",
      "Easicyco comes with a detachable raincoat that shields your backpack from rain and mud during your ride. When not in use, it packs neatly into the right bottom pocket \u2014 always ready for unexpected weather.",
      "This is your gear garage on wheels. From a helmet sling and taillight mount to a hidden GPS tracker pocket, every detail\u2019s built with riders in mind. Need quick access to a raincoat? Tool kit? Pump? There\u2019s a pocket for that. Both side sleeves are shaped to fit most U-locks, and we even added a strap loop to stop annoying wheel snags mid-ride.",
      "Every stitch, every strap, every buckle in this bag reflects a rider\u2019s need: for stability, for ease, for durability. We engineered this pack with function first, choosing technical materials that could handle sweat, dirt, and daily grind, without jacking up the price.",
      "This is not just another factory-made product - it\u2019s a cyclist-built tool, born from real-world needs and assembled with purpose.",
      "We ship to North America, Europe, Oceania, and East Asia. Shipping fees typically range from the teens to the twenties in USD, depending on your region. The exact cost will be shown after you select your reward tier.",
      "Due to the multiple accessories included with the backpack, the overall package size is relatively large. We've worked hard to find affordable logistics partners to keep shipping costs as low as possible.",
      "The idea behind EasiCyco was first sparked back in 2013. But it wasn\u2019t until two years ago that we decided to fully commit to building the product we always wished existed. As lifelong cyclists, we were tired of cobbling together DIY gear just to ride smarter and lighter.",
      "And it didn\u2019t happen overnight. It took two years of development, testing, and refinement to get it just right.",
      "Our story began when Joe, the founder of EasiCyco, left behind a high-paying corporate job to join a wildlife conservation NGO. In the field, he witnessed not only the impacts of illegal hunting but also the devastating toll environmental issues were taking on natural habitats. This life-changing experience reshaped Joe\u2019s life and his commute. He swapped his car for a bicycle, choosing to live more consciously and sustainably.",
      "But riding deep into remote, rugged landscapes wasn\u2019t easy. Joe often had to carry over 15 lbs (7 kg) of equipment: from animal specimens to testing gear and survival essentials, while cycling mountain roads. Standard backpacks left his shoulders aching, and rear racks caused more problems than they solved. Equipment would fall off without warning, and accessing anything mid-ride was never an option.",
      "That frustration sparked an idea: what if there were a backpack that didn\u2019t rely on your shoulders or your bike\u2019s rear rack?",
      "Joe spent the next few years designing and testing his vision with his cyclist friends, building prototypes in his backyard, and putting them through the ultimate trial during his wildlife conservation rides. In 2023, after more than a decade of real-world testing, EasiCyco was born.",
      "Today, EasiCyco isn\u2019t just about carrying gear. It\u2019s about giving cyclists the ability to ride farther, lighter, and with more freedom, especially those who refuse to compromise on both style and function. No matter what roads you're riding or where your bike is headed, EasiCyco is here to make your journey easier.",

      "It is 100% Natural & Organic and can solve your oral problems without any irritation or additives.",
      "OENKLEN is a revolutionary home-use device to upgrade your oral care routine! Using the ozone water from mouth washing to combining with flossing, cleaning your braces... It will revolutionize your lifestyle in protecting your teeth. It transforms tap water into ozone mouthwash in seconds via advanced micro-electrolysis technology and eliminates 99%+ of harmful oral germs with targeted sterilization in just 5 seconds with no side effects or drug resistance, giving you a full new cleaning experience.",
      "Featured on @Ask A Hygienist, Drawing on her extensive dental expertise, she skillfully explains the benefits of Ozone and convincingly highlights why OENKLEN stands out as the superior choice among other mouthwashes.",
      "Featured on @starring shameka, OENKLEN welcomes you to check out her daily routine with ozone mouthwash! She used a set of testing regents to prove the safety and effectiveness of ozone mouthwash.",
      "Featured on @Cymye Midori, She delivered a thorough introduction to the functionality of OENKLEN and compared the differences between OENKLEN and ordinary mouthwash.",
      "Most people suffer from a variety of oral health issues. However, over 60% of people do not fully clean their teeth even if they thought so\u2014brushing teeth is just the first step for oral health!",
      "To help more people achieve healthy teeth and bright smiles without harsh chemical additives, we developed a simple, safe, and efficient method of creating ozone mouthwash that combines with regular brushing and flossing and results in a more effective long-term solution for oral care. After rigorous testing and careful development, OENKLEN Ozone Water is here.",
      "We made a plaque test to see its effectiveness, where the plaque zone is colored in red/pink, in the next picture, you can see the results compared among no oral care, regular oral care, and OENKLEN ozone mouthwash.",
      "Unfortunately, regular mouthwash doesn\u2019t differentiate and kills all bacteria. It can disrupt the microbiome and impede the normal functioning of your body. These bacteria and other microorganisms make up what is known as the human microbiome.",
      "Ozone neutralizes acidity that is present in the mouth. This is how it can kill the bad bacteria and leave the good bacteria alone. Ozone therapy also supports internal healing and improves the immune system\u2019s response.",
      "In order for the mouthwashes to be shaft stable, manufacturers do add acid to the mouthwashes in order to stabilize the agents and it's horrible because every time you rinse your mouth with Mouthwash it pretty much demineralizes the enamel.",
      "OENKLEN is 100% natural and has no additives. Never worry about it hurting your enamel and causing irritation.",
      "Using only water means that the whole process is organic and environmentally friendly. Not only can it be used by people of all ages, but it can also create an unlimited supply of ozone mouthwash, making OENKLEN the safe, reliable, and economical choice.",
      "Given the many benefits of ozonated water, you might wonder how we can ensure its effectiveness and safety. The answer lies in the breakthrough technologies that OENKLEN utilizes.",
      "OENKLEN generates ozonated water through an electrolysis process. When an electric current is applied to the water, multiple water molecules are electrolyzed into multiple oxygen ions, which combine again to form ozone (O3). The whole process is organic and waste-free and the result is a highly effective ozone mouthwash generated in seconds from just tap water.",
      "Previously, ozone water was only available commercially. That\u2019s because it\u2019s difficult to produce ozone water in a controllable concentration and ozone water is easily decomposed. To solve this, our team developed technologies to monitor the ozone concentration of water in real-time and adapt the solution to different water qualities, achieving the ability to produce stable, reliable and effective ozonated water.",
      "All above serves the purpose to provide people around the world with effective ozone mouthwash for their oral care.",
      "See how OENKLEN makes a difference in people\u2019s lives by improving different aspects of their oral care routine.",
      "Select the oral problems that are giving you trouble and the app will intelligently provide the most effective solution. A customized routine will then be synced to the Daily Clean, Deep Clean, and Flossing modes on OENKLEN. Once synced, you can continue to use the device as usual, simply by tapping the screen. OENKLEN makes it easy to customize oral hygiene solutions for the entire family.",
      "The machine is designed to be smart to help you with the customization of your oral care routine.",
      "Disclaimer: This product does NOT claim to diagnose, cure, treat, or prevent any disease.",
      "In December 2021, OENKLEN's founder embarked on a journey to revolutionize oral care by conceiving innovative ideas that would be refined through a rigorous development process. Over the course of four successive generations of prototypes, the OENKLEN team demonstrated their commitment to professional excellence and meticulous craftsmanship. Their unwavering focus on perfecting their products ensures users receive the highest quality oral care solutions tailored to their needs.",
      "Many years have passed since people invented, toothbrushes, flossers, and other cleaning tools, and there has been very limited product innovation in the field of oral care. OENKLEN aims to revolutionize oral care by offering a range of natural, safe, effective, and eco-friendly products designed for health-conscious individuals worldwide. Our mission is to empower users with radiant, confident smiles and promote overall well-being. We envision a future where families no longer have to shoulder the burden of costly oral healthcare expenses, and together, we can contribute to a more sustainable and captivating planet.",

An ordinary USB cable supports charging to devices, and that\u2019s the ONLY thing it can do. PixelCable is an interactive charging cable with a built-in OLED screen that can be your personal Private Messenger, as it lets you display personalized images and texts. PixelCable can also clearly show your charging device's battery and charging output power status while supporting fast charging and data transmission.",
      "PixelCable comes with two different types: USB-C to USB-C and USB-C to Lightning. It's available in two colors: dazzling black and pearl white.",
      "Whenever you power your device via PixelCable, it will greet you with startup animation. PixelCable is no more than an emotionless electronic, somewhat like a friend saying hi to you when you meet each other. Download QCharger App on Apple Store or Smart Charger on Google Play, and turn on Bluetooth on your smartphone; then, you can choose the animation from the preset images. The animation movement direction and speed can also be easily adjusted according to your needs. Thanks to Bluetooth technology which is designed to wirelessly transmit information between electronic devices, the built-in OLED screen shows a real-time display of your operation on the App.",
      "Note: C to C PixelCable can't be App controlled on iPhone due to different software protocols.",
      "Besides images, PixelCable also allows you to type text messages as boot animation. During the everyday grind, it gets hard to always keep optimism. In general, the stressors of work, relationships and life can take a toll. That\u2019s why it\u2019s very important to look to outside sources for encouragement to help yourself stay positive and motivated. You can type your favorite inspirational quotes in PixelCable. When you see the short but powerful sayings, you will feel that PixelCable is one of your best companions who will always be there supporting you.",
      "Note\uff1aText customization is limited to 60 characters, including the punctuation and blank spaces. The font type, font size and font color are all by default.",
      "Suppose you want to express your affection, regret or gratitude to someone but feel embarrassed of face-to-face communication. PixelCable will serve as a perfect communication tool to allow that personal connection to shine through. You can type what you want to say to your lover, friends, family members or colleagues in PixelCable, and then send it to them as a gift. Surely, the person who receives this gift will never forget how much you adore sharing such a beautiful relationship with them.",
      "Although boot animation only lasts for a very few seconds, it\u2019s also a good way to convey your personality and mood. PixelCable allows you to set a custom image of your choice as your boot screen logo.",
      "Note: As PixelCable adopts a monochrome display screen (88*48 dpi\uff09, we suggest you choose simple images with white characters on a black background.",
      "PixelCable has a built-in MCU chip for intelligent power control. It will auto-detect attached charging devices and automatically adjust the current output to the highest level permitted, extending the battery life of your devices. With the OLED display cable, you are fully informed of the charging power output status and easily get to know whether your device is fast charging or not.",
      "Note: You need to disconnect PixelCable with App to display the real-time current. The error margin within 5% is acceptable due to the power losses in transmission lines.",
      "The built-in display on PixelCable gives you real-time information about your battery percentage, so you will no longer need to wake the charging device to view the battery status.",
      "Note: The screen will display real-time battery percentage after the start-up animation ends.",
      "In order to guarantee preparedness, you can turn on the full battery alert via App. Your phone will vibrate or play a prompt tone to notify you when fully charged, protecting your phone battery from overcharging. Also, it will remind you when the charging is interrupted.  The firmware of PixelCable will irregularly be automatically updated via App. A firmware update will upgrade your PixelCable with advanced operational instructions, providing an even safer and enhanced user experience while maintaining compatibility with other devices.",
      "With a built-in E-Mark chip, USB-C to USB-C PixelCable supports up to 100W Power Delivery, providing fast charging for almost any phone, tablet, USB-C laptop at full speed. MacBook Pro (13\u201d) can be charged to 65% in 30 minutes (with a 100W PD charger). USB-C to Lightning PixelCable supports Power Delivery up to 20 Watts. That means you can fast charge your iPhone 13 from 0-50% in just 30 minutes.",
      "PixelCable enables fast data transmission up to 480mbps. 1G file can be transferred within 24 seconds.",
      "PixelCable is woven with nylon braid to increase durability and shield from heat. This innovation allows the cable to withstand the toughest use under any situation and environment. Premium zinc alloy connector designed with an easy-to-grip feature not only brings a streamlined appearance to PixelCable but also makes it a stylish accessory to complement your smart devices. PixelCable can withstand over 30,000 bends and hold up to 175 pounds (80 KG). No more dreaded splitting or bent ends. PixelCable is 6ft/1.8m long, great length when lying across the couch, the bed or even in the backseat of a car. The attached Velcro strap lets you manage your cable neatly and ensures that your cable doesn\u2019t get tangled up.",

    "allParagraphs": [
      "Sustainable performance leggings | Ethically made in Europe from recycled plastic",
      "VEOM is an exciting innovation in sustainable leggings, designed for leisure use as well as performance. With a wide selection of unique prints, our Europe made eco-friendly leggings are beautifully designed, comfortable and durable. They are ethically made using premium quality Italian fabric sourced from recycled plastic",
      "Much like you, we care about the environment and we have created ethically manufactured leggings and sport bras that combine functionality and comfort so you will love to wear them! There\u2019s no compromise on style, performance or sustainability",
      "Our inspiration is the beauty of nature; it\u2019s also about owning up and taking responsibility for the planet by using the materials available to us in a responsible manner.  We are creative environmentalists that love fashion but firmly believe in recycling, renovating and pure living.  VEOM involves up-to-the-minute fabulously unique prints that are exciting and eye-catching.  Our designs reflect our beliefs and what\u2019s in-style too \u2013 a remarkable combination that really reflects the world we live in today",
      "You\u2019ll love our fit too. Our leggings are created with every body shape and style in mind because we are an inclusive brand. Our leggings don\u2019t fall-down, they feature a high waist, a useful waist pocket and they\u2019re obviously premium quality.  You should expect perfect fit along with excellent stretch with a specially designed gusset so you don\u2019t even need to wear underwear (we won\u2019t tell if you won\u2019t!).  They\u2019re super-comfortable to wear too because of their amazing stretchiness, breathability and athletic flat seam, so nothing gets in the way of powerful performance",
      "We know you want the very best and that\u2019s what VEOM delivers. Our fabric is designed to perform, so you can use our leggings for sports purposes or for leisure",
      "Our fabric is breathable \u2013 which means it whips sweat away from your body so you\u2019re always comfortable",
      "The fabric is entirely ethical because it\u2019s made from recycled plastic that comes from the ocean. It\u2019s also vegan-friendly. So, not only do you feel remarkable comfort, you are doing your little bit extra to help save the planet",
      "VEOM is suitable for athletic use because the fabric is constructed in such a way that it supports your muscles. It also features specialist technology that memorizes your body shape \u2013 your leggings become bespoke to your body!",
      "As well as being made out of environmentally sustainable fabric, our leggings are suitable for cold water washing and come out as good as new. That means we help to reduce wastage of natural resources, such as water and electricity",
      "Use VEOM leggings at any time, they\u2019re perfect for yoga practice, running, aerobics, the gym, outdoor activities or just to relax in comfort",
      "Great looking, performance clothing doesn\u2019t have to be manufactured at the expense of the planet we live in.  VEOM cares about nature and sustainability so we created our leggings out of the highest possible quality sustainable Italian recycled polyester. The material involved is crafted from used plastic bottles and fishing nets, responsibly collected from the Atlantic Ocean.  So, by wearing our leggings and bras, you are helping to preserve marine life and save the planet",
      "Our aim is to bring you outstanding comfort, high performance and a guilt-free conscience!",
      "Together, we can encourage fabric manufacturers across the globe to harness recyclable materials and develop sustainable fabric to protect the world we live in for future generations",
      "It began in 2018 so not too long ago. The team behind VEOM had long been searching for the perfect pair of leggings, leggings with all the features they wanted. Some leggings looked great, uber-stylish and funky but they weren\u2019t eco-friendly. Some leggings were excellent for performance-wear, breathable and odor-free but they didn\u2019t inspire with fun prints or exciting designs",
      "This left us with a dilemma. We had no leggings that ticked all our boxes!  So we thought we\u2019d make our own\u2026 and here we are today",
      "We strongly believe that the only way to conduct business in modern times is in an ethical manner.  We also believe that the whole supply chain must be sustainable, from initial design right through to shipment and even beyond.  Supply chain is more than just about using recycled fabric; it is about understanding the very creation of the product so that sustainability is firmly integrated into all stages of the product\u2019s lifestyle.  When it comes to VEOM, rest-assured that we take into account every single process and material used at each stage of our leggings\u2019 lifestyle. We can safely say that we minimize environmental impact on the planet",
      "The result is a collection of outstanding performance leggings that look great and are completely environmentally friendly!",
      "Our design process is a combination of advanced technology with inspiration taken from traditional arts",
      "All the unique prints utilize handmade watercolor painting techniques.  We transfer them onto the fabric in a sustainable manner using sublimation printing technology which is entirely eco-friendly",
      "To make our current collection, we worked together with professional athletes to select patterns and create prototypes.  Then, we tested our leggings extensively, collected feedback and used the information to further improve them so they deliver outstanding performance",
      "Our sublime comfort comes from a unique method that we use to determine the best fit. To do so, we use a 3D modelling process involving simulation of pressure distribution from the leggings to the body.  The result is outstanding comfort and brilliant fit so you achieve the ultimate performance you desire",
      "Our fabric really is the best possible sustainable polyester and we know this because we tested numerous different types of fabric made out of recycled yarn. We selected the very best available option.  It\u2019s recycled polyester and elastane, vegan-friendly \u2013 entirely environmentally friendly!",
      "We are a dream team \u2013 we like to work hard and play hard but more importantly, everyone at VEOM shares similar values and cares about the world that we live in. Want to meet us?",
      "Pauline (Co-founder) is award-winning fashion designer with her own successful underwear brand, Ligentlerie.  Pauline has extensive experience in garment creation for cinema, theatres and well-known fashion brands",

      "Once the campaign has finished, you will receive a survey detailing how you can chose your style, size and we will ask you for your delivery address",
      "There will be following sizes available and you can be 100% sure that VEOM leggings will suite you perfectly well as they have excellent stretch. If you still not sure then just take smaller size, as you\u2019ll find that the leggings feel better the more you wear them because they adjust to your body",
      "VEOM is an environmentally responsible brand so we make sure our high ethical standards are always met, throughout the process from choosing our fabric producers through to delivery to your doorstep so your leggings arrive in environmentally friendly packaging, using sustainable fulfillment and distribution",
      "We found manufacturers that don\u2019t use child labor and protect their workers with proper health & safety regulations.  Our manufacturing partners are based in Europe and pay a fair wage. We respect a work/life balance so our partners\u2019 workers conduct a normal working day with reasonable hours and they don\u2019t discriminated against race, sexual orientation, beliefs, disabilities or gender",
      "We really need your help to produce the first batch of VEOM leggings.  By supporting our project, together we can make a real difference to the world we live in. Please get behind us so we can create innovative, environmentally friendly, ethically manufactured leggings",

      "Testimonial",
      "\"I love my red O-ring on my iPhone 7 plus even more than I thought I would, but one color doesn\u2019t seem to be enough, so I have purchased a gold one. This is a great product and easy to install. I\u2019ve never been very good at placing a protective screen, so I do have a few very small bubbles, not enough to bother me. As you come out with new colors, I\u2019ll probably buy more. It\u2019s so easy to take on and off that I can color coordinate any time. I chose the gold this time.\" --- J. Sommers on August 10, 2017.",

      "Testimonial",
      "\"This case is perfect! It's simple but solid enough to actually provide some protection for my phone. I've used other ring-like phone cases in the past, but unlike other cases, this one doesn't feel like I can snap it in half when it isn't on my phone. The locking mechanism is also very secure. Overall great case, hoping they come out with the same type of case for the new iPhones whenever they come out.\" --- Z. on August 4, 2017",
      "The Phone Ring\u2019s precision diamond-cut 2-piece hinged aluminum ring, in conjunction with the 3D full cover glass, blends seamlessly; resulting in a completely smooth surface, allowing iPhone users to feel the iPhone the way Apple designed it to feel.",

      "\"This is the best case I\u2019ve ever had. I love it. It is super light, very easy to install and looks slick. Seamless fit the glass protector. Make your phone feel like your phone does not have a case. Having owned almost every iPhone released I am constantly looking for a quality case that protects the phone but isn\u2019t heave (heavy) or bulky. I\u2019ve purchased well over a dozen or more cases and this one is by far the best.\" --- T. Phelps on July 31, 2017.",
      "\"I purchased the black version and it perfectly matches the finish of my iPhone. The metal also has the same feel as the iPhone. It clips on easily and the magnet holding it together is very strong, will not come apart unless you try. I love this case. It is tricky to install the screen protector but the finished product looked great. Great fit and finish! It is easy to position correctly, then with a little pressure the adherence began, drawing itself to the screen.\" --- S. Kelly on July 31, 2017.",
      "The sleek design of the diamond-cut 2-piece hinged aluminum ring implements integrated cushions and complex honeycomb-like structure within structure design using earthquake dynamics (patent pending)  to protect iPhones by dissipating energy from drops.

      "Bath towels are one of the most essential yet underappreciated members of our home. They have three basic tasks to complete: dry our bodies, dry themselves  and look good while doing it.",
      "So, given their simple purpose, why is it so hard to find one towel that combines softness and absorbency, hygiene and style?",
      "We often think little of what towel to choose and why. Moso is a towel with presence. Designed to look, feel, perform and last better and longer",
      "We use a towel multiple times a day. After a shower or a soak in the tub, after we wash our hands, at the beach or the pool.",
      "However, when shopping for a good towel, the abundance and differences in quality and price can be confusing and overwhelming.",
      "Budget towels get scratchy after a couple of washes, take forever to dry and are germ factories. You have to spend quite a lot to make sure that your towel really will be worth its price tag. But we don\u2019t think it has to be so.",
      "In our search for materials we came across the bamboo fiber and thought it was amazing how beneficial its properties were. Working with it was a revelation as we found all the qualities we were looking for. It\u2019s naturally antibacterial, lightweight and fast drying, and is one of the most sustainable raw materials on earth.",
      "In a recent test, a culture of bacteria was placed on bamboo yarn and cotton yarn. Within 24 hours, 99.8% of the bacteria in the bamboo yarn had died, while the bacteria number increased in the cotton yarn.",
      "Comparative studies of properties of bamboo viscose versus cotton fiber in polyester blended knitted fabrics, demonstrate a higher tensile and bursting strength achieved by bamboo fibers. Because of these qualities, Moso Towel doesn't lose its shape and it doesn't shrink.",
      "By weight, bamboo towels absorb 50% more water than cotton ones do in almost half the time.",
      "Bamboo fiber has microscopic holes and gaps, making it more absorbent than any other fiber, which means our towel is highly breathable and also dries quickly. 600 GSM means a lot more absorption capacity in a bamboo towel. In comparison with cotton, a 600 GSM bamboo towel is equivalent to a 800 GSM cotton towel.",
      "Bamboo fabric takes organic and natural dyes more rapidly and thoroughly. It doesn\u2019t need to be mercerized to improve luster.",
      "Moso Towel has a modern minimalist design that blends easily with your bathroom decor.",
      "The Moso Towel is 100% bamboo yarn weaved through a 100% premium organic cotton sheet: 75% high quality bamboo double terry over 25% twisted yarn organic cotton sheet.",
      "We chose a diverse color palette, including both bright and neutral shades.",

    "company_name": "Sanjai Tripathi",
    "allParagraphs": [
      "The AUTOMATED Table Saw Fence",
      "Rip-it\u2122 is a retrofit system that adds affordable automation to your existing table saw setup. Professional woodworkers love Rip-it because it is fast, precise, and easy to use. Table saw work goes up to six times faster! Rip-it pays for itself within weeks in a busy shop.",
      "The system includes a motorized fence with touchscreen control, rack rail, and angle bracket. Here is a brief video showing the core function of Rip-it: dial your desired cut width, the fence moves quickly into place, and then make your cut",
      "Rip-it was invented by master cabinetmaker Jeff Hadaway, who recruited a team of skilled designers, engineers, and businesspeople (\u201cTeam Rip-it\u201d) to develop a robust product and bring it to market. Team Rip-it launched the product first on Kickstarter in July 2023, aiming to raise $150k for final development and manufacturing setup costs. And we succeeded! The campaign ultimately raised $216k from 211 backers. Their support has validated that customers are excited about the product and provided the necessary funding for the first production batches.",
      "Since the Kickstarter, we have heard from several others who want to back the project. In response, we have opened this Indigogo InDemand campaign! InDemand is a platform that enables companies to continue raising money as they start manufacturing and delivering products after a successful crowdfunding campaign.",
      "We are now offering Rip-it as an InDemand backer reward. With this limited-time offer, woodworkers can get Rip-it at a discount off the MSRP while helping to support the manufacturing launch as it occurs. Our target date to fulfill InDemand backer rewards is MAY 2024.",
      "Between now and then, we are finalizing the details of the product design, purchasing components inventory, setting up production, and then making and delivering the first batches of Rip-it. As that work proceeds, we will post updates here on InDemand (and via email and social media channels) so backers and supporters can follow the progress.",
      "The previous Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign provided sufficient capital for us to start production and deliver Rip-it to campaign backers. Team Rip-it is 1000% committed to delivering a finished, robust product and we are immensely and eternally grateful for backers' support.",
      "While additional funds are not needed to launch the product, they would certainly be helpful as we navigate the details and uncertainties of the production launch and build up inventory for future deliveries and sales. Additional funds would allow us to order larger quantities of machined parts and components, reducing costs and supply chain risks.",
      "For Indigogo InDemand backers, we can offer a complete Rip-it fence system as a backer reward. The complete system includes the digitally controlled fence, rail, and bracket to retrofit your existing table saw and table. The standard rail is 86\", which provides 52\" of rip capacity on the right side of the blade and 16\" on the left in our recommended configuration (see below), and users can move or cut the rail shorter to fit their table setup. Our target date for fulfillment of InDemand rewards is MAY 2024.",
      "Rip-it is the product of careful, iterative design and development. The result is a product that is functional while also being robust, full-featured, and easy to use.",
      "Intuitive Touchscreen Control",
      "Control Rip-it via the touchscreen with an intuitive, high-contrast interface that offers the choice of SAE or metric units and fractional or decimal display. The current design includes a 5.5\" screen, and the final production design will have a 7\" screen.",
      "Auto Locking",
      "Once it reaches the precise location, Rip-it automatically locks firmly into place with no action required by the user.",
      "Automatic and Manual Calibration Options",
      "Activate the auto calibration with a push of the button. Rip-it moves gently to touch the blade and detect the zero point. Or, calibrate the zero manually and set it at your preferred location. Rip-it only needs to be calibrated once at startup and will maintain accuracy for the entire shift.",
      "Choice of Units",
      "Users may select inches in fractional or decimal formats, centimeter, or millimeter units.",
      "Jog Function",
      "Use the jog buttons to control the motor directly, moving the fence in either direction for small or large adjustments.",
      "This project is the culmination of a dream that is years in the making. Jeff (the inventor) had the idea for Rip-it over 20 years ago. He had a prototype created and called the product \"Pick-it Fence.\"",
      "That initial attempt to bring the idea to market did not succeed, and the dream went on \"pause\" for a while, but Jeff never let it go. It stayed in the back of his mind. Eventually, he decided to try again. He recruited help from Steele Inc., a product design firm, to upgrade and update the product with modern materials and technology.",
      "The first update Steele Inc. designed featured a touchscreen, modern software control, and an aluminum unibody frame.",
      "Another (very shiny) prototype was created for live testing in professional shops.",
      "The 2023 update included a host of design-for-manufacturing improvements. The final version shipped to backers will be similar to this version but with a few additional enhancements, including a larger touchscreen, more robust mechanicals, and accessory T-slots on the top.",
      "The product is being brought to market by the Rip It Fence Company, which is based in Corvallis, Oregon, and has a manufacturing facility in Roseburg, Oregon. Our company mission is to fulfill Jeff's dream, deliver the product to all the backers, and then continue manufacturing and selling it in the future. We also have plans to develop a series of other affordable automated tools for professional woodworking shops based on the same technology platform developed for Rip-it.",
      "Developing any new product entails inherent risks, challenges, and uncertainties. We are highly aware of those and have worked to identify and mitigate those as best we can.",
      "One issue companies of all sizes and types have had to deal with lately is supply chain disruption. Manufacturing companies are particularly vulnerable if a key component becomes unavailable. With this in mind, we use common \"off-the-shelf\" parts as much as possible and have identified multiple suppliers for most of them. We also have identified local domestic suppliers for extrusion, machining, and anodization of the custom aluminum parts that go into Rip-it.",
      "Many new product companies struggle during the development stages due to delays, cost overruns, or failure to meet customer requirements and demands. To mitigate those risks, we have pursued an agile development strategy that involves building multiple successive prototype versions and incorporating user feedback and testing into each step. This way, we ensure we are developing what customers need and want.",
      "Some companies fail because of cash flow problems or because their business model has fundamental problems. To mitigate these risks, we carefully identified each component on the bill of materials and created detailed COGS and operating expense forecasts. We have received updated parts quotes and secured the lease on our manufacturing facility since the Kickstarter campaign ended, and our forecast model has proven to be accurate so far",
      "Ultimately, our goal is not just to get crowdfunding money. Our goal is to create a business that lasts. With that in mind, we have done and continue to do everything we can to make sure the Rip-it launch is successful, backers receive a great product as promised, and the business is sustainable in the long run.",
      "We have gotten this far thanks to the interest and support of many people, including woodworkers, media partners, service providers, and others who have helped us in various ways over the past few years.",
      "We are offering Rip-it on InDemand to offer one more chance for people to pre-order at a discount before the official launch.",
      "And even if you don't become a backer, you can help us spread the word! Tell your woodworking friends about the product, hit \"like\" to boost our page prominence, and use the Share Tools links to mention us on Facebook, copy the link to share anywhere, and like and follow us on Instagram and YouTube.",
