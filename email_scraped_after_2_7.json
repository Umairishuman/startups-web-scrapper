      "65W PD | 4K Docking | USB Hub | 1TB SSD Storage | Single Cable Setup | Grab & Go Productvity",
      "Cyberize ONE is the world's first all-purpose adapter for digital nomads of modern days. Created by a group of geeks and gadget fanatics, Cyberize ONE provides an all-in-one charging/port expansion/storage solution for an active lifestyle on the go. Whether you are in coffee shops, co-working spaces, public libraries, or even Airbnbs during workcation, Cyberize ONE can always be there when you need it, with its credit card size and less than 100g weight.",
      "Cyberize ONE is designed by makers who get tired of carrying excessive accessories wherever they go. We believe that people who love to explore, create, and follow their dreams deserve a better everyday carry.  It should come with a concise and elegant design, be portable to match your office/travel/commute style, and perfectly integrate with your EDC like Switch, MacBook, iPad, etc.",
      "Cyberize ONE is designed for people who seek productivity, versatility, and tidiness on the move. Whether you are a freelancer, content creator, photographer, or staycation worker, you can always find your grab & go productivity with its credit card size, 99-gram weight, and single cable USB-C setup.",
      "Want to instantly get a clean & productive setup? With Cyberize ONE, you can spare the extra components and headache with its single cable USB-C solution now.",
      "Just like Apple's latest release of the M2 Macbook Air, USB-C is becoming the major and only interface choice for ultrabooks. It's supposed to offer plenty of expandability and charging performance, but the sheer variety of hubs, chargers, and cables is taking your desk from order to clutter.",
      "If modern-day nomads need a Victorinox, then Cyberize ONE should be the perfect gadget. It comes with one USB-C 3.1 Gen2 that runs at 10Gbs bandwidth, two USB-A 3.1 Gen2 for most common peripherals, an HDMI 1.4 port that docks up to 4K 30Hz/2K 60Hz/1080P 120Hz video output, an SSD up to 1TB that provides read/write speed of 550mb/s, and a 65W Gallium nitride (GaN) power charging compatible with PD3.0/PPS/QC4.0 protocol.",
      "It's time to ditch the messy peripherals and accessories in your backpack. Cyberize ONE maintains the major functions of your external drive, hub, and charger while being shoulder-friendly. Getting annoyed at tangled cables and cords every time? Always forgetting or leaving stuff behind? With Cyberize ONE, you only need to take one device for most occasions, minimizing your chance of losing things or stuck in the multi-gadget-verse.",
      "What is the biggest headache for the tech-savvy? Disk space. When was the last time you hesitate paying a hefty amount of money for the extra storage on Apple.com? One tricky thing is that despite you paying multiple grand$ for upgrading the disk space of your phone, laptop, camera, and console, they are in-built storage that lockup with the device and are non-transferrable.",
      "With Cyberize ONE, things can be completely different.  Since it's driver-free and compatible with mainstream devices, it literally acts as your plug & play universal storage space across devices(I am not talking about iCloud). For example, you can transfer the raw photos to Cyberize ONE while charging your mirrorless camera. The next minute you can plug in your MacBook and start editing them right away - without copying from the SD card or syncing them between devices.",
      "Same thing for gamers. Cyberize ONE can be your gaming arsenal across devices - charging, projection docking, and expanding the built-in storage space of Nintendo Switch/Steam Deck at the same time. Engineered for console/mobile gamers, Cyberize ONE allows you to install and play games directly on SSD, while charging and HDMI your game. With its two extra USB-A ports at disposal,  you can always take your gaming setup to the next level with a gaming keyboard, mouse, joystick, and more!",
      "Every year, new gadgets flood out one after another, bringing new value to consumers while increasing the system entropy for each individual: especially for creators, purchasing every new accessory creates a dedicated learning curve for the product, as well as prolonging the process of adapting and tuning the multi-device workflow - a process that only few people would enjoy. Not to mention the added weight in your backpack, storage space warnings, and credit card bills brought by a large number of peripherals, are literally the shackles on the feet of every modern-day nomad. If great ideas bubble up in more places by chance, then the perfect everyday carry should make it happen as easy as possible, not just another key to open the next door.",
      "We found the existing digital peripherals way too boring, after spending lots of money and time searching for an ideal all-around dock for MacBook. The design of mainstream products is almost a homogeneous copy of each other: the same silver-gray metal shell, the same USB-C \"infusion treatment\" connection style, and the same result ended up stuffing backpacks with cables, chargers, hubs, and docking stations.",
      "So we set out to change this. We created Cyberize ONE with simplicity, sustainability, and people-oriented in mind. The development team has always pursued a minimal design at all costs. In order to minimize the size, the team has put a lot of effort into the design of the 3rd generation electronic components, countless adjustments to the mold and appearance, and the iteration of dozens of draft design drawings, all revolving around the word \"one \".",
      "Because Cyberize is pretty small, we anticipate shipping prices for most parts of the world to be $8-12 per each.",

      "Unlike typical backpacks, all your items won\u2019t get lost or disorganized by throwing them into a single compartment. OnePack has 19 specialized compartments to perfectly store everything you need with fast, easy access whenever you need them.",
      "Safety was a very important consideration when we designed OnePack. The secure strap lock gives you convenient security and peace of mind when you are in public places such as cafes or airports.",

Your customized melody playing from the music box will touch his/her heart with a surprise!",

Starting from producing music box movements for a Japanese brand as their OEM partner, Kyooh Precision Industry Co.

I\u2019m going to try to convert some of my songs into N40 format in the coming time.\nAs for arranging songs, I\u2019ve written guides on how to arrange songs (plus some basic music theory). With some adjustments it could be usable to share with future N40 users as well. The guide was co-written by Musicboxrox, and reviewed by several music box enthusiasts.",

      "After receiving our doctoral degrees in the US, we decided to integrate our expertise in engineering and education to start our own company. A tiny music box we bought in Austria when we first knew each other was the seed that inspired our startup dream. While we were recalling our shared memories in the past 10 years, we decided to redesign its cylinder to let it play more melodies of our own choices, and then our product development journey began in 2016.",
      "My first job after getting my doctoral degree in Electrical Engineering was at Intel's headquarters in Silicon Valley. At that time, I didn't really know what entrepreneurship was all about. I had a close colleague with extensive work experience who would often talk about the various adventures he had experienced in a startup company. Compared to the stable nine-to-five life in a big corporation, the stories of startup companies were incredibly intriguing to me.",
      "Since the project I wanted to work on was related to hardware, I made the determined choice to return to Taiwan, my home country, to start my own business. From the very beginning, I was focused on combining technology with culturally meaningful themes.",
      "Coincidentally, my wife, Dr. Shiao-Chen Tsai, and I had bought a music box when we first met during our summer exchange program in Austria. It could only play a short segment of Mozart's \"Eine kleine Nachtmusik,\" and we couldn't change the song, so it was a bit disappointing. This memorable music box was forgotten in our storage for many years. Because of this connection, we wanted to make the music box play songs that held our shared memories.",
      "The journey of the app-controlled/MIDI controlled music box, Muro Box, is far from over. We hope that you will join us in the next phase of our adventure: the development of the N40!",

      "The World's Lightest Wireless Gaming Mouse Featuring Breakthrough Customization and Weight",
      "Project Highlights: Breakthrough Customization and Weight",
      "This project is to bring the Art of the Gaming enthusiast community to the rest of the world through the world's lightest RGB wireless gaming mouse. This mouse is for those who appreciate custom designs, are interested in modding and DIY projects, the look and feel of custom PCs and enthusiast gaming gear. The Ultra Custom is your entry point into the hobby and world of enthusiast gaming and modding.",
      "Just like a fine tuned engine for a race car driver and custom athletic footwear for a sprinter; there are nuances in a gaming mouse that can enhance a gamer's performance and speak to their persona. We have designed a custom gaming mouse incorporating the latest technology, trends and feedback of the top mouse enthusiasts and pro gaming communities. Here's a summary of the key features we have incorporated into our mouse that will enable anyone to make a custom personalized high end mouse themselves.",
      "Ultralight weight design",
      "The Ultra Custom is currently the lightest RGB wireless gaming mouse available on the market at ~66 to 73 grams. Other highend wireless gaming mice on the market weigh around 80 grams. The honeycomb design is based on enthusiasts modding and 3D printing weight reduced shells. The honeycomb shell design enables an ultra light weight while maintaining a structurally strong design.",
      "You will also have the option to lower weight down further to 58 grams in full wired mode. But why wired mode? For enthusiasts, they want to eliminate any tracking lag from their input devices and that means typical wireless mice have about 12\u201318 ms of lag which can be seen and felt in game - skating, delayed or floating feeling. The Ultra Custom has a 1ms USB report rate, optimized MCU and latest R&D wireless technology making input lag virtually negligible. You will not be able to distinguish the difference between the Ultra Custom in wireless vs wired mode.",
      "Our Ultra Flexible Type C wired Cables were developed so that even in wired mode, the Ultra Custom will feel almost wireless. Plus, custom matching cables on a mouse enhances the bespoke look and feel of a matching themed battle station.",
      "Ergonomic Design",
      "Based on a proven ergonomic shape, the Ultra Custom is suitable for small to large hands. The mouse will enable gamers to play for hours without wrist aches or hand pains. With 100% PTFE skate feet, the Ultra Custom glides buttery smooth.",
      "Ultra Flexible Type C Wired Cable System",
      "Enthusiasts are usually sick of the stiff heavy cables plaguing typical gaming mice on the market. The stiff cables add to the resistance and friction between the gaming mouse wire and their mouse pad. Enthusiasts have been for years iterating different designs to have the lightest and most flexible cables in order to reduce drag and friction on their mouse movements.",
      "We have developed an FCC compliant cable that is on par with a fully custom paracord cable. You will be able to select from a range of different colored cables for Wired Gaming mode. Modders, DIY and enthusiasts usually order these custom paracord cables for as much as $20 and then proceed to open their mouse and replace and install the cable themselves for both aesthetic and performance reasons.",
      "With our cable system, you can have a custom ultra flexible cable with matching colors to your gaming setup with out all the hassle - simply select a cable and plug it into your mouse. USB-C is the emerging standard for charging and transferring data. The Ultra Custom is perhaps the only type-C wireless rechargeable high end gaming mouse -  you can quickly charge to full power in under 1 Hr. Get up to 66 Hours before re-charging.",
      "Mouse Shell Cover & Button Customization",
      "Enthusiasts take great lengths to optimize and personalize their mouse by disassembling them, modding them and repainting the cover shells. You can now simply select different shell finishes and tool-lessly replace the button and top shell covers in seconds. Select from different color finished top shells with either a honeycomb design or solid cover shape.",
      "DPI button Customization",
      "Match and personalize your mouse design by selecting from different colors and button heights for the dpi button to support your grip style. Lower DPI button heights for example are better suited for palm and 1-3-1 users so that there is less accidental DPI clicks in game.",
      "With your support and contribution, we can increase production and lower costs.",

      "Designed to smartly carry your valuables on quick runs.",
      "Runners care a lot about product performance.  In the making of FITLY, we logged hundreds of miles, challenging every inch of every component.  We are proud to say that FITLY has the most cutting-edge components available today.",
      "FITLY is a World's First with its totally awesome patent pending Thoracic Belt System: two subpectoral front pockets attached to a stretch belt that retracts slightly so all items are kept in place when you run and are naturally accessible without affecting your running form.",
      "We are sometimes asked whether FITLY is designed for man and woman.  The upper straps are adjustable.  You can see in the animation below that this particular runner wears FITLY fairly high.  She could have lowered the thoracic belt at least 4 inches/ 10 cm, making it totally fine for both man and woman and even below your cardio.",
      "Picture yourself running. Your hands naturally swing by your thorax making it very convenient to store and retrieve small personal items in the two subpectoral pockets without any impact on your running form. No need to stop or modify your gait to securely store a car key your friend just handed to you or to retrieve a gel.",
      "The Thoracic Belt has a gentle stretch (retraction force) which locks all items in place. Nothing moves. No bouncing is possible and the retraction force is calculated to be soft enough to not affect breathing.",
      "This Patent Pending invention is incredibly useful during vigorous activities, especially runners who want to safely carry a few personal items.",
      "The right pocket has three mini-slots to put away loose coins, a key, lip balm stick, or maybe a beautiful shell you pick up during your morning run so they do not rattle during your peaceful run!",
      "The Fidlock system combines two fastening concepts in one: a magnetic snap and a mechanical lock that clips tightly around 1 of 3 positions, offering useful adjustments while on the run.",
      "Cell phones are important for security, communication, music, orientation and training logs (apps).  They're so essential, we see people running with them in their hands daily. When asked if they'd prefer to stick it in FITLY and the reaction is always the same.",
      "Cell phones are expensive, what if it rains?   You need to protect it!",
      "FITLY's Phone Slot is exactly designed to host your cell phone with two significant advantages over almost any other solution:",
      "With today's headphone button, voice control, and smartwatches, hundreds of phone commands are readily available without the need to stop and access your phone:  Play Music, Skip, Answer/hang up, Call home, Play Radio, Hear messages, etc. Your phone is tucked away, entirely protected from the weather yet perfectly available.",
      "Constructed using high tenacity military-grade fiber technologies, the CORDURA\u00ae fabric is exceptionally durable and puncture resistant.",
      "Our prototypes have been used hundreds of time, under heavy rain, and gallons of sweat with no sign of deterioration.  The fabric is \"best in class\", used in high-end mountain guide equipment, made to endure the toughest weather.",
      "FITLY IS MADE TO LAST!",
      "S.Caf\u00e9\u00ae is an eco-friendly (Cradle to Cradle certified) soft fabric that combines nylon yarns and recycled ground coffee at the cellular level. The fascinating benefit is natural odor resistance.  Green innovation is a win-win!  The S.Caf\u00e9\u00ae fabric also naturally cools your skin temperature down!",
      "Sweat, drizzle, pouring rain, FITLY\u2019s 200% UltraWick is a techno-fabric that drains moisture and leaves you dry.  So soft, wear it on your bare skin!",
      "Run, sweat, rinse, hang\u2026 repeat!",
      "FITLY is equipped with YKK special noise-free zipper tabs.  The tabs cannot move when you run so annoying ticking noise are impossible.",
      "Silence is gold.",
      "All you need for a quick run precisely fits in one of FITLY\u2019s multiple compartments.",
      "All water resistant.",
      "NB: We have posted a list of items designed to be stored for each pocket sizes at the bottom of the page.",
      "Using the steadiness of your upper back and chest area, FITLY\u2019s X-Shape distributes the weight to snugly fit your body contour.  It allows free running movements while preserving total body symmetry.",
      "A pleasant feeling of wearing almost nothing\u2026",
      "FITLY has five easy adjustments to make it your own:",
      "Drizzle or pour, the PU-coated Cordura fabric is water-resistant. It does not make FITLY waterproof but resistant to endure the toughest weather!",
      "No need to time the weather, postpone a work-out or try to outrun the oncoming storm.  No need for a plastic bag either!  Just keep on running and know your valuables are protected.  Very useful!",
      "Front and back safety reflective bands as well as silver reflective logos for your night adventures. See and be seen!",
      "Also available is a 2-inch long webbing to attach an additional light.  It is especially important for bikers on an early morning ride.",
      "Trivial but important, we placed a mini whistle directly in the front pocket so it can be immediately accessed.",
      "FITLY is a running accessory made for quick runs. The majority of people (85%) we surveyed run with 2 or more items, the most frequent are Cell Phones and keys (car, house, hotel).",
      "Of the 15% remaining, half would prefer having their cell phone for security and communication in the case of an incident but had not found a suitable way to carry it.",
      "For longer runs, where hydration and heavier gear affects performance, lots of options already exist.  Hydration is important but less of a focus in short runs (sub 45 min).  You can carry 130 ml/4.4 oz jugs or flasks in one of the front pockets and about 3X as much in the secret pocket.",
      "...you can do less!",
      "Light and thin FITLY is also a clever solution to carry small personal items for travel, day trips, and less vigorous activities, such as kayaking, walking, hiking or just a visit to the museum or a city event. For travel, stick your passport or wallet in the \u201csecret\u201d side pocket for added protection. Wear your FITLY under your jacket for complete security.",
      "Three different color accents and 2 sizes.",
      "FITLY covers sizes from 26 In/67 cm to 40 In/102 cm (under breast measurement), which spans from XS to XL.  Once you have pledged, we will reach out to you for your color and size selections.",
      "Since we launched FITLY, we have gathered 1000+ Positive Feedbacks!",
      "Some were goosebumps worthy:",
      "\u201cI love FITLY! I\u2019ve tried multiple running belts and bags and they all ride up or move once I get going. And the material never seems to keep my phone safe from moisture. FITLY stayed snug, fit comfortably, and it kept my phone dry!\u201d",
      "\"FITLY is extraordinary, a true gift to the running community\".",
      "\"I wanted to keep the prototype I tested!\".",
      "\u201cI have been a runner my entire life and FITLY is one of the best product I\u2019ve ever used. I can jog or sprint with my wallet, phone, and keys and it won\u2019t move even with the added weight. It feels just like a part of your body\u201d.",
      "\"I am running every other day after work and from work. I absolutely need my phone and have to take my car key with me. I tested FITLY. Nothing ever moves and my phone is 100% protected even when it rains. NEED ONE!\".",
      "Jean-Marc created it. Yohan designed it. Nicolas made it happen technically. Olag gave it a beautiful visual identity. Nicolas made the world aware of it and David is about to fabricate it!  All above average experts in their respective fields.",
      "FITLY is a reality thanks to their dedication and selfless generosity.",

      "Always together. An AI Pet that\u2019s just like the real thing.",
      "Moflin is an AI Pet created from a totally new concept. It possesses emotional capabilities that evolve like living animals.",
      "Moflin is so small it will fit on the palm of your hand yet it also has its own unique AI. Moflin will develop its own personality through interaction with its owner, just like a living animal.",
      "Moflin received multiple awards including the Best of Innovation Awards at CES 2021.",
      "From children to the elderly, Moflin will be an affectionate partner that will bring you healing and a peace of mind to your everyday life. It is an AI pet robot with a totally new concept of adapting to your lifestyle and being emotionally close to you. It will be a very different experience from a typical cold, affection-less robot.",
      "With its unique AI and mechatronics developed to make it closer to a living animal, you will instinctively find Moflin small and cute like you would a real pet. Very different from the traditional robot.",
      "Moflin is intricately designed so that it not only looks like an adorable baby animal through its movement and looks but also from its body structure and touch. From the initial stages, we researched the mechanism of what makes something \"cute\" and created a robot that humans will instinctively and biologically perceive as \"cute.\"",
      "Moflin pursues its concept of realizing a user experience that adapts to everyday life. This is possible due to a simple design philosophy of having sensors that detect changes and an actuator that creates movement. You don't need complicated settings or special monthly fees. You also don't need to worry about your images and voices being uploaded to some server. Moflin is self-contained and will evolve through daily interactions with its owner. You won't get bored as you watch it develop its own unique personality.",
      "Life with Moflin is like living with a real pet. Seeing it lay and recharge in its birdhouse-like wireless recharging device is too cute. No need for complicated procedures. Moflin will make sounds and movements just like a real sleeping baby animal would. This reaction will surely stimulate your motherly instincts.",
      "You can choose from the following luxurious Moflin furs.",
      "Silvery Gray is a silver color that has a 3 dimensional touch to it. It is a calm color that will adapt to everyday life. Golden Brown is a brown/beige/shimmering goldish color. We believe that a color that doesn\u2019t stand out too much is the right color for your companionable pet. Whether it be a 2 Moflin Set or a single Moflin, we're sure you will enjoy your new life with them.",
      "Moflin received global media attention from the start, including Technology Media, Start Up Media, and Social Awareness Media. There have been mentions of the positive possibilities for robots and technology in this era of COVID-19, and we have incorporated these ideas into our development.",
      "Masahiko Yamanaka studied mechanical engineering in Osaka Prefecture University and majored in production and supply chain management. After receiving a Masters degree in mechanical engineering, he started working at IBM Japan (formerly IBM Business Consulting Services) as a management consultant. In 2012, he started his own start-up and worked on various businesses that involved developing new business opportunities and creating joint ventures with large firms. In 2016, he founded Vanguard Industries, a company working to realize and accelerate innovation by strategically partnering with large companies. Masa loved to build things since he was a child and during his college years, he worked on the development of Human Powered Aircrafts, and for his Masters degree he studied production systems and supply chain management using Genetic Algorithms and Evolutionary Computation. His achievements include research on modeling and simulation on combinational optimization issues.",
      "Vanguard Industries was founded in 2016 in Tokyo, Japan, with the mission of realizing and accelerating innovation. We create Venture Builder businesses where we collaborate with R&D departments of large firms and universities to develop and verify market potential for ideas and technology prototypes that have a positive impact on our future. Our strengths lie in the planning and implementation of innovative concepts by combining technological elements such as software, hardware, and network. We create projects with R&D divisions of domestic and international firms and organizations. We also participated in numerous international technology conferences and continue verifying and developing concepts and businesses. With regards to Kickstarter, we previously launched the PAGES/Chair campaign. The campaign was very successful and it was selected as one of \"The Cleverest Awards 2019: 50 Products We Don't Want to Live Without\u201d in Architectural Digest magazine. As a result, it ended up being selected as official furniture in a hotel. \nWe started crowdfunding Moflin's Prototype on Kickstarter, and this was a huge success as we placed in the all time Top 10 in the Robotics category. We are continuing our development based on this success. Our company was also able to secure Seed round and Series A investment, and we are placing this project and campaign on Indiegogo as our next milestone.",
      "Vanguard Industries with its PR & Video Production Team",
      "This project was formed through a partnership between the R&D department of a large firm and Vanguard Industries Inc. From the beginning, we strived to create something that felt real, cute, and \u201cKawaii,\u201d worthy of being a person\u2019s partner and continued our R&D with visions for the future. We believed that Moflin being able to feel love and having love for others was an important factor towards the application of various ICT technologies and as a touch point to our everyday lives. This was our original concept and we continued to develop our AI Pet robot. In November 2019, after internal review, we presented Moflin at the Web Summit in Lisbon, Portugal. In July 2020, we started our Kickstarter campaign for our concept model.\n  We aim to successfully deliver our first product in February of 2022. We also plan to continue our roadmap for further development and make Moflin an integral part of your everyday lives.",
      "From the prototype stage of this project, we received global support from crowd funding platform Kickstarter to continue our development. The development of multiple technological areas as seen in the fusion of AI engines and Mechatronics is an important perspective in creating a happy life with Moflin, and we are currently creating  a structure so we can deliver Moflin to everyone. In order to improve the quality of the product and user experience, we placed Moflin prototypes at physical stores and incorporated user comments and feedback into our development.\n  We aim to continue developing our Moflin concept so that it makes a positive impact on society. We believe that Moflin has the ability to improve the Quality of Life by becoming a communication agent as new values and lifestyles emerge in these uncertain times of the COVID Pandemic. We strive to create solutions for a better future via our Moflin Project.\n  To the people who support our project, we will share with you our progress, and we hope you can join us on this exciting adventure.",
      "1. Unexpected costs\n  We conducted multiple tests throughout the development of this product and have a prototype that meets the quality and standards to sell to the public. So we are pretty confident on costs with regards to the development, but because of the current COVID-19 situation and the difficult situation in procuring electronic components, there are uncertainties with regards to parts procurement. For example, prices of parts lot size could increase. We are working with our partners and their network to stabilize the procurement risks.\n\n2. Delays in manufacturing\n  We considered various possibilities of challenges and responses through the manufacturing process and have planned accordingly. But if the parts deliveries are delayed because of the current COVID-19 situation and the difficult situation in procuring electronic components, this could have an impact on our manufacturing timeline. To minimize this risk, we have created a very conservative schedule and thus created a buffer to keep on schedule as best as we can.\n\n3. Delays in delivery.\n  In addition to procurement, we may experience risks in delivering the product to our backers. We conducted delivery tests not only in Japan but also between Japan and the US, and calculated the costs, fulfillment, and other delivery options. But because of the current COVID-19 situation and the difficult situation in procuring electronic components, issues we haven\u2019t thought of could pop up. But we do plan on handling any problems that come before us to the best of our ability so that we deliver the product to you without any worries on your part.",

With a background in developing training shoes, we\u2019ve pursued footwear that truly supports foot health, and this journey led us to reimagine the SETTA.",

Select Your Size:\n   - Small (24-25 cm): Best for shorter feet, offering a snug fit. Expect a slight toe overhang (1-2 cm), which is normal for the open-toe design of traditional SETTA sandals.\n   - Medium (25-26 cm): Ideal for average foot lengths, providing versatility. Toes may slightly overhang the front edge, enhancing comfort and the traditional aesthetic.\n   - Large (27-28 cm): Suits longer feet, ensuring ample space. Minimal toe overhang maintains the intended minimalist style and breathability.\n\n3. Consider Fit and Toe Overhang: Traditional setta sandals have a minimalist, open structure, so a slight toe overhang (1-2 cm) is intentional for comfort, breathability, and the traditional aesthetic, especially when worn without socks. However, it\u2019s not mandatory for toes to overhang. If your toes sit flush with or behind the front edge, the fit can still be appropriate as long as the sandal feels stable, doesn\u2019t slip, and supports your foot comfortably. Excessive overhang (beyond 2 cm) may indicate the sandals are too small, while too much space at the front could suggest they\u2019re too large.\n\n\nKind SETTA\u2019s sizing system simplifies finding the perfect sandal to complement your style and stride.

      "Quality Earth Friendly Homes Will Provide Millions Of Workforce Families Housing & Food Security",
      "The number #1 reason millions of hard-working families, Americas workforce, cannot get ahead or afford to own a home, make their monthly mortgage or rental payments is because their incomes are simply too low, and have been stagnate for years. Workforce families are having trouble feeding their families and keeping up with the cost of inflation that is eroding away a lot of their buying power, that is preventing them from meeting their most basic needs.",
      "Provide quality, earth friendly, truly affordable homes at scale that can be ordered in minutes and delivered in days to any build site in hundreds of cities located throughout Canada, U.S., and Mexico, and ultimately the world, that millions of working class, workforce families can truly afford. The Complete CHK is a revolutionary, highly scalable and efficient approach to addressing the truly affordable housing shortage.",
      "This means families will benefit from:",
      "My beloved Mother Mary L. Sagona, my number one cheer leader, investor, best friend and believer in me and this business model was critical to our company existence, and of course to my existence too. We started this company with the help of numerous successful business owners, advisors to somehow find a solution (\"impossible dream\") that would provide tens of millions of lower incomes and \u201cmissing middle\u201d workforce families with truly affordable, quality, earth friendly homes at scale fast. After many dead ends and wrong turns, we finally arrived at a highly scalable and efficient business model for our times.",
      "After many meetings with VC / venture capitalist, Angle investors and high net worth \"Family Offices\", we have decided to fund the growth of our company by simply sharing our profits and company stock with the very people we built it for, the working class, workforce family. The reason for this decision was to maintain complete control of our mission, and to ensure we're always operating on the smallest margin (which the greedy investors did not want any part of).",
      "We founded this company on the concept of humanity not greed. We have decided to also pass on 100% of all Economies of Scale EOS savings that we will receive from the thousands of our product vendors / suppliers of roof trusses, wood framing, insulation, electrical wiring, plumbing, counter tops, kitchen cabinets, flooring and so on, where 100% of those savings will be passed on to our customers in the form of lower and lower home prices in perpetuity.",
      "Our company has the capacity now; to delivery our Complete CHK at a quantity far greater than any other on site built or in factory built home company through the #2,325 brick and mortar order fulfillment distribution centers that are located in hundreds of cities throughout three countries - Canada - Mexico - U.S. where we have positioned ourselves to leverage an existing international network of existing brick and mortar stores known as, The Home Depot (HD).",
      "Our company has the ability now; to deliver up to, literally #1,620,000 Complete CHK to multiple markets per year where our customers can expect delivery of their home within (2-14 days) from the time of their order. We have also \"checked off all the boxes\" where our Complete CHK will be engineered to the highest international building standards, via IRC / International Residential Codes - IBC / International Building Codes - CBC / California Building Codes. They will also be welcomed and approved by all city building and planning departments, banks will finance them, general contractors and their subs who are familiar and trained in stick built home construction will welcome our customers building contracts, and they will not be rejected by the NIMBY / \"Not In My Back Yard\" communities, but rather will be welcomed by the YIMBY / \"Yes In My Back Yard\" communities.",
      "We have identified three key market points.",
      "1) There is a large market for people who will invest in a company that produces smaller, more affordable homes.",
      "2) There is a large market for people who are interested in buying smaller more affordable earth friendly homes.",
      "3) There are tens of millions of Working Class, Workforce Families whom cannot afford their current overbuilt, overpriced homes.",
      "We are also planning to build build hundreds of truly affordable, Master Planned, Replicable CHC beginning in the U.S. with plans to expand throughout Canada and Mexico and ultimately the world, all ranging in size from 5-30 acres each with a projected 10-14 homes per 1-acre. Each CHC will offer seven unique floor plans with its own unique concept theme. All homes and rooms will be available for purchase or rent, including options to lease to own, all at below market prices. We will provide on site classes how to build your own home for free with the purchase of any Complete CHK. Customers will be able to select their floor plan concept theme and lot number as easily and quickly as buying a gallon of milk from their neighborhood grocer. CHK and CHC construction projects will result in generating thousands of good paying jobs in hundreds of cities where over #30,625 general contractors and #402,676 home builder related businesses are located in the U.S. alone and who are licensed and trained in wood frame construction. See Q&A for more details on CHC.",
      "Phase I: Will involve securing $5,000,000 in donations / funding support through this crowdfunding platform that will provide us with the means to accomplish two very important goals. The first goal will include building three prototypes, Model A1280 / A600 / B468 with Garages and Carports. This will enable us to begin providing tours / demos that will result in generating Complete CHK orders including national and international publicity on a great human interest story on the comeback, modern upgraded version of the Sears kit home.",
      "Your funding support will also help to cover additional expenses, that include legal, accounting, marketing new home designs, 3D development of a master planned CHC, including multiple applications for IP, patent protection.",
      "Phase II: Your donations support will also enable us to begin a launch of a more aggressive fund-raising campaign where we will offer the general public shares in our company with the intent to raise another $75,000,000 per year for 3 years through the Private Capital Markets via SEC Reg A crowdfunding that will be promoted on our own private platform and developed by SEC approved service providers. This phase will involve expenses for SEC attorney legal fees, accounting fees and marketing expenses that will also provide us with substantial additional operating capital needed for building multiple CHC, beginning with our first to be located in Bend Oregon.",
      "In the Private Capital Markets, we will offer millions of shares of company stock to workforce families who will then be enabled to invest as little as $25 per share (compared to Boxable that has a minimum buy in at $1,000). Workforce families who will benefit are the nurses, schoolteachers, single moms and dads with children, people who pump our gas, bag our groceries, restaurant workers, including, police officers, firefighters and so on; whom are all struggling just to get by each month. These are the hardworking people that inspired my mother and I to start this company.",
      "When you support us, you will receive several benefits. First and most important, you will know that you are helping us to provide truly affordable, quality, earth-friendly homes for millions of struggling working class, workforce families. You will also benefit through a new and lucrative Income Opportunity where in exchange for helping us to share our story with the world, you will be provided a sales referral commission fee for each home or garage sold.",
      "The impact of your support will also reach, far beyond helping us to provide millions of affordable homes. It will also spill over with benefits into society in many other non-tangible ways. When people feel more secure and safe in their homes, with the ability to pay their bills with more money left over in their bank accounts at the end of the month, including having more quality food in their pantry and with more hope for a brighter future in their hearts, they will be happier and more productive members of society. We will all benefit from this in ways that can\u2019t be imagined or calculated on a balance sheet. Quality, truly affordable housing is one of our most basic needs and rights as humans.",
      "We are the only company of its kind in the world that can deliver truly affordable, quality, earth-friendly homes to literally millions of families per year.",
      "We have secured key barriers to market through non-disclosure and non-compete agreements with The Home Depot & LOWES, who operate a total combined of over #4,000 stores. We are projecting LOWES who will be our second order fulfillment distribution center to be online for 4th quarter of 2025 where we will have the ability to deliver a grand total of over #3,000,000 Complete CHK to multiple markets per year.",
      "We have also secured a non-disclosure non-compete agreement with a company in Chicago that owns the Sears brand, who have expressed that they are \"very interested and excited\" in our business model and licensing us their iconic brand \"Sears\" for the purpose of us renaming / rebranding as Sears Cottage Home Kits and Sears Cottage Home Communities. This marketing opportunity will provide us with the ability to rekindle the public\u2019s very favorable memory and association with the iconic Sears brand that at one time was the largest retailer in the world.",
      "The risk is low. I can confidently tell you based on the market response to Boxable and from 100% of everyone we have spoken to about our vision, from The Home Depot to LOWES to Sears and to the many other individuals including our senior business advisors whom themselves have built very successful companies, have all responded in the same way every time . . ..\u201d This sounds great Bill where can I see one of your homes\".",
      "At the very least you can help us achieve our first funding goal by getting the word out by sharing our story with all your friends, to as many people as possible through Indiegogo share tools and through all your social platforms.",

      "The fan was not merely a practical item,\nbut an elegant extension of one\u2019s taste and emotional sensibility.\nTo offer someone a fan infused with scent\nwas to convey a message too delicate to be spoken aloud.",

      "Yet over time, this beautiful custom faded into history,\nand the fan became seen mainly as a tool for cooling.",
      "At Kyoto Asanoha,\nwe seek to revive the culture of the scented fan\u2014\nnot as a relic of the past,\nbut as a quiet, sensory tradition reimagined for modern life.",
      "The making of a Kyo-Sensu\u2014a traditional folding fan from Kyoto\u2014\nis a collaborative art, born from generations of refined craftsmanship.\nEach fan is the result of meticulous work by multiple artisans,\neach specializing in a particular part of the process.",
      "Below are the primary steps that go into the creation of a Kyoto-style folding fan.\n(This represents the general flow followed in Kyo-Sensu production.)",
      "The foundation of every Kyo-Sensu lies in its carefully chosen natural materials\u2014\nbamboo for the frame, and Japanese paper or cloth for the fan surface.",
      "Artisans begin by selecting high-quality bamboo,\nwhich is de-oiled, sun-dried, and then precisely split into slender pieces\nto form the bones of the fan.",
      "For the fan surface, Japanese washi paper or textile fabric is prepared.\nIn the case of washi, two sheets are layered together in a process known as jibari,\nwhich reinforces the material and enhances its durability.",
      "Each step reflects a deep respect for both material and tradition\u2014\nthe beginning of a fan that is not just functional, but cultural.",
      "The pre-processed bamboo is then carefully shaped into fan bones,\neach one requiring a high level of precision and craftsmanship.",
      "At this stage, small holes are drilled into each bone,\nallowing them to be later bound together with a pivot pin.\nSome bones are also adorned with delicate decorations or carvings,\nwhich may not always be visible\u2014\nbut reflect a deep appreciation for hidden beauty and inner refinement.",
      "Even these minute components are treated not just as structure,\nbut as expressions of Japanese aesthetics.",
      "The fan surface becomes the canvas\u2014\nadorned with traditional patterns and modern motifs,\neach design carefully chosen to reflect the spirit of the times.",
      "Using precise contemporary printing techniques,\nartisans apply the designs with balance and elegance,\nensuring that every fold will align harmoniously when the fan is opened.",
      "Once the design is complete,\nthe fan surface is creased and folded into fine, uniform sections,\npreparing it to be joined seamlessly with the bamboo bones.",
      "This step is where craft meets artistry\u2014\ntransforming raw material into a functional work of visual poetry.",
      "This is the pivotal stage where form and structure unite\u2014\nthe decorated fan surface and the bamboo bones are joined to become a single, functioning fan.",
      "Craftsmen apply glue evenly to the reverse side of the fan surface,\ncarefully align it with the fan bones,\nand press them together with exacting precision.",
      "Once affixed, the fan is dried and re-folded\nto restore its elegant, symmetrical shape.",
      "Finally, the outer (main) and inner (middle) bones are brought together\nand secured at the base using a tiny metal fastener known as the kaname\u2014\na term that also means \u201clinchpin\u201d in Japanese,\nunderscoring its symbolic and structural importance.",
      "In the final stage, the fan is opened and closed repeatedly\nto ensure a smooth and balanced motion.\nArtisans adjust the folds, correct subtle asymmetries,\nand polish every detail by hand.",
      "Only after this final care is a Kyo-Sensu considered complete.\nIt is more than a functional object\u2014\nit is a refined expression of craftsmanship, harmony, and time-honored technique.",
      "As you hold a Kyo-Sensu in your hand,\nyou are not just using a fan\u2014\nyou are experiencing the quiet legacy of generations of artisans,\nwoven into every fold, and breathed into life with every motion.",
      "Takuya Aiauchi, Founder of Kyoto Asanoha",
      "I have long been captivated by the beauty and depth of Asa\u2014hemp\u2014so quietly woven into the fabric of Japanese life.\nAt first glance, this folding fan may seem unassuming.\nYet within it resides the texture of tradition,\nthe scent of nature,\nand the spirit of uncompromising craftsmanship.",
      "We did not create this fan simply to sell a product.\nWe created it because we believe the world today could use a gentle reminder\u2014\nof the quiet strength of hemp,\nand the everyday rituals that center us.",
      "If, while holding this fan, you feel even a flicker of lightness, calm, or quiet connection,\nthat would bring us more joy than words can express.",
      "Thank you for encountering this fan.\nAnd thank you for welcoming it into your life.",
      "Reawakening Hemp's Cultural Spirit",
      "Today, the legalization and rediscovery of Asa\u2014hemp\u2014are gathering momentum across the globe.\nIn many Western countries, its eco-friendly resilience, material versatility,\nand potential in medicine and wellness are being re-evaluated with fresh eyes.",
      "And yet, in Japan\u2014a land where hemp has been an integral part of daily life and sacred rituals for over 12,000 years\u2014\nthis ancient plant remains widely misunderstood.\nModern Japanese society often conflates taima (cannabis) solely with narcotics,\na legacy of postwar legislation and lingering social stigma.",
      "As a result, the deep cultural meaning and broad utility of hemp have been neglected,\ndespite its long-standing role in spiritual, textile, and architectural traditions.",
      "Kyoto Asanoha is a brand born from the desire to change that.\nWe seek to bridge Japan\u2019s rich hemp heritage with the renewed global interest\u2014\nreintroducing Asa not as a taboo, but as a timeless, intelligent material for modern living.\nThrough thoughtful design and storytelling,\nwe are breathing new life into a tradition that never truly disappeared\u2014only faded from view.",

    "company_name": "Chi Yan Cheng",
    "allParagraphs": [
      "With a uniquely patterned acetate outer case; spreading our balanced, fuss-free life philosophy",
      "Following on from the B\u00d6RJA collection launched in 2017, ALLISDONE design studio presents the second collection of LAGOM Watches \u2013 Sj\u00f6.",
      "Our co-founder Daniel grew up in Stockholm and moved to Hong Kong 8 years ago. This relocation from Sweden to Hong Kong, taught him the importance of living a balanced, fuss-free life so he decided to spread this philosophy to the world, and created LAGOM Watches.",
      "\u201cLAGOM\u201d has long been a vital deeply-rooted aspect of Scandinavian culture - the Swedish concept of \u201cnot too much, not too little.\u201d That which is enough, sufficient, satisfactory. Just right.",
      "In each collection of LAGOM Watches, there are two important elements - the stainless steel case and an unique acetate ring. Its simple yet aesthetic design evokes the Swedish philosophy of moderation.",
      "Sj\u00f6 means lake or small sea in Swedish, a country blessed with 11,500 km of coastline and around 100,000 lakes. Its capital, the city of Stockholm, is situated on fourteen islands of an archipelago where Lake M\u00e4laren meets the Baltic Sea.",
      "Daniel, our co-founder, was mostly raised by his grandfather who worked in the shipbuilding industry in Sweden. Unsurprisingly, he spent lots of time sailing around with his grandfather when he was a child, and this is where he fell in love with the ocean and the vessels who sail on it.",
      "Having similar geographical features, Hong Kong naturally reminded Daniel of home. Victoria Harbour, situated between Hong Kong Island and the Kowloon Peninsula, bustles day and night with all manner of watercraft; from the historic Star Ferries to cruise liners, cargo ships, and wooden fishing vessels. Thus, Daniel was inspired to have two different dial designs in the Sj\u00f6 collection.",
      "This choice was also inspired by the Vasamuseet, the maritime museum in Stockholm, which showcases salvaged ships from history. Ships are the main transport of the ocean, yet it is the sailing control panel that has the most importance for sailing on the tremendous empty oceans.",
      "A ship\u2019s control panel serves as the design inspiration for one of the dial designs in the SJ\u00d6 collection (LW029 to LW036).",
      "In addition, the blue acetate symbolizes the ocean, and the unique pattern on the acetate pieces imitates the waves of the sea. They can be calm but quickly become raging; just like the ups and downs of our everyday live. The uniqueness of each acetate furthermore tells our own individual story.",
      "The stainless steel case highlights the lion rock spirit of Hong Kong, the core values passed by Hong Kongers from generation to generation. This spirit enablesd the people of Hong Kong to evolve from fishing villages into the dynamic global financial hub it is today. But in return, the people lead a fast-paced city life. Hence, we would like to add some \"lagom\" into people's everyday lives, so we can all slow down and discover the beauty of life. The combination of the stainless-steel case and acetate ring symbolises the harmony in diversity.",
      "Daniel grew up in a traditional Swedish family and no matter how busy the family members were, they spent lots of time together. But in Hong Kong, Daniel was separated from his family and he found himself alone. To remind himself of all those precious moments, he gave the watch the bolded strokes on the 5-10-hour marks, representing 17:00 to 22:00 in the evening.",
      "We have sourced the acetate from Mazzucchelli 1849, an Italian company that has existed for centuries. They supply acetate of the best quality and in the finest traditions.",
      "Every acetate piece is laser cut and polished by experienced watchmakers. We cannot guarantee the acetate pattern is the same on every watch, but we like this uniqueness.",
      "The quartz movement is from Swiss Ronda, it comes with battery will last for at least 36 months.",
      "The premium leather strap is from Italy. It is super soft and sits very well on your wrist.",
      "Please understand and appreciate there will be small differences in the patterns on the acetate of our watches. Our watchmakers polish them individually and all are made with heart.",

      "Welcome, dear backers, when you enter this page, I think you will be attracted by this metal gadget that looks like a seahorse, of course, it is certainly not a metal seahorse model, it is a collection of a wrench, pry bar, bottle opener, screwdriver bit, ratchet mechanism, window breaker, and multi-functional EDC tools. Please stop by for a few minutes and listen to our story.",
      "I think most people had some experience. When the screws on your favorite mountain bike come loose, you want a wrench to tighten it, when you need to open the tin and open a bottle of beer to celebrate with your friends, you hope to have a pry bar and a bottle opener in your pocket, and you need a window breaker to take you out of trouble in an emergency.",
      "But our pockets are small and limited, even a backpack can't be filled with all kinds of bulky tools, so a pocket tool that combines multiple functions with one is especially important, and that's why we designed this titanium multifunctional wrench pry bar in the first place.",
      "Well, let's see what powerful functions this little seahorse tool can perform!",
      "The 6-in-1 functional design is a highly integrated design concept, the core of which is to achieve multiple functions through a single product, thus greatly enhancing the practicality and convenience of life. This design concept can be widely used in a variety of life scenarios, helping to make your toolbox lighter and more compact, bringing unprecedented convenience.",
      "Adjustable wrench, is undoubtedly a frequent appearance in daily life of the \"Omnipotent Little Helper\", its wide range of applications, across the furniture assembly to every corner of electrical maintenance, all highlight its indispensable importance.",
      "It is especially worth mentioning that the rows of grooves at the opening of the wrench are like precision teeth, which not only give the wrench extraordinary anti-slip performance, but also ensure that it can achieve a tight bite with the bolt or nut in any working environment, so as to easily and stably complete the task of tightening or disassembly. It not only improves the work efficiency, but also ensures the safety of the operation, so that every operation is more handy and gets twice the result with half the effort.",
      "You can open the wrench by flicking the roller to the left with your finger. You can adjust the size at any time according to your actual needs. After use, you can pull the wrench back by flicking the roller to the right in the same way.",
      "The maximum opening size of the wrench is 18mm, which can meet more than 90% of your needs in daily life. Its total unfolding length reaches 152mm/6in. This indicates the extraordinary strength contained within. The super-long torque is undoubtedly the perfect combination of strength and efficiency, it is like a powerful assistant, so that you can easily resolve in the face of a variety of complex problems.",
      "Under the wrench, a multi-functional V-shaped pry bar is integrated, which can also be called the all-purpose nail puller. It not only gives it the ease of pulling out nails, but also the ease of opening cans and lifting daily heavy objects. Its flat edge design allows it to cut through cans and disassemble delivery boxes quickly and neatly.",

      "Both sides of the product are designed with 5 tritium slots which can be used to install tritium tubes, which not only enhances the technology and fashion of the product, but also makes it easier for you to locate and find it quickly in the dark. We offer five tritium tube colors to choose from (green, purple, yellow, blue, and red,), you can choose your favorite style to make it look more unique",
      "We also offer luminous vials as an additional option. Luminous vials make light by absorbing light. They can be charged under a bright light source and will glow in the dark for some time. This option is generally less expensive than tritium tubes and may be suitable for those who do not need constant glow or are looking for a cost-effective option. However, the brightness and duration of light depend on the amount and intensity of light absorbed.",
      "On the head of the wrench, there is a specially designed string hole, which makes it extremely convenient for you to easily hang it on your keychain, mountaineering buckle or hiking bag. At the same time, it also effectively avoids any damage or injury that may be caused by accidentally dropping it while walking, running or performing other activities.",

      "When faced with complex maintenance work and feeling stressed, a cleverly designed wrench can not only serve as a practical tool, but also unexpectedly become a stress-relieving and relaxing little toy.",

This simple operation is often distracting and allows one to temporarily take a break from tedious maintenance work, achieving a relaxing and stress-relieving effect.",
      "Of course, if you like to frequently take the screwdriver head out of its storage slot and put it back in again, that's totally your freedom, as long as you're happy.",
      "This wrench has a very unique streamlined design, incorporating geometric patterns and serrated shapes on the appearance, as well as carefully designed concave and convex surfaces, making it look very fashionable and technological. The use of these elements not only breaks the monotonous and dull image of traditional tools, but also makes people shine through the visual impact and layering.",

      "Tough,Super Bright,Convenient |IPX6 Waterproof |5 Light Modes |Dual-Purpose Clip|50-Meter Beam",
      "Let\u2019s face it: When things go sideways, a basic flashlight won\u2019t cut it. You need something tougher, smarter, and ready for anything. Meet the EchoSwitch\u2014built with tough Grade 5 titanium, a dual-light system, and 5 customizable modes. Use the powerful main beam to light up trails, switch to the sidelight for up-close tasks, or trigger the SOS strobe to signal for help. While other EDC lights stick to one setting, the EchoSwitch adjusts to whatever the moment demands.",
      "Whether you're camping under the stars, tackling DIY projects around the house, navigating emergencies at home or on the road, from outdoor adventures to everyday tasks, EchoSwitch flashlight ensures you're always prepared for any situation.",
      "Many EDC flashlights still rely on traditional designs\u2014single beams with limited brightness, simpler materials, and a focus on basic tasks. The EchoSwitch changes that. Here\u2019s how:",
      "Forget \"just enough.\" The EchoSwitch gives you control, durability, and the right light for any situation.",
      "The main light of the EchoSwitch has two brightness levels. In high mode, it emits a powerful beam that can illuminate a long distance, perfect for navigating dark trails at night or searching for lost items in a large area. In low mode, it offers a more subdued yet still bright enough light for close-up tasks like reading a book in a tent or checking small details.",
      "The EchoSwitch's main beam delivers a powerful 50-meter reach, cutting through darkness to illuminate trails, search wide areas, or spot distant hazards. Its focused beam ensures clarity even in challenging conditions, making it ideal for outdoor adventures, emergency navigation, or securing perimeter visibility.",
      "The side light also has two brightness settings. The high mode is great for lighting up a wider area, such as when you need to light up a campsite or work area. The low mode provides a soft glow, ideal for creating a relaxing atmosphere in a tent or as a night-light.",
      "Designed for precision, the sidelight offers a 10-meter spread optimized for close-up tasks. Use it to repair gear, read maps, or work in tight spaces without blinding glare. Its soft yet ample coverage balances functionality and comfort, perfect for campsite chores, vehicle repairs, or subtle ambient lighting.",
      "In emergency situations, the side light's red and blue strobe mode comes in handy. This highly visible flashing pattern can be used to signal for help, whether you're lost in the wilderness, stranded on the side of the road, or in any other emergency situation.",
      "Why it matters: From midnight bike repairs to power outages, EchoSwitch adapts to your needs instantly.",
      "EchoSwitch\u2019s tail magnet delivers unmatched hands-free versatility. With its strong pull force, it securely grips metal surfaces for tasks like car repairs or bike maintenance. Stick it to tools, machinery, or campsite gear to free your hands for complex tasks or emergencies. Rugged and adaptable, it\u2019s the ultimate tool for DIY projects or crisis response, blending magnetic stability with tactical flexibility\u2014no compromise, just light where you need it.",
      "At 7.2cm (2.8in) long and weighing just 30g, it\u2019s lighter than your car keys and smaller than a lipstick. It's small enough to fit in the palm of your hand or slip into the tiniest of pockets.",
      "A built-in keyhole lets you thread EchoSwitch onto keyrings, lanyards, or even a necklace. Never lose it, and always have light at your fingertips.",
      "But what part of EchoSwitch could really make a difference is the dual-purpose clip. Designed for seamless portability, this clip securely attaches to belts, pants pockets, or backpack straps in either face-up or face-down orientation. Its adjustable tension grips fabrics firmly without any damage.",
      "Moreover, the clip transforms the light into a multipurpose tool. Clip it to your backpack strap for hands-free map reading, secure it to a bike frame as an instant headlight, or attach it to a hat brim for nighttime repairs. It makes the EchoSwitch adaptable to various situations.",
      "The EchoSwitch titanium flashlight is precision CNC-machined with a flawless sandblasted finish, blending rugged functionality with jewelry-grade elegance. Every contour and edge reflects meticulous engineering, ensuring a seamless, scratch-resistant body that feels as refined as it looks.",
      "Forged from aerospace-grade Gr5 Titanium, this flashlight thrives in harsh environments. It resists corrosion from saltwater, sweat, or industrial chemicals, while its ultra-durable construction survives drops, impacts, and extreme temperatures\u2014whether in freezing blizzards or scorching desert sun.",
      "Engineered for reliability, the EchoSwitch\u2019s IPX6-rated seals guard against water intrusion. It withstands heavy rain, accidental submersion, or muddy adventures, keeping its LED core dry and functional even in the toughest conditions.",
      "The EchoSwitch is equipped with Type-C charging port. With just 40 minutes of charging, you can fully charge the flashlight, getting it ready for your next adventure or task. No more waiting hours for your flashlight to charge. The Type-C port is also widely compatible with most chargers, so you can easily charge your EchoSwitch wherever you are.",
      "Here is a direct instruction of how to deploy the EchoSwitch:",
      "Each EchoSwitch flashlight comes with a Type-C charging cable. And we offer free worldwide shipping for every backer. Select the appropriate reward tier based on your desired quantity. Early pledges ensure the best discounts.",
      "We also offer add-on options include accessories you may need, along with customization services, providing you with the flexibility to tailor your pledges according to your specific requirements.",
      "We are excited to bring the EchoSwitch to life. Here's our projected timeline:",
      "April: Production of the EchoSwitch will commence. We've partnered with top-notch manufacturers to ensure the highest quality products.",
      "July: Production will be completed, and we will start shipping the EchoSwitches to our backers. You can expect to receive your very own EchoSwitch and start enjoying its benefits by July.",

    "allParagraphs": [
      "Dining in at Home has Never Tasted So Good.",
      "A Love of Dining Theatre",
      "Many styles of dining are as much about the experience as the food. Think about the theatre of the Teppanyaki Table where the skilled chefs chop, slice and flip pieces of food to the delight of their audience, often with flames jumping from the table.",
      "Or perhaps the fiery experience of the Yakiniku Table where you grill your own slices of meat and vegetables over open flames of heated grills, exactly as you like.",
      "Whilst these experiences are great fun, they are not exactly easy to recreate at home - until now. With the SteakStones Ishiyaki Set, you can sear every slice of meat, fish or vegetables to perfection live at your dining table on our super-heated Lava Stones.",
      "How to Heat",
      "Simply heat the stone on your hob or stove (gas or electric), under your grill or broiler as close to the element as possible, or even on your barbecue to between 300-350c (550-660f). Remove the stone from the heat and place it in the Steel Tray which is safely recessed into your Bamboo Board.",
      "You can do the sizzle test as shown below to check the stone is fully up to heat. Then, you're ready to go. Simply rub a very light coat of cooking oil on the stone which prevents the meat, fish or vegetables from sticking and you're ready to go. You can cook each slice exactly as you like, with the last bite as hot and delicious as the first.",
      "Whilst you may have seen some nice enough looking Ishiyaki Sets in Restaurants in the past, these use stones that simply don't hold the heat aswell as our Lava. The set below is a perfect example; it looks great, but the tea light under the stone does nothing to extend the cooking time of the stone which will be just a couple of minutes compared to the 20-30mins sizzling time you get with SteakStones super-heated Lava Stones. We deliver form and function in equal measures for your dining enjoyment.",
      "The dry, searing heat of our stones makes them perfect for cooking thin strips of steak and vegetables as you would have in a Yakiniku Restaurant and is also ideal for some succulent Sashimi-style Fish including Salmon, Swordfish and Tuna or some deliciously seared Scallops.",
      "We urge you to try and find some Prime Kobe or Wagyu Steak which when cut into strips is simply delicious when simply seared on the stone, perhaps with some soy and wasabi for that delicious, salty heat kick.",
      "Our Experience",
      "SteakStones products are tested in the most rigorous Commercial Kitchens and feature in top quality venues such as Sushi Samba in London and Amsterdam and Catch in Las Vegas and New York and in the past we have made bespoke designs for both these companies, so are used to delivering new products under pressure.",
      "From this background, we can guarantee our products will give you many years of enjoyment at home. They will serve you many of the best meals you will ever have, the only downside is yours might become too popular a location for dinner!",
      "SteakStones Exceptional Quality Guaranteed",
      "We're a family business, as you saw in our Video, but we are also the experts in this method of dining, since our Founder got fascinated with the properties of Lava Stones many years ago. Since then, we've sold many of our sets all over the World, but whilst this new set is nearly ready to go, the almost global lockdown to the Hospitality industry due to Covid has had a major impact on our business and with pressure on our income and we are looking to continue the availability of this product from our Kickstarter Campaign to the Indiegogo Community.",
      "So we are offering some great special offers available to offer this product to you and to keep ours and our partners business moving.",
      "Rewards",
      "We also have some great optional extras as shown below which compliment your Ishiyaki Set and create a fun, modular dining system on which you can enjoy many varied and healthy meals.",
      "The Ishiyaki Set is perfect for some thinly slices meat, fish or vegetables and you can also enjoy a hearty meal as shown below. Check out the little guys face a few seconds in. Sometimes being a product tester is pretty cool.",
      "The dry, searing heat of our super-heated Lava Stone sears in all the flavours and succulence of your chosen meat, fish or vegetables and is an extremely healthy way to dine that you'll enjoy for many years with your quality SteakStones products.",
      "Beautifully Seared Fish on the SteakStones Ishiyaki Set",
      "We'll finish off with a few minutes of sensationally searing Steak as that is what we promise to you. The best meal of your life, every time you dine. Happy Sizzling from us all at SteakStones.",
      "Environmental Commitments",
      "Long-Lasting Design",
      "Our first product design is now 15 years old and bar some minor cosmetic changes uses the same materials and design as it did back then. Our products stand the test of time and we expect this to be no different for our new Ishiyaki Sets.",
      "Reusability and Recyclability",
      "Our Lava Stone has been a few million years in the making and there's a chance it will last just as long into the future. We haven't yet been able to test this far forward, but our products last incredibly well in tough commercial settings, and even more so with lighter use at home.",
      "Sustainable Materials",
      "All of the bases of our products are made from Bamboo, nature's fastest growing and strongest material. The Lava we use is produced naturally by the Earth itself; we don't think you can't get more sustainable than that.",
      "Environmentally Friendly Factories",
      "For every cubic meter of Lava we take from the foothills of Mount Vesuvius, we plant a quota of Olive Trees in place. This in turn produces Olive Oil which is used locally by Restaurants.",
      "Risks and Challenges",
      "We're experienced at delivering great products and don't see any changes to this. A more important risk is that people get bored of eating the same old meal at home. We're here to prevent that. Enjoy some sizzling strips of Sirloin or Wagyu. Find yourself some Kobe, and this is simply the only way to enjoy it. Fancy some fish, try some sizzling cubes of Tuna, Salmon and Swordfish and maybe some Scallops. Simply sear the outside and enjoy the succulence and flavours trapped into every bite. We promise we'll deliver you a simply sensational dining experience, and once you will enjoy for many, many years.",

      "Soundots Ai-2 is a compact speaker capable of playing high-quality sound in true stereo with a clarity and a bass response like you\u2019ve never heard before. That\u2019s all well and good, but the true power of Soundots lies in its capability of stacking with others of its kind.",
      "If that sounds confusing, think of it like this: you have three Soundots. You can use your three Soundots as three separate Bluetooth speakers. You can also stack those three Soundots together, vertically, horizontally, or both, and they will instantly start playing together. Suddenly you have a soundbar for your TV and a beefy sound system for your party next Saturday.",
      "But how is this possible?, you ask with a confounded look upon your face.",
      "It\u2019s all done with the help of... c o m p u t e r s.",
      "Yep, there\u2019s a built-in artificial intelligence. We made it in-house in Sweden. We then named it aiFi and started rocking. Because that\u2019s exactly what aiFi does. It makes sure that no matter how you stack your Soundots, the sound system optimizes the audio for you.",
      "So, this is basically a game changer?",
      "Yes. If you ask us, we truly think that this is the future for speakers and sound systems.",
      "Woah! 360! Get that VR headset out and let's watch this thing!",
      "Alright, but just so I get it... Soundots is a portable speaker that stacks with other Soundots?",
      "Yup!",
      "So... How does it compare to other speakers?",
      "Well, that depends! Luckily, we\u2019ve done tests. Many, many tests. One lone Soundots can hold its own against any speaker of the same size. We recommend checking out some of our reviews which you can find below.",
      "The real magic happens when you stack them together, and that\u2019s the fun and much more interesting part. And, just so you know what we\u2019re talking about here, the stacking capability is virtually endless. You could in theory stack 65 000 Soundots together and they would still work and perform, but you would probably have to get a bigger back yard...",
      "Three Soundots is comparable to any trade of the mill soundbar at around $700-800, or a wireless HiFi speaker at around $700. The real difference with Soundots is that your sound system is portable, compact and comes with the capability to split up.",
      "So, you get our point. The sky is the limit. If you have any further questions about this subject, we definitely encourage you to reach out. We\u2019re more than happy to help tailor your dream system for you.",
      "Let\u2019s talk price though...",
      "Look, we get it. You\u2019ve seen speakers that cost a fraction of what we\u2019re asking, but here\u2019s the thing:",
      "Quality is important. It really is. The Soundots that you purchase today are going to play for years and years, no matter if you stick to two, three or six for the rest of your life or if you decide to expand down the line.",
      "It would have been easy for us to put our AI in a cheap speaker with bad components and call it a day, but we\u2019re not interested in that. We\u2019re in this for the long run, and that means taking risks.",
      "Ultimately, we\u2019ve spent the last years developing our own dream speaker, and our dream speaker is packed with high-quality components and technologies that serve the listener.",
      "Our founder Fredrik Gunnarsson is the visionary behind Soundots and his passion is to make great sound - and the experiences that goes with it - available to everyone.",
      "Out of this passion, our journey began in Sweden in 2014 when we successfully developed and crowdfunded the first intelligent modular speaker. Now, we're making it even better.",
      "If you backed us back in 2014, we hope that you'll be as excited as we are about the new features. If you are about to take your first step into the Soundots world - welcome aboard this vibrant journey!",
      "The Ai-2 is the next step in the Soundots evolution. It follows in the footsteps of its predecessor - the stacking is still king - and while it performs above and beyond on its own, it is of course fully compatible with the Ai-1 (and our upcoming products!). With Soundots, buying a new speaker doesn't mean throwing your old one away. It's all about expanding on what you already have!",
      "After figuring out how many Soundots Ai-2 you want, the next step is picking a color. Our award-winning design lean on natural materials and colors. We want your Soundots to look good in any environment. Soundots Ai-2 comes in the new color Matte Black, and of course we're not letting go of the tried and tested Industrial Gray.",
      "We also encourage you to read about us over at these publications:",
      "Below, you can read more about the power that you gain from stacking Soundots together. Note that the raw equivalent power expands exponentially as you stack more and more.",
      "Interested in the details of one Soundots Ai-2? Awesome! We hope this tables will satisfy your curiosity regarding the inner workings of Soundots. If not, don't hesitate to contact us! We'll happily answer any questions you might have.",
      "Soundots Ai-2 is currently under development. Below, you can catch a peak at the first prototype, spray-painted black so that we could at least get a feel for what the matte black is going to look like when it's blasting some tunes for us later this year.",
      "Prototype movie from Soundots on Vimeo.",
      "We know the feeling. Visit www.soundots.com to claim your Soundots Ai-1 while you wait for the Soundots Ai-2. They will sound just as great together!",
      "In 2015 we successfully ran and fulfilled an Indiegogo campaign. That's how we funded our first generation of Soundots (it was called AiFi at the time). We are familiar with the challenges and risks that come with a crowdfunding campaign and we are not starting from scratch. Ever since the launch of the Ai-1, we have been working on improving the Soundots formula, along with the associated hardware, applications and technology. Our team is made up of some of the brightest minds in the industry and we have confidence that we will deliver beyond your expectations.",
      "However, we do ask for your understanding regarding the possibility of delays. It's not uncommon that something unforeseen happens that will compromise the quality of the final product unless carefully handled. We will not release the Ai-2 before we are absolutely happy with it.",

      "The market is flooded with handheld vacuum cleaners, each touting its unique features. But are these features truly what you need? Do they really address the pain points you experience during use?",
      "After extensive research, we've identified three major pain points in the everyday use of handheld vacuums: the challenge of emptying the dust cup without scattering dust back into the air, leading to more pollution; insufficient suction power, leaving fine dust and debris in corners uncleaned; and the difficulty of removing pet hair or human hair entangled in the brush roll during prolonged use.",
      "To tackle these issues, we've developed the ROIDMI X200 Jet: an ALL-IN-ONE AUTO-EMPTY CORDLESS VACUUM, specifically engineered to overcome these common challenges.",
      "The ROIDMI X200 Jet combines four secret weapons to revolutionize cleaning:",
      "Auto-Dust Collection: Simply place the vacuum on the self-dust collection base, and it automatically starts collecting dust from the dust cup. It cycles through this process three times to thoroughly transfer all the dust from the cup to the collection station.",
      "Extra-Large Dust Bag: The ROIDMI X200 Jet features a 2L dust bag, capable of holding 45 days' worth of everyday dust. There's no need for daily cleaning; after 45 days, just remove the bag and dispose of it in the trash.",
      "70-Minute Extended Battery Life: The dust collection station isn't just for collecting dust; it also serves as a wireless charging base. The built-in lithium battery provides an impressive 70 minutes of runtime, ensuring you won't run out of power halfway through cleaning.",
      "Powerful 29.4kPa Suction: Worried about insufficient suction? The ROIDMI X200 Jet continues our tradition of powerful suction as the core of a vacuum cleaner. With a strong suction force of 29.4kPa, it effortlessly cleans everything from large dog food particles to fine hairs.",
      "The ROIDMI X200 Jet features an innovative self-dust collecting base station, equipped with a 600W Powerful motor, providing an overall cleaning suction power of 16,400Pa. The default auto-dust collection mode cycles three times to ensure a thorough cleanup, leaving the dust cup spotless and transferring all dust into the station's dust bag.",

      "Discover VIRGO: The safest cycling helmets designed for e-bikes. The future of helmets has arrived. Experience the cutting-edge of helmet design made for optimal balance of safety & performance.\n\n\n\nAfter 8 successfully funded Kickstarter campaigns, we went with our 9th one with a bigger & better product. Thankful to all who believed in us, the previous you made the previous nice & reliable products come to life. We\u2019re looking to continue providing you with more innovative & successful products that become a reality.\n\n\n\nVIRGO was designed to provide full protection in a lightweight piece for people who value both safety and performance. This helmet is suitable for e-bike riding, as well as for regular bike rides. Its design skillfully blends lightweight construction, optimal ventilation, and full facial protection in the event of a head-on collision.\n\n\nMade of a polycarbonate shell with a protective layer of EPS, VIRGO gives you a combination of protection & lightness that keeps up with your activities without compromising on safety, look or performance.\n\n\nThe helmet is specifically designed to fit the safety needs of electric bikes. It\u2019s designed around the new European regulation NTA-8776, which is made for high speeds up to 45 km/h (28 mp/h). It also complies with regular bike regulations EN 1078/CPSC.",
      "With the arrival of electric bikes in our cities, the speed is higher than ever. That\u2019s why you need a helmet designed for better protection. This could mean a slightly heavier, helmet that does its job of providing better protection while still being comfortable while riding. VIRGO offers extra safety as it It follows the hybridization of bicycles by offering much better safety.",
      "Loving the new electric modes of transportation? More speed and less effort means a different level of risk. VIRGO helmet has you covered when you reach high speeds in the wild urban jungle.",
      "Be visible when it gets dark or rainy. A rear LED light placed at the back of the head, that cannot be obstructed by a bag or clothing makes you more visible to drivers, keeping you safer than ever before.",
      "VIRGO is the ideal solution for modern e-bikes, scooters, and powered vehicles, providing enhanced protection and increased visibility beyond what traditional bike helmets offer. What makes this helmet stand out is the safety technology within the shell. Multi-impact protection zones feature in the areas most likely to be hit in a fall.",
      "Should you have an accident and hit your head, the MIPS system in your helmet is designed to help reduce the rotational motion of certain impacts that may otherwise be transferred to your head.",
      "Rotational motion is a common cause of concussions and more severe brain injury in oblique hits to the head. The MIPS system consists of a low friction layer that is mounted inside the helmet. In a crash, the low friction layer is designed to move slightly inside the helmet to help redirect forces away from the head. This is intended to help reduce the risk of brain injury.",
      "Easily attach & remove the LED Tail Light for fast electric bikes with Integrated brake light. It's equipped with a built-in accelerometer that detects braking.",
      "VIRGO comes in four fantastic colors that reflect the latest trends with an edgy palette tailored to urban styles. Choose the perfect match that best fits your style for your daily commute.",

      "Enjoy a perfect fit with our helmet designed in 3 sizes that cover the entire head scope. Get the right size for your head circumference, with sizes S, M, and L.",
      "Experience the ultimate combination of lightness, ventilation, and full-face protection with our helmet. With eight powerful aerations integrated into the shell, this helmet creates channels of air that refresh your head during rides. Weighing in at just 650 grams, it's significantly lighter than a regular integral helmet used for MTB rides.",

      "The chin strap is placed in a way that allows you to drink & fully surrounds the face for shock protection.",
      "2. Shock from below",
      "The helmet lifts up from the back and the face shield protects the face. The forehead remains protected by the shell.",
      "3. Shock from above",
      "The helmet pivots forward and lower the chin bar. The face stays protected and the fitting system reduces the helmet move.",
      "Bicycle helmets are designed to meet two important needs of cyclists. Firstly, they provide necessary protection against potential injuries, and secondly, they are designed to be lightweight to avoid interfering with the physical efforts of the rider. With the addition of facial protection that doesn't add unnecessary weight, the VIRGO helmet provides improved safety for the lower part of the face, without compromising on the cyclist's performance.",
      "The VIRGO adopts a hybrid helmet format that combines the best of full-face and open-face helmets to offer the perfect balance of weight and safety. With a reduced weight of just 650 grams, the helmet provides full-face protection while ensuring exceptional comfort throughout your ride.",
      "When we released a draft version of our project, we received feedback from cyclists and doctors across multiple countries. The level of interest varied depending on the individual experiences and practices of each cyclist, as well as the input from doctors who had treated injuries resulting from cycling accidents. This diverse feedback allowed us to gain a deeper understanding of the needs and concerns of cyclists and doctors in different regions, helping us to refine our project to better meet their needs.",

In the extremely unlikely circumstance that there is an issue with one of our suppliers, we have established relationships with a number of backups, that are of equal quality. We have also implemented a buffer period into our time estimations. This will further ensure that Ghost Yo Yo is delivered on time.",
      "Environmental commitments",
      "Sustainability is a key consideration to all of our designs and something that is very important to us. Wherever possible we have made efforts to reduce the environmental impact of our products. The build quality of Ghost Yo Yo is extremely high making it unlikely to break. With proper maintenance Ghost Yo Yo could last well over a lifetime. All of Ghost Yo Yo's parts can be easily replaced, upgraded or removed. This means that should one of the parts be lost or broken, the whole yo-yo does not need to be disposed. If the project is successful we will be launching many more designs and will have all replacement parts available, if they are needed.",
      "Having parts that can be easily disassembled allows them to be more efficiently recycled, reducing the amount of effort and energy needed to turn them into another product. We have used minimal yet high quality packaging that has been recycled and can be recycled again.",
      "We've been sure to use strong and durable materials that have a very low risk of being damaged. Aluminium is one of the very few materials than can be recycled an infinite number of times without degrading.",

      "Through extensive surveys and personal experiences of our customers, we redesigned the bathrobe to tick every box you can ever dream of.",
      "The Robe 2.0 combines the durability of century-old practices with the performance and versatility of modern-day engineering.",
      "Give yourself something to look forward to after a shower. Wear it in the great indoors or take it to the swankiest of pool parties, hot tubs, and grueling ice baths (if that\u2019s what you\u2019re into)",
      "The Robe 2.0 is the most versatile bathrobe you'll ever use: fast-drying, breathable, and buttery-soft on your skin. It can be worn year-round - keeping you cool in the summer and warm in the winter.",
      "One of the highlights of The Robe 2.0 is its luxurious new fabric. Over 10,000 hours of development time have resulted in a softer, more breathable, and faster-drying weave, made from 100% sustainably-sourced cotton.",
      "Thousands of customers loved our first-ever version of the bathrobe.",
      "The precursor to this project, The Bathrobe Redefined, won the hearts of thousands worldwide. Rated 4.8 from 760 expert loungers on our website. It is still the most funded bathrobe product in the history of crowdfunding.",

      "The Robe 2.0 is designed with the perfect ratio of snug-to-loose. This not only allows for proper airflow to enhance breathability, but it also provides a warm and cozy sensation that has been scientifically proven to elevate levels of melatonin and serotonin. These hormones play a crucial role in improving sleep quality and boosting overall happiness.",

      "Our proprietary design allows you to depress the hinge decal and release your temples which conceal your choice of one of ten different lockpick profiles.",

      "The Covert Optics will be offered in a one size fits all. See Sizes below.",
      "These are subject to change (slightly) but are for the most part going to stay the same. All of these profiles will be in .5mm thickness of 301 full hard (unless we are able to source high yield).",
      "Tension wrenches in the photo will be curved the same direction as the glasses and the photo below is to illustrate the profile sizes.",
      "The Covert Optics will come in a one size fits all standard.",
      "Everything on this page is a prototype and should be scrutinized as such. Our final product will be something that you are very happy with. They will be injection molded and made to perfection so that there is no visible gap between the parts and everything has a smooth finish.",
      "Shipping will be collected after the campaign to avoid uncertain/unforeseeable shipping costs.",
      "If successful the Covert Optics will have additional frame designs that are released in the future so you can just swap them out to your existing hinge joints for a new look. We will also release more picks and optics as the community continues to support the project.",
      "Backer, this goal is a relatively large compared to most campaigns on IndieGoGo. Our hope is that with your help we can spread the word to as many lock picking communities out there as possible. We only intend on running this campaign for a week and a half so time is super important.",

      "EDC Tool Crafted from GR5 Titanium with Innovative Quick-Release, Bolt Action, &Hidden Cutter Design",
      "Have you ever reached for the small tool on your keychain, only to find it buried among bulky keys, causing delays when you need it most?",
      "If you've faced this frustration, then you've arrived at the perfect campaign. Allow us to introduce our latest innovation--The AcePick: the world's first quick-release mini EDC tool, combining a toothpick and a box cutter in one sleek design. With its quick-release structure, you can effortlessly detach it from your keychain with just one hand.",
      "Concerned about the possibility of it getting lost? Fear not! We've preemptively addressed this concern by ensuring that this structure is the most secure ever. Once attached to your keychain, it will stay there securely unless intentionally removed.",
      "When we initially designed this toothpick, it was, of course, to address the awkwardness of having something stuck in your teeth and not having a tool to remove it. However, as our development progressed, we realized that the application of this toothpick extends far beyond that. This sharp little tool can not only serve as a SIM card ejector when you need to retrieve your SIM card but also act as a fork when you're enjoying fruits, help clean dust from crevices, and even double as a latte art needle when you're sipping coffee. Just unlock a world of possibilities for its users.",
      "Moreover, using a metal toothpick is not only more hygienic but also a highly eco-friendly concept. One metal toothpick is equivalent to countless wooden toothpicks and dental floss. We advocate for everyone to adopt more environmentally friendly practices to make our Earth a better place.",
      "Why we combined the toothpick and cutter in one?",
      "Initially, our aim was simply to design a best toothpick in market. We conducted extensive market research and examined all the feedback on the use of metal toothpicks currently available on the market. One common inconvenience users faced was the lack of a quick-release structure. Without it, one had to carry a bunch of keys just to use the toothpick on their keychain, which essentially traded the embarrassment of using fingers to pick teeth for the awkwardness of carrying a bunch of keys.",
      "Additionally, traditional screw-in toothpicks were difficult to clean and easy to lose. Therefore, this time, we applied a bolt-action structure to this toothpick, making it both easy to clean and convenient to use.",
      "Because we implemented the quick-release structure, we were able to add another feature to the other end of the toothpick. What could be more suitable than a mini cutter? Not only does it not increase the size of the product, but it also gives it more powerful functionality.",
      "The hidden cutter offers the ultimate combination of reliability and accessibility for everyday cutting tasks, from box cutting to wire stripping and more.",
      "Due to the unique shape of this mini cutter, it can also serve as a small pry bar. It can easily handle tasks such as cracking nuts, prying out nails, and more in daily use.",
      "Unlock a world of possibilities with the this toothpick multitool. From puncturing cigars to peeling oranges, its utility knows no bounds. And this is just the beginning\u2014more functionalities await your discovery.",
      "Therefore, AcePick is a tool combines the functionalities of wooden toothpicks, a pry bar, knife, and multifunction tool, providing versatility for various tasks.",
      "1 tool=numbers of wooden toothpick+pry bar+knife+multifunction tool",
      "Now, let's talk about the material and size of this tool. First, the material. AcePick is entirely made of GR5 titanium alloy. This material is lightweight, durable, and rust-resistant, making it the perfect choice for a metal toothpick.",
      "Weighing a mere 0.37oz, you'll hardly notice it in your pocket or on your keychain. Make it your perfect EDC companion.",
      "Last but not least, the appearance. This minimalist design makes it not only a practical tool but also a decorative accessory. Whether it's attached to your keychain or worn as a pendant on a necklace, let your imagination guide how you use and carry it.",
      "I'm confident that you now have a thorough understanding of AcePick. If you like it, please support us and be among the first to own an AcePick.",
      "Regarding the reward tiers, we have differentiated only by quantity, with earlier supporters enjoying the lowest prices. If you wish to personalize your AcePick, such as engraving or changing the surface color, you can directly select these options in the add-ons.",
      "Below is the project schedule outlining our plan and timeline. We are set to launch in May and will ensure timely delivery to all backers by August. We are committed to adhering to every step of the schedule and will communicate openly with everyone regarding our progress at each stage.",

      "Combining efficiency, durability, and portability to provide you with a superior coffee grinding experience \u2014 for barista-quality coffee, anywhere you go.",
      "Ever wondered why your cup of coffee at the coffeeshop tastes so much better than what you get at home? We\u2019ll spill the (coffee) beans: A fresh and even coffee grind.",
      "You know, most coffee grinders on the market, especially the cheap ones, come with \u2014 dare we say it \u2014 blade grinders. They work, but will always give you an uneven grind that just doesn\u2019t cut it.",
      "Moreover, pre-ground coffee loses aroma, as the essential fatty acids responsible for rich flavor vaporize over time. That\u2019s why, for a rich coffee flavor, freshly ground coffee is an absolute must.",
      "Even if you have the best coffee machine in the world, if your grind isn\u2019t fresh and even, you\u2019re going to end up with a cup of coffee that just doesn\u2019t come close to barista-quality.",
      "And that\u2019s exactly where Goudveer F1 shines.",
      "The secret behind a great cup of coffee lies in the grind. Goudveer F1 features a patented conical burr grinder (more on that below) in a unique motor-burr system, designed for precision and durability.",
      "Crafted from the highest quality 420 stainless steel with a Rockwell hardness of 50+ HRC, it provides unmatched tensile strength.",
      "And the result? Coffee beans that are always ground to the perfect size \u2014 for a cup of coffee that's full of flavor and depth, just the way you love it.",
      "Goudveer F1 offers both automatic and manual modes for the ultimate coffee-making flexibility. So you get to use the motor module to get your beans ground up with just a press of the button, or snap on the manual grinder add-on and enjoy that super-satisfying manual grinding action.",
      "*Please note that the hand crank comes as an add-on.",
      "You can finally take the taste of barista-brewed coffee anywhere you go. Out camping, traveling, road trips, at the office (excellent for AeroPress) \u2014 or for your daily brew in a cozy corner in your kitchen. It\u2019s battery powered, so you don\u2019t need a power outlet, its portable mini size fits snugly in your hand and your backpack, making it perfect for those on-the-go coffee cravings.",
      "Finetune and get the exact grind you need for any type of coffee \u2014 from course for french press, all the way to the finest grind for a creamy cup of espresso.",
      "With a 48mm five-star conical burr and a 100-level adjustment knob (fine-tune control) \u2014 each level adjusting 0.018 mm (18 microns) \u2014 you can get your coffee grind the way you like it, just like the pros. Anytime, every time.",
      "The Goudveer F1's versatility allows you to enjoy a wide range of coffee styles. Here's a quick guide to help you find the perfect setting for your preferred brewing method:",
      "Remember, these are starting points, and you may want to fine-tune the settings based on your specific taste preferences and the particularities of your coffee beans. The Goudveer F1's precise adjustment capability ensures you can experiment to find your perfect cup!",
      "Thanks to its patented Ultra Stable conical burr design paired with a high RPM stable brushless motor, the Goudveer F1 stands out in its class. It delivers a consistent and evenly distributed grind, crucial for achieving barista-level espresso and pour-over coffee.",
      "This meticulous engineering combats the common issue of channeling \u2014 a pitfall of uneven grind sizes found in other grinders \u2014 that can significantly affect the taste of your coffee. With the Goudveer F1, each brew is a step closer to perfection, free from the inconsistencies that mar the coffee experience.",
      "Battery-operated, this grinder allows up to 35-50 grinding cycles on a single charge. In other words \u2014 that\u2019s an amazing month-long battery life!",
      "No need to hunt for power outlets or deal with annoying power cords ruining your zen. Coffee moments should be happy moments \u2014 and with Goudveer F1, you get to enjoy the freedom of grinding without limits.",
      "Don't you hate it when you have to smack your coffee grinder out after every grind to prevent more and more residue from getting stuck behind? Left behind residue equals bitter coffee, and no one likes bitter coffee \u2014 so Goudveer F1 comes with a direct structure that ensures every bit of the coffee bean is extracted without leaving behind any residue. Now you can focus on making, not smacking, and enjoy maximum flavor.",
      "Experience fully automated grind control with just the press of a button. Set it, forget it, and return to a ready-to-go grind. Plus, you no longer need to worry about damage from a stuck piece of coffee bean. The grinder will automatically stop when a hard foreign chunk gets stuck \u2014 keeping your Goudveer F1 safe and in top condition. For a long time to go.",
      "Enjoy your morning ritual without the distracting noise, and be amazed at how silent a coffee grinder can be. At just 60 dB, the Goudveer F1 operates with such a low hum, it's barely audible. No more disturbing the tranquil morning calm or waking up your family with a loud grinding noise. Turn your morning coffee preparation into a peaceful moment that\u2019s just for you.",
      "With a premium all-aluminum construction in a stunning gold color that will elevate any space, the Goudveer F1 is one that you\u2019ll want to show off. Today, tomorrow, always. It\u2019s a sleek and stylish, timeless statement piece that belongs on your kitchen counter, or wherever you choose to make coffee magic happen.",
      "Nothing beats the superiority of burr grinders. Unlike blade grinders which indiscriminately chop coffee beans resulting in inconsistent grind sizes, burr grinders crush them to a uniform size. This results in a balanced extraction, and ultimately, a better cup of coffee.",
      "And so, at the heart of Goudveer F1 lies our patented burr drive system \u2014 a groundbreaking innovation that sets it apart in the world of coffee grinders. Its unique design ensures horizontal stability by keeping a short distance from the motor to the burr. This significantly reduces burr wobble, which can lead to an inconsistent grind.",
      "This attention to detail positions the Goudveer F1 as a coffee grinder that doesn't just match your expectations, but exceeds them.",
      "Every cup will be a promise of precision, consistency, and most importantly, unmatched flavor. It's not just about making coffee; it's about experiencing the joy of a really good cup\u2026 every, single, time.",
      "Because your coffee deserves more than just a good grind, it deserves the very best.",
      "Time is precious, especially in the mornings when you're rushing to start your day. Wouldn't it be great if your coffee grinder understood that too? Goudveer F1 ensures your coffee beans are ready for brewing in under a minute!",
      "In the time it takes to butter your toast, your coffee beans are ground to your exact preference, ready to brew. Are you ready to embrace a smoother, more efficient morning routine?",
      "Goudveer F1 is built with top-notch materials to ensure it stands the test of time and daily use.",
      "For the grinder, we went with high-quality 420 stainless steel known for its robustness and non-corrosive nature \u2014 with a Rockwell hardness of at least 50 HRC. This means it won't wear out, no matter how much coffee you grind.",
      "As for the body, you get a premium-looking all-aluminum design. Not only does this provide a sleek, modern aesthetic that will complement any environment, it is also incredibly durable, lightweight and easy to handle.",
      "Other grinders might lose their edge with use. But your Goudveer F1 will keep on going. It\u2019s a lifelong companion for your coffee journey.",
      "Not that you\u2019re going to need it very often (month-long battery life, remember?) \u2014 but Goudveer F1 comes equipped with a Type-C fast charging port. So you can charge it up fully in just 30 minutes with any Type-C charger \u2014 even with your power bank. So, whether you're at home, at the office, traveling to your next holiday destination, or camping in the great outdoors, your perfect brew is never more than a quick charge away.",
      "Washing by hand? Don\u2019t bother. Goudveer F1 is dishwasher-safe, and thanks to its detachable design, getting it ready for a wash is as easy as it gets! All you need to do is detach the motor compartment, and toss the rest into the dishwasher. Seriously. It's that easy.",
      "Grinding with Goudveer F1 is as easy as it gets.",
      "The vision for Goudveer emerged in the heart of the Netherlands \u2014 where the rich aroma of coffee beans blends with centuries-old traditions. Surrounded by Amsterdam\u2019s historic streets and overlooking its tranquil canals, our founders were inspired by the weightlessness of a feather and the unmatched luxury of gold. Thus, naming our brand \u201cGoudveer\u201d \u2014 Dutch for Gold Feather.",
      "A symbol of luxuriousness, yet light in form, Goudveer embodies the meticulous Dutch craftsmanship, refined over generations, and the fervent spirit of innovation from the United States. As dusk painted the Dutch skies one evening, our artisans, sipping on a brew that echoed the Netherlands\u2019 profound coffee culture, envisioned a creation that would seamlessly bridge the Atlantic, drawing on the cultural magnificence of both lands.",
      "And so, the Goudveer F1 was born \u2014 a masterpiece that blends Dutch legacy with American ingenuity. Every Goudveer F1 carries with it tales of two nations, harmoniously coming together into a singular, luxurious experience.",
      "As we take you on this transcendent journey through the rich tapestries of our heritage, we invite you to feel the weight of history and the lightness of innovation with every sip you take.",
      "Goudveer F1 campaign is designed and managed by TCF (The Crowdfunding Formula.), a leading, award-winning crowdfunding marketing agency.

My vision for the PUSH UP MACHINE coalesced several years ago when I took my hand drawn sketches to a local product development company. Those drawings evolved into an initial prototype and, after several years of further development, the first official prototype (pictured above).",
      "In the 2010s, social media and crowdfunding did not exist as we know it today. I only had a pending patent and I had no interest in selling the idea, so I shelved the PUSH UP MACHINE. Fast forward to 2017 and things started to happen. I received notice that the patent was allowed, I applied and received an SBA Loan and Indiegogo helped me create a launch pad for the initial go-to-market strategy.",

      "Decades ago, NASA asked specialists to develop the \"smell of space\" to help train astronauts before launch into orbit. NASA's goal of simulating Space during training is to eliminate any surprises Astronauts might experience in Outer Space. Astronauts experience a high G Force Centrifuge simulator for blastoff training, carryout extreme underwater to trainings in Zero G weightlessness for when they reach outer space, and learn what to expect for everything in between. After all, it isRocket Science. The history of the \"Smell of Space\" has been clouded behind various accounts of existence. Ever since the first space walk, astronauts were shocked by the lingering odor when returning back into the spacecraft. Some describe it as gun powder, rum, fruit, seared steak, or a BBQ. The first space tourists also noted a pungent aroma once the hatch opened, 'like burnt cookies'. We had to find out for ourselves...What does space smell like? We dug deep. With a bit of luck (and a beautiful thing called a FOIA request), we found our lead. A perfumer based in the UK. \"The smell of space is so distinct that..NASA reached out to [a fragrance maker] to re-create the odor for its training simulations\". Bingo. Two exclusive commercial contracts later, a secret shelved formula based on verified astronaut accounts, a very large minimum order of fragrance...and we're all off smelling space! We've had Space Ice Cream...this just takes it a small step further. (Or maybe it's a leap for all man kind?)",
      "We've partnered with award winning perfumers, some of the best in the world, and secured the rights to launch this product exclusively. Our team consists of top Fashion, Tech, Design, and Logistics experience--all with a desire to increase interest in STEM fields through experiential education. Click \"Register your School\" below to add your STEM program. Eau de Space is our first product launch under this important initiative, and we hope there will be many more.",

This model, and shoe, was so popular that other large companies like Sketchers were inspired to release shoes in a similar fashion, one of which they named \"Bobs\".",
      "It's a big promise, and isn't the best decision for a company trying to make a profit. But, we really believe in the cause and hope you do too. Imagine if a child that smells Eau de Space today is inspired to become an astronaut, scientist, or engineer. One day, that same child may even become the first human to walk on Mars. That's the kind of impact experiential education has on early teaching programs in the formative years of child development. And it's a really neat mission to be a part of.",

Before owning this title, I had enjoyed my many other titles, such as geek, digital enthusiast, software engineer, testing engineer, etc. In my last job which I worked for over 7 years, I have traveled to almost 10 different countries.

This cube-shaped gaming platform is so unique and they created a special interaction that I\u2019ve never experienced from other gaming systems before. Unfortunately, Sifteo joined 3DR in 2014 and suspended the project. After a very long period of its background & market research, I found the hope along with an opportunity to bring this unique gaming platform back to life and reappear to the user again.

      "An upgraded version of Ragnok gun mouse, tailored for even greater immersion in shooter games.",
      "Over the past few years, Ragnok has dedicated itself to creating realistic and engaging gun mice for shooter game enthusiasts. From the launch of our first-generation MouseGun to the refined second edition, your passion for the MouseGun series\u2014and the countless suggestions and feedback you\u2019ve shared\u2014have driven us to push the boundaries even further.",
      "With ErgoStrike7, we set out on a bold mission: to redefine the gaming mouse. We reimagined its design, upgraded its performance, and fine-tuned every detail of the user experience. The result? A mouse that is more ergonomic, more immersive, and more thrilling than ever before.",
      "Every angle, every button, every feature of ErgoStrike7 has been meticulously crafted to bring you closer to the action. We are confident that it will elevate your gameplay and deliver the most fun you\u2019ve ever had with a gaming mouse.",
      "This is not just a product\u2014it\u2019s the culmination of your trust, your feedback, and our shared love for shooter games. Welcome to the future of FPS gaming- where every shoot starts with ErgoStrike7 in your hands.",
      "Note: The products shown in the following photos and videos are functional prototypes and NOT the final mass-production models. Once the mass-production version is ready, we will update the discussion section immediately. Stay tuned for the latest updates!",
      "Gun + Mouse = Gaming FUN!",
      "Immersion and enjoyment are at the heart of what makes shooter games so captivating\u2014and they\u2019re also one of the key driving forces behind the creation of our revolutionary gun mouse.",
      "We\u2019ve transformed the left-click button into a gun trigger design with a realistic pulling mechanism.",
      "Premium Aluminum Material: Crafted from aluminum and equipped with a Gateron low-profile mechanical blue switch, the trigger delivers an optimal tactile sensation. Built to last, it offers a lifespan of over 50 million clicks.",
      "Perfectly Calibrated Force: Extensive testing has optimized the trigger\u2019s force and travel distance for maximum realism and comfort. This ensures a perfect balance\u2014avoiding response delays from excessive travel or the lack of feedback from too short a distance.",
      "ErgoStrike7 seamlessly merges the functionality of a mouse with the feel of a real firearm. While ensuring practicality and comfort, it provides a grip and operation that closely like a real gun.",
      "ErgoStrike7 introduces an innovative linear motor inside the mouse. Every trigger pull activates the motor to create recoil, delivering the sensation of firing a real weapon.",
      "TITAN Linear Motor: Offers an advanced and highly realistic recoil simulation with faster response times compared to traditional motors. 25G pulse acceleration generated during its oscillating motion, amplifying the tactile feedback for an immersive experience.",
      "Note: The motor in the sample demonstrated in the video produces noticeable noise. We will implement noise reduction measures in the mass production version.",
      "Customizable Feedback: Easily toggle recoil on or off with a top-mounted switch and choose between two adjustable intensity levels.",
      "Balanced Force: Vibration Feedback is meticulously calibrated to maintain shooting accuracy without unnecessary disruption. (slightly pressing down on the trigger enhances targeting precision for optimal performance.)",
      "Place your hand naturally on a surface, and you\u2019ll notice that a slightly tilted vertical position is the most comfortable. This insight inspired the ergonomic design of ErgoStrike7. From clay modeling to 3D printing and continuous testing, the final form has been perfected for your comfort.",
      "The golden angle for ergonomic mice lies between 45\u00b0 and 70\u00b0, with 65\u00b0 being optimal. This tilt minimizes wrist rotation, ensuring a natural hand position and significantly reducing strain during long gaming sessions. It\u2019s easy to adapt to within just a few uses.",
      "The rounded right-side design of ErgoStrike7 ensures a perfect fit for your hand. The soft rubber materials enhances grip comfort, minimizes sweat, and prevents slipping.",
      "It accommodates most hand sizes, with an optimal range of 16\u201321 cm (ideal for users approximately 160\u2013190 cm tall). Note: Measurements may vary depending on hand shape and size, so this is for general reference only.",
      "Designing side button layout for ErgoStrike7 was a challenge. We wanted the trigger, scroll wheel, and side buttons to be easily accessible but not prone to accidental clicks. After numerous refinements, the current layout achieves functionality and aesthetics.",
      "ErgoStrike7 is powered by a top-tier optical sensor, ensuring smooth, precise tracking to enhance your shooting accuracy. DPI Range from 800 to 26,000 allowing you to fine-tune your mouse sensitivity",
      "With the Ragnok's in-house software, you can customize DPI settings, reprogram buttons, and tailor your mouse to your specific needs.",
      "ErgoStrike7 supports wired and wireless connection modes and works seamlessly across PCs, tablets, laptops, and gaming consoles. It\u2019s compatible with various games, ensuring a hassle-free gaming experience.",
      "ErgoStrike7 isn't just a gaming peripheral\u2014it\u2019s a masterpiece of design, technology, and immersion, built for shooter enthusiasts who demand the best. Dive in and feel the difference!",
      "As a gaming mouse, the ErgoStrike7 offers strong compatibility. In addition to PC, laptops, and tablets, it can also connect to gaming consoles, including PS5/PS4/Xbox (for some games, it may requires an adapter).",
      "Testing ErgoStrike7 on Shooter Games\uff1a",
      "Ragnok was established in 2018, driven by a desire to push boundaries in the gaming industry. The founders, passionate gamers themselves, envisioned a mouse that could do more than just control movement\u2014a tool that could enhance the player's connection to the game. This vision gave birth to the first gun-mouse brand for enthusiasts, allowing players to truly immerse themselves in their gameplay.",
      "As the company looks toward the future, Ragnok remains committed to its roots and the spirit of Ragnar\u00f6k, symbolizing transformation and a new world. Ragnok remains committed to refining and developing unique gaming mice and other peripherals. Join us in melding the excitement of virtual worlds with the thrill of real-world \"device\".",
      "First- We're here to connect with you\u2014an incredible community of enthusiastic early-tech adopters. You are at the forefront of new ideas and innovation, and we value your insights and feedback. Besides being the first, you\u2019ll also have access to exclusive perks that won\u2019t be available elsewhere.",
      "Second- Although the initial concept seemed straightforward, bringing this idea to life was far more challenging. Creating a prototype was much more challenging than we initially imagined, with countless iterations and adjustments. Some factories even turned us away, saying that our process was too intricate. But that\u2019s why we\u2019re here\u2014if enough people share our vision and validate the market interest, we\u2019ll have the support we need to make this project a reality.",
      "While unexpected challenges can arise during any production process, we\u2019ve taken steps to minimize potential risks. The tooling for production is already in progress. We are closely monitoring each stage of production to ensure everything stays on track. The first production batch is on schedule to ship by January 2025.",
      "However, delays could occur due to unforeseen issues. Should any delays arise, we are committed to providing transparent and timely updates to our backers, ensuring you stay informed throughout the process. Our goal is to deliver a high-quality product while maintaining realistic timelines",

      "Defrosting frozen ingredients can be frustrating, often accompanied by long waiting times, and improper defrosting methods can lead to the loss of nutrients and diminished flavors.",
      "Defrosting in water can cause ingredients to soften due to water pressure, which may squeeze out juices and result in the loss of nutrients, leading to a dull appearance that affects appetite. Microwaves can cook food unevenly, causing the outside to become overcooked while the inside remains raw. Extended refrigeration can lead to off-flavors and spoilage, prompting us to seek a more efficient solution.",
      "To solve these problems, we have developed the KAYUSO Quick Defrosting Box for you. It uses advanced plasma wind field defrosting technology and UVC sterilization technology, which not only achieves the fastest defrosting but also effectively eliminates 99.99% of bacteria and viruses on the surface of ingredients while ensuring nutrition and taste.",
      "The KAYUSO Quick Defrosting Box can defrost a 1 cm thick steak in just 10 minutes\u2014more than 50 minutes faster than traditional defrosting methods. Whether you want to defrost steaks, fish, chicken, seafood, vegetables, or other ingredients, you can achieve perfect freshness in the shortest time without losing nutrients.",

      "Our advanced touch button interface and LCD display panel make operation simple and intuitive. With a single touch, you can easily start defrosting, freshening, acid removal, and sterilizing all at the same time.",
      "With a 4.2L extra-large capacity and a compact, space-saving design, it is ideal for all types of frozen ingredients.",
      "It makes daily maintenance effortless and is designed for easy cleaning. The convenient rotary handle allows for quick and hassle-free disassembly and washing after use.",
      "KAYUSO Quick Defrosting Box is a great treasure for food lovers and culinary enthusiasts like you, and the ultimate companion for all types of cooking. During the defrosting process, the plasma generator helps the meat to drain acid and eliminate odor, catalyze nutrient conversion, and lock in juices, all of which help to achieve the perfect Maillard reaction easily when frying or grilling.",
      "For you who cook frequently with a tight schedule, it is a home rule changer. It provides a quick and effective defrosting solution for a large number of frozen ingredients, which reduces waiting time for you, maintaining the nutritional quality and taste of your food.",
      "In the fast-paced world of catering, your time is of the essence, and you are more demanding in the taste of ingredients. KAYUSO Quick Defrosting Box significantly speeds up the defrosting process and enhances the tender taste of ingredients, allowing you to efficiently process some high-end quick-frozen ingredients according to your customers' ordering needs.",

This smart defrosting box ensures the ingredients to defrost perfectly every time so that we can enjoy the fun of easy cooking together.",
      "The heavy daily work pressure makes our pace of life very fast, so convenience and immediacy are the keys to us. It not only provides a rapid and effective defrosting solution but also meets our pursuit of high-quality food.",
      "Based on testing, here are the average defrosting times for various types of ingredients with our product:",
      "Attention: When thawing, the food should be flat and ensure the maximum contact area with the chassis to achieve the above thawing speed. If the food is irregular, the thawing time should be appropriately extended.",
      "With its rapid defrosting speed, you won't have to wait long. The UVC sterilization ensures your food is safer and healthier. Additionally, it features a built-in plasma wind field for freshness restoration, which can accelerate the speed of secondary acid removal from meat, eliminate residual odors, catalyze the transformation of high-quality nutrients, and retain moisture and nutrients to the maximum extent.",
      "We randomly invited 35 steak enthusiasts and professional western chefs to defrost steaks using the KAYUSO Quick Defrosting Box, and compared the results of defrosting speed and taste with those achieved by soaking in water and slow defrosting in the refrigerator. Conclusion: Of them, 33 subjects believed that in terms of defrosting speed, the KAYUSO Quick Defrosting Box was indeed faster than soaking in water, and there was less loss of myoglobin on the steak's surface. In terms of taste, steaks defrosted using the KAYUSO box had a better flavor, being sweeter and devoid of a sour taste. In contrast, steaks defrosted by soaking in water or slowly in the refrigerator tended to have a sour taste and were very dry.",

The built-in plasma generator effectively catalyzes secondary acid removal, eliminates residual odors, and maximizes juice retention and nutritional value.",

      "One of the biggest advantages of the Aria scarf is its versatility. It has been designed to have a universal for allowing it to be easily adaptable to any face, from kids to grown-ups. We all know how hard it is to make kids do something, especially when it comes to wearing protective gear. Having an Aria scarf handy is an easy and fun solution to this!",
      "The scarf measures 180 cms x 40 cms and weighs 270g. Featuring a mouldable nosepiece to prevent the scarf from falling down, two discrete earloops for extra flexibility of movement, no filters to change, Aria is fully washable at low temperatures.",
      "Air temperature is largely influenced by the heat coming from the earth's surface rather than the direct Sun's radiation. Therefore in wintertime, the air close to the surface is colder and denser, and it moves slower than warm air. This density means that cold air traps the pollution but also doesn't whisk it away.",
      "Winter air pollution, worsened by heating systems, remains in place for much longer and therefore is breathed in at a higher rate than during the summer.",
      "A scarf is an item most people often carry with them in wintertime, giving a filtering capacity to it, makes it more likely to be used for protection rather than an extra cumbersome item to carry around with you.",
      "Before starting his own projects Alex worked for the most important manufacturer of respiratory protection products in Italy. For four years on his desk, all kinds of protective masks appeared. Whether they were proper industrial PPE or new concepts for fancy Urban Masks that were co-developed together with his company, he really got the chance to see the good and the bad of this particular industry. In his opinion what really lacks in most of these products is a real user-centered approach. Protection is useless if the product you're supposed to wear is uncomfortable or doesn't fit nicely on your face.  With this experience in breathing protection and an out of the box creative thinking together with his project partner Mukti, he started Aria.",

There is a clear focus to highlight various mechanical and design features found on various aircraft from around the world. These special details make the watch look like it's always moving at Mach speed.",
      "The hands of a watch are just as important as the gauges on a fighter jet. They require accuracy and precision in order to convey information concisely. This is why the hands on the Commander Series have contrasting, colored tips for clarity. The custom-cut hands also make it seem like the wearer is staring directly at the instrumentation of their own aircraft.",
      "The aircraft industry is all about innovation and this feature is something wonderfully unique. The traditional second hand of the Commander Series has been scrapped in favor of a second wheel. This wheel moves like the turbine of a plane and propels time forward. Not only is it very functional, but it is seriously cool to look at. Just like flying, time should never be boring.",
      "This feature was designed for the jetsetters and frequent flyers. When traveling between time zones, it is easy to lose track of time, particularly whether it is AM or PM. That\u2019s where the Commander Series\u2019 24-hour indicator comes in. By showing the hour of the day, time never eludes the wearer.",
      "Curves are beautiful and aerodynamic. The front glass of our newest watch aims to make the wearer feel like a pilot. The smooth curve of the glass as it blends seamlessly with the body of the watch mimics the cockpit canopy found on aircraft. Who says pilots always have the best views?",
      "Mechanics in motion is magical. The Commander Series features layer upon layer of intricate, mechanical parts all moving in perfect harmony. Just like with the exposed engines of vintage aircrafts, the wearer will be able to see each carefully-considered piece of the Miyota 82S7 that brings life to this timepiece .",
      "A watch must make a statement at all times. Taking into consideration comments from our AIRSPEED project backers, we have ensured that this watch glows in the dark. The night helps the Commander shine with the Super Luminous added to the hands and hour markers of our watch. Telling time in the dark is now a breeze.",
      "The design of a watch does not stop at its face. Our carefully crafted straps ensure that the overall color scheme of the watch has a complete look. However, we know that taste is not uniform, so we have made our straps easily detachable for extra customizability. At a lug width of 22mm, just about any watch strap can be used in conjunction with the Commander Series.",
      "Our previous timepiece, AIRSPEED, did not allow the wearer to service the watch easily. Taking this feedback into consideration, we have now introduced a screw-back design that allows wearers to access the watch\u2019s internal adjustments as required.",

      "What's not to love about guitar? They produce good sound quality but require proper care to keep them safe from bumps and drastic weather changes. It also needs regular tuning and maintenance to last you a long time.",
      "Among countless materials available, carbon fiber has the characteristics of being lightweight, has good strength, and boasts extreme durability. When these attributes are applied to a guitar, everything becomes a perfect combination. We hope to create a compact, versatile, and powerful guitar to accompany you every step of the way.",
      "Before launching on Kickstarter, we have successfully conducted several production tests and verified its design and manufacturability. We currently have a ready-to-deliver batch stored in our warehouse so this means you don't have to worry about shipping delays or long delivery times. Once the crowdfunding campaign is over, we will ship Joytar to you as soon as possible. Prepare to be blown away and take your musical experience to the next level.",
      "Joytar is entirely made of aerospace-grade carbon fiber and wrapped with unidirectional carbon fabric. Get ready for the world's lightest yet powerful guitar.The revolutionary one-piece molding technology makes the guitar a natural fit and more comfortable to hold. This unique structure minimizes sound quality loss, offers uniformed resonance, and delivers fuller sound.",
      "The patented Power Nest\u2122 acoustic beam structure was developed through extensive professional tests to ensure its finest results. The carbon fiber rod and prepreg are integrated to form an extremely thin yet sturdy guitar panel.Joytar's panel has an average thickness of only 1mm. The ultra-thin panel brings unparalleled resonance to the guitar. With just a slight pluck, Joytar generates a crisp, natural, and rich sound.The most important thing a guitarist needs to have in their arsenal is an excellent guitar. If you feel tired from long playing sessions, then it is time to change for the better.",
      "We have thoroughly experimented and designed an ergonomically defined double waist of Joytar's body that turns hard angles into soft curves. The guitar's body and neck are combined as a whole for effortless playability during long sessions.The curvature profile of the neck is designed with parametric modeling to make it extra intuitive. Whether you are a novice guitarist or an experienced musician, Joytar is your everyday partner for a seamless play.",
      "The strings are professionally tuned with the perfect string height of 2.1mm* to press down the strings smoothly. The high-quality construction of the neck makes it the most durable guitar you'll ever own.The frets are carefully assembled from nickel alloys and the rounded edges are redesigned with industrial production molds. This state-of-the-art craftsmanship ensures that you'll get a comfortable playing experience every time you pluck the string.",
      "We've established a cooperative relationship with the world-renowned pickup company, Double. Based on the internal cavity structure of Joytar, we've successfully designed and built a powerful pickup module.",
      "Without connecting to the speakers, you can get special sound effects such as delay, reverberation, or vibration. Here is the video of",
      "Reverb Off  and Reverb On: Like rock or jazz? Joytar is your ideal choice! The pickup module supports Bluetooth connection so you can import beats from your phone or record and play audio tracks through Garageband. Setting up a band-like performance has never been easier! (Bluetooth connection is applicable for iOS and Android)Joytar weighs only 3.3 lb, which is equivalent to a 13-inch MacBook Pro.",
      "The 36-inch travel-sized guitar can be easily brought onto the plane or placed in your car's trunk. Whether it is a road trip with your family or a regular outing with your friends, Joytar is designed to go wherever life takes you.",
      "Joytar is a guitar that does not require tuning and maintenance. As carbon fiber is extremely durable, it can withstand a pressure of 154 lb (70 kg), so Joytar does not require complicated rod adjustments. Whether in a hot, humid rainforest or cold, snowy winter, Joytar is designed to withstand extreme weather conditions.",

      "Joytar is designed based on the concept of sustainability. As we know that trees are at risk of extinction, Joytar uses carbon fiber to replace traditional wood and reduce deforestation. We guarantee that the spraying and assembly processes of the entire production are in strict compliance with environmental protection standards.",
      "Carbon fiber guitars might have been in the industry for years, but they only reach a niche target. The reason is that production barriers are high, the process is complicated and the efficiency is low, resulting in increased costs and prices. The Joytar team uses its own technology and experience to optimize and improve the existing production process continuously.",
      "It took 20 months to create a production technology with completely independent property rights. This technology has the features of high efficiency, convenience, and easy standardization which meet the requirements of industrialization and large-scale production. The characteristics of manufacturing lay a solid foundation for promoting carbon fiber guitars and judging from the finalized products that have been produced, the design requirements are perfectly fulfilled.",

At this time, you may also make changes on your size selection or specify if you would like multiple sizes with your order.",

      "My posture was getting worse sitting at work hunched over my computer. I knew there was a better way to work on my posture than the traditional stiff and painful trainers that bruised my shoulders and armpits.",
      "As a Biomedical Engineer, I've worked on complex devices like artificial heart valves, tracheostomy devices and surgical aid tools. So I knew I needed to use my design experience to make something that could help my back. Once I started seeing the positive changes on my back, I started trying it on everyone I could find, my mom, her friends, my friends, even an astronaut. :)",

      "One of the first things that surprised me is that most people trying CoreXO got a back crack in the first wear. This was encouraging as it showed CoreXO really makes an impact on back alignment and tension relief.",
      "I also heard people say one of the big reasons they don't wear a traditional trainer is because they\u2019re bulky and don\u2019t scream confidence when worn in public.",

      "MANUFACTURING: We have a few potential manufacturers lined up with the quality and sustainability requirements that are important to us. However, these have high minimum order quantities which we can only meet smoothly if we meet our campaign goal. We are still planning on placing the minimum order regardless, however, it will require additional time to secure financing elsewhere.",
      "FULFILLMENT: Sometimes stuff happens that can\u2019t be planned for, a supplier misses a deadline or a shipment gets lost. Those factors could cause delays in the time it gets for you to get your product. To mitigate this, we are using an experienced logistics team to get your product to you in the most timely manner.",
      "We\u2019ll keep open and honest communication with you through our process so you know where your product is in the production process and when it\u2019s going to get to you. We will post regular updates on the Indiegogo discussion channel, emails, our facebook group and our youtube channel (see post-campaign email for links to these).",

      "Turn your phone into a performance polarizing microscope with this tiny lens accessory",
      "We did our best and made some progress on the project last month. We are glad to update you on the progress of the project and the shipment.",
      "Production update",
      "We ran a final pilot production for the focus stand samples and started mass production at the end of June. Although mass production takes more time than expected, we received enough focus stand products in the middle of July. Here are the final products.",
      "Once all the parts and materials were ready, we started assembling. We have been busy assembling the products and checking the quality during the last weeks. Here are the iMicro Deluxe products ready to ship.",
      "Shipment progress",
      "We have over 4000 parcels to process. We sent almost 2000 parcels (about 40%) to our carrier (China Post). Here are some of the parcels before we send them to our carrier. The carrier will take one to two weeks to process the parcels and get the tracking number live online. We expect to send the rest of 60% parcels to our carrier before the end of August. After",
      "We estimated to finish the shipment for most of the Kickstarter backers at the end of August, 2022. So we can start shipping for Indiegogo backers in September 2022.",
      "From 2018 to 2020, we took Kickstarter and Indiegogo by storm with the Fingertip Microscopes - iMicro Q, iMicro C, and iMicro Q2, earning 20K pledges from the community over 40K iMicros delivered to our backers in over 70 countries. It is a breakthrough in portable microscopy - we're pretty proud, and thank you all for your support.",
      "We keep improving and polishing the iMicros, and we never stop - now we've taken our effort one step further and are pleased to bring you the new fingertip microscope - iMicro Q2p, the first smartphone microscope with polarizing function.",
      "Since Antony van Leeuwenhoek invented his microscope in the 17th century, microscope technology has progressed tremendously. Microscopes with excellent performance are usually bulky, heavy, and expensive, even for portable ones. With our years of effort, what we introduced in 2018 - the fingertip microscope iMicro Q - is a real breakthrough in mobile microscopy. It has the comparable optical performance to a professional desktop microscope and enables you to carry it with you as easily as you bring your phone. In addition to the iMicro Q's excellent optical performance and portability, we launched iMicro Q2 in 2020 with enhanced compatibility to work with any smartphone.",
      "Polarized light is a contrast-enhancing technique that improves the quality of the image obtained with birefringent materials, such as crystals, minerals, liquid crystals, and plastics. The polarized light microscope (polarizing microscope) is designed to observe and photograph specimens primarily due to its optically anisotropic character. Usually, a polarized light microscope is much more expensive and only available for professionals. Now with iMicro Q2p, in addition to the function of a typical biology microscope, we bring you this tiny Fingertip Microscope with the fantastic polarizing function.",
      "Here are some micrographs taken with iMicro Q2p (using an iPhone 11):",
      "Here are more example micrographs with polarizers and without polarizers - solid proof that the polarizing function dramatically enhanced the contrast with rich colors.",
      "The first smartphone polarizing microscope",
      "To our knowledge, iMicro Q2p is the first smartphone microscope with the polarizing function integrated with such a small profile.",
      "Improved focusing control with the focusing stand",
      "Our previous backers queried a lot on a focusing stand/support to the fingertip microscopes. We listen to our backers, and we have worked hard on designing a convenient, flexible, intuitive stand to allow precision focusing. Finally, we have a satisfactory solution.  It works very well and is also simple to use.",
      "It has the same high magnification as iMicro Q and Q2. Here are the micrographs of the fiber from one dental floss. If you don't have a microscope, you don't know it has such a fine structure on this fiber. It is amazing!",
      "Very high resolution",
      "Resolution is more important than magnification when speaking about the performance of a microscope. The USAF 1951 resolution test chart was used to test the resolution of iMicro Q2p on an iPhone 11. The intervals between the finest test bars are 2.19 micrometers. The finest test bars on the 7th group are clearly seen, indicating its resolution is far beyond that.",
      "Very low distortion",
      "We used a grid calibration target to test the distortion. Even in full view at the edge of the visual field, no noticeable distortion was observed.",
      "Extremely low profile",
      "It is about the size of a fingertip and weighs only 0.5g (~1/60 oz). It is very thin, only 3.2mm (1/8 inch). No parts extrude beyond the edge of your phone when it is installed. Also, the focusing stand has not increased the profile regarding the whole pack - still in the card size and easily fit in a wallet.",
      "Affordable to every budget",
      "We are very proud of the Fingertip Microscope and would like everyone to be able to afford it. With a polarizing function, we can still keep it at a low cost. With the money you would need to buy a traditional desktop microscope, you could purchase many Fingertip Microscopes, making this a great option for children and students.",
      "Works with any smartphone",
      "As iMicro Q2 lens and iMicro C lens, we design iMicro Q2p in a tiny round style to fit any phone with a camera. They will be coupled to your smartphone by an innovative, re-useable, nano-suction pad. Whether your phone has a single back camera or multiple back cameras, a flat camera(s), or extruded camera(s), these tiny round lenses will fit well with them.",
      "The magnification",
      "The magnification mainly relies on its complex optical system for traditional compound microscopes, including objective and eyepiece. Its total magnification is a combination of the magnification of objective and eyepiece.",
      "For our fingertip microscope, three stages of magnification are combined to achieve the total magnification. First, the lens provides optical magnification to generate the image on the smartphone camera's sensor; second, the image on the sensor is displayed on the much larger screen via the electronic process and magnification; third, digital zoom provides further magnification as a digital magnification to the image. The total magnification is a combination of these three.",
      "The traditional polarizing microscope has a complex structure. Especially a polarizer and another polarizer (analyzer) are added before and after the specimen in the optical system. For iMicro Q2p, we mimic this polarizing structure but keep it in a small profile.",
      "Development path and process",
      "We have walked a long way to develop these smartphone-based microscopic tools since registering the first patent in 2012. We have already successfully built a series of smartphone microscope products, including iMICROSCOPE, iMICROSCOPE R, and the \u03bcRuler, iMicro Q, iMicro C, iMicro Q2, as well as this new version iMicro Q2p.",
      "We have shaped and polished our Fingertip Microscope idea according to previous backers' and customers' suggestions and comments based on our previous successful projects. We have optimized the optics and the overall design, and each step was tested and refined using prototypes to achieve the best performance possible.",
      "Structure detail",
      "Stress-free multi-element aspherical micro-lens with polarizer integrated",
      "The lens is a crucial component of the system. A small ball lens (van Leeuwenhoek) is a straightforward approach. But it is well known to suffer from a very limited usable field of view due to severe field curvature effects, spherical and other aberrations. The iMicro Q2p uses a more complex multi-aspherical lens design and integrated polarizer to achieve high magnification performance and low aberration with polarizing function.",
      "Innovative illumination: Reflection/transmission lighting with polarizer",
      "In iMicro Q2p, we incorporated a new reflection/polarizing/transmission lighting. The thin PP case is not only used to pack and protect the product but also used as a light-reflective illumination box. The light from the flashlight and ambient light goes to the bottom of the lighting box and is reflected from the thin PP case's bottom wall to illuminate the sample after being polarized.",
      "Seamless coupling with the smartphone: Nano-suction pad attachment",
      "Unlike conventional adhesive, the nano suction pad mimics gecko's footpads: it has thousands of micro air pockets functioning like micro-suction cups to hold the device to the phone.",
      "Every on and off application will leave nothing on the phone. This newly developed \"nano suction pad\" is residue-free, non-tacky, and repeatable. The use of a nano suction pad has been proved in our previous product, and it is repeatable and easily cleaned by a PSA tape (such as Scotch tape).",
      "Easy focus with focusing stand",
      "We believe you will like this focusing stand - it works very well and keeps a low profile. It is made of engineering plastic (PMMA, acrylic resin) and is strong enough with durability. It is also very simple and easy to set up to use. After using it, you can disassembly it and store it in the thin PP case.",
      "\u03bcRuler and Dedicated App: for professional needs",
      "A high-quality \u03bcRuler M (stage micrometer) will be provided with iMicro Q2p to calibrate the scale-bar in our App, i-Seeing, and enable you to measure size accurately. Please see our previous campaign, \u03bcRuler- A micro-ruler to measure micro-objects, for more information. \u03bcRuler Q will be available as an add-on.",
      "iMicro Q2p actually works with any camera App which can control the flashlight when shooting or you provide illumination with an extra torch. In some cases, it is crucial to have a scale-bar and ensure its accuracy on the micrograph. The dedicated App, i-Seeing, was designed to take micrographs to meet professional demand. The scale-bar on the micrograph can be toggled on/off to enable you to embed a scale-bar on the image if required.",
      "It is super portable, and you don't need complicated settings, so you can immediately take images, use them for reporting and transferring images to your colleagues. Plus, you can use it with any smartphone. It can be used in many professions where you need accurate images and easily accessible research photographs in the field.",
      "Many of our previous backers shared their application with beautiful and unique pictures when using the fingertip microscopes. Here are a few examples. Many of them are from our previous backers' photos with the iMicro Q2 and iMicro C on their phones; Some of them are our test photos for the polarizing function. With the polarizing function, you will have more power for its application.",

We incorporated the word, \"anywhere\" into it and created the brand name, \u201cAnymaka\u201d which means, \u201ca stretch of cloth that can go anywhere\u201d. And that becomes our mission: to bring that chill hammock vibe to any spot you want to hang out.",
      "To make this happen, we quickly built an engineering team based in China and Hong Kong working closely with our manufacturers. Our intense two-year product development process was filled with prototyping, testing, and relentless redesigning. We were on a mission to make our hammock stand lighter, tougher, and a breeze to pack.",
      "This was our very first prototype. It couldn't even handle the weight of a little kid. In the coming months, we tried tweaking and refining it and went through multiple iterations.",
      "In the end, we had to ditch the entire initial design. It hit us hard as we had poured so much time and effort into it.",
      "Deciding to carry on, a second concept was built. With a more robust design, enhanced portability, and smoother operation, it became the foundation of our future improvements.",
      "We kept pushing forward, continuously refining and iterating upon this fundamentally solid design. We put it to the test, pushing its load-bearing capacity to the limits. Throughout this process, we also focused on perfecting our sunshade design, striving for the ultimate goal of being lightweight, using minimal fabric, ensuring maximum stability, making it easy to set up, and achieving the best possible sunshade effect.",

      "The idea for the AllPro Ruler began over a year ago with a simple yet ambitious goal: to create the lightest, thinnest, highest-quality ruler packed with the most features. Traditional rulers often serve basic measurement purposes and lack the ability to measure depth, diameter, and more. During our initial sketches and brainstorming sessions, we were determined to include all these essential functions\u2014ruler, caliper, protractor, compass, and more.",
      "After months of refining the concept and testing various designs, we created a tool that goes beyond basic functionality. The AllPro Ruler not only measures length but also offers a range of features that make it incredibly versatile for any situation. From measuring depth and diameter to drawing precise angles and circles, this ruler combines multiple tools into one sleek, portable design. Every detail was carefully considered to ensure that it meets the highest standards of quality and usability.",
      "Keep reading to discover the full potential of the AllPro Ruler.",
      "At the heart of the AllPro Ruler is its construction from Gr5 titanium \u2013 a material renowned for its incredible strength-to-weight ratio, corrosion resistance, and durability. Gr5 titanium ensures that the AllPro Ruler is not only lightweight but also incredibly tough, able to withstand the rigors of daily use without compromising on performance. This premium material choice guarantees that your ruler will remain as reliable as the day you first held it, no matter where your adventures take you.",
      "Weighing in at just 14.9 grams, the AllPro Ruler is featherlight, making it easy to carry with you wherever you go. Its ultra-slim profile means it slips effortlessly into your pocket or bag, ready to be deployed at a moment's notice. Despite its lightweight and slim design, the AllPro Ruler doesn't sacrifice functionality \u2013 it's a powerhouse tool packed with features that deliver on every front.",
      "The AllPro Ruler is designed for maximum versatility and convenience, making it easy to carry and use in various situations. While traveling, store it in your carry-on for quick access. For everyday use, slip it into your pocket\u2014its slim design ensures it won\u2019t take up much space. If you need extra protection, place it in the included sleeve to keep it safe from scratches. It even doubles as a bookmark when reading or studying, ensuring you always have a reliable tool on hand. Wherever you are, the AllPro Ruler fits effortlessly into your life, offering exceptional portability and functionality.",
      "Comfort was a priority in the design of the AllPro Ruler, which is why we not only meticulously rounded the edges to prevent sharp corners but also crafted the entire ruler with a slight trapezoidal shape. This subtle design feature makes it easier to grip, providing a more secure and comfortable hold. Whether you're measuring, drawing, or simply handling the tool, the combination of smooth edges and ergonomic shape ensures a pleasurable and effortless experience, even during extended use.",
      "Precision is key, and the AllPro Ruler delivers with finely etched measurements that are clear and easy to read. Whether you need metric or imperial units, we've got you covered \u2013 simply choose the version that suits your needs. The markings are laser-engraved to ensure they won't fade over time, providing you with reliable accuracy for years to come. The AllPro Ruler transforms the simple act of measuring into an experience of unparalleled precision.",
      "Unlike traditional rulers that start measuring from the edge, the AllPro Ruler is designed to start from zero. This feature allows you to measure depth with pinpoint accuracy, making it perfect for tasks that require precise measurement from the very beginning. No more guessing or estimating \u2013 with the AllPro Ruler, you can trust that every measurement is exact, right from the start.",
      "The AllPro Ruler doubles as a caliper, enabling you to measure diameters and thicknesses with ease. This built-in feature is perfect for anyone who needs to measure round objects, pipes, or any item where diameter matters. With the AllPro Ruler, you have the precision of a caliper at your fingertips, ensuring that every measurement is as accurate as possible.",
      "With the AllPro Ruler, creating perfect circles has never been more effortless. Thanks to our innovative design, the ruler allows you to draw circles of any size with precision and ease. Using the Push-Pin Mechanism, you can securely fix one end of the ruler, and by adjusting the built-in button, you can set the exact diameter you need. Whether it's for detailed drawings or precise measurements, the AllPro Ruler makes it simple and accurate to draw circles of any diameter.",
      "The Push-Pin Mechanism is a game-changer when it comes to drawing circles. Unlike traditional methods where you need a separate tool to fix one side, this integrated push-pin allows you to stabilize the center of the circle with just your finger. This not only makes the process faster but also eliminates the need for extra tools, ensuring you can draw clean and stable circles with minimal effort. It\u2019s designed for portability and ease, giving you a simple yet effective solution for drawing circles anywhere.",
      "Many rulers on the market use a fixed-point and pre-drilled holes to draw circles. While this may work for a few specific sizes, it greatly limits flexibility. These fixed-diameter options aren\u2019t truly convenient, as you're stuck with the predefined sizes of the holes. With the AllPro Ruler, we\u2019ve solved this problem by integrating an adjustable button mechanism. This allows you to smoothly set any diameter you need, from small to large circles, without restriction. Whether you're sketching small details or large arcs, the adjustable system ensures that you\u2019re never limited by fixed measurements, offering true versatility and precision.",
      "Need to measure or draw angles? The AllPro Ruler integrates a protractor right into its design, featuring clear markings every 15 degrees, covering a full 180-degree range.",
      "With two-point positioning, this feature enables you to measure and draw angles quickly and accurately. It's the perfect tool for architects, engineers, designers, or anyone needing precise angles. Whether you're creating new angles or verifying existing ones, the AllPro Ruler\u2019s protractor ensures flawless precision every time.",
      "One of the standout features of the AllPro Ruler is its ability to not only draw precise circles and angles but also seamlessly create rounded corners\u2014a crucial element in design and engineering work.",
      "This dual functionality allows you to create both small and large-radius corners with ease, offering unparalleled control and flexibility. Whether you're working on detailed technical drawings, architectural blueprints, or design projects, the AllPro Ruler's versatility simplifies complex tasks that would otherwise require multiple tools.",
      "The ability to transition smoothly between drawing circles, angles, and rounded corners makes the AllPro Ruler an indispensable tool for professionals and hobbyists alike. Say goodbye to the hassle of switching between different instruments\u2014with the AllPro Ruler, everything you need is in one sleek, efficient design.",
      "For those who work in low-light conditions, the AllPro Ruler includes a tritium slot that allows you to insert a tritium tube or glass luminous tube for visibility in the dark.

The tension peaked as my wife presented the latest electricity bill with soaring energy costs. It was this all-too-common scenario that sparked a realization: we needed a solution that could offer personalized cooling without contributing to excessive energy consumption. Thus, the Silent Cicada was born, embodying the belief that \"Comfort is Personal.\" Echoing Elon Musk's sentiment, \"Personalization is the future,\" we're set to redefine the air conditioning landscape, much like Steve Jobs transformed the personal computer industry.",

With a charging time that's shorter than the usage time per charge, you can use one battery while the other charges. This way, as soon as one battery depletes, a fully charged one is ready to replace it.",
      "Operating the device is straightforward: simply secure the cooling unit around your wrist, snap on the power unit, and you're ready to experience the cooling effect. For a more comprehensive guide, please refer to the video below:",

It boasts significant advantages including lower costs, zero maintenance, reduced power consumption, and enhanced mobility.",

In contrast, our Personal Aircon outperforms these alternatives without question, offering both safety and convenience.",

      "Effectiveness Showcase 2: Watch Personal Aircon swiftly cool a user's arm from 97\u00b0F (36 \u00b0C)to 93\u00b0F (34\u00b0C) in just 3 minutes, as captured by an infrared camera (time-lapse video).",
      "2. Heat Relief Activation: By stimulating natural heat relief processes and arteriovenous anastomoses (AVAs) in areas prone to efficient cooling like palms and wrists, and integrating Traditional Chinese Medicine practices by activating the \"Waiguan\" acupuncture point, the device efficiently dissipates heat.",
      "In essence, the Silent Cicada Personal Air Conditioner provides a nuanced and scientifically informed approach to personal cooling, prioritizing safety, effectiveness, and the enhancement of the body's natural cooling responses.",
      "We conducted a BLIND test to evaluate the ambient temperature perception using both functional (FD) and non-functional (NFD) Silent Cicada personal air conditioner. Participants recorded their perceived room temperature after stabilizing for 5 minutes, then swapped devices and repeated the process. On average, the Personal Aircon effectively reduces the perceived temperature by 3.6\u00b0F (2\u00b0C ) for users.",
      "In a separate study, we assessed Silent Cicada\u2019s impact on office thermal comfort using Berkeley's survey format, with 24 volunteers, ages 18-63, evenly divided by gender. Based on the survey results, more participants preferred the 82\u00b0F (28\u00b0C) setting with Silent Cicada over the standard 79\u00b0F (26\u00b0C) setting, with women reporting higher satisfaction, indicating gender-specific thermal preferences.",
      "These experiments underscore Silent Cicada\u2019s role in enhancing thermal comfort and workplace productivity while suggesting potential for energy conservation and environmental benefits by enabling higher indoor temperature settings comfortably. By simple calculations, our Personal Aircon offers a daily saving of S$2.10 and a reduction in carbon emissions of about 2.57 kg.",
      "Lowering muscle temperature is key to reducing muscle fatigue and boosting athletic performance. Cold water immersion helps alleviate post-exercise stiffness, but preventing muscle fatigue during activities remains a challenge. The Silent Cicada Personal Aircon could be a solution by effectively delaying muscle overheating during exercise. This allows athletes to enhance performance by managing heat accumulation in real-time, ensuring peak efficiency throughout their activities.",
      "10 Volunteers, Ages 12-40, conducted test activities including running (distance covered in 2 minutes), dumbbell lifting (number of times a 2.5KG dumbbell was lifted), and hand gripping (number of times a 2KGF grip was achieved), with and without Personal Aircon.",
      "Findings: Utilizing the Silent Cicada Personal Aircon led to improved exercise performance, with a 2% increase in 2-minute running distance, 19% more dumbbell lifts, and a 17% boost in grip endurance. These results indicate the device's potential to enhance resistance training by positively impacting fatigue response, especially when positioned closer to the target muscle group.",
      "Recent studies have shed light on a crucial yet often overlooked factor affecting the learning environment: temperature. These studies reveal that for every 1\u00b0F increase in temperature over the course of a school year, there's a corresponding 1% decrease in the amount learned.",
      "100 volunteers, aged 18 to 25, played a maze game of the same difficulty level twice; once with a non-functional device and again with a functional Silent Cicada device, without knowing which was which (blind test). Based on the statistics, the Personal Aircon notably enhanced focus, improving test performance by an average of 5.2% faster. 70% of participants experienced a speed increase, with the most significant improvement at 25.3%.",
      "Additionally, 10 volunteers, aged 18 to 25, solved 50 math questions of Primary 3 level twice, under the same conditions as the previous test, including the blind test format with non-functional and functional devices. Surprisingly, 80% of the participants showed faster completion times, with all participants either improving or maintaining their accuracy on the questions when using the Personal Aircon.",
      "These results indicate that the Silent Cicada can significantly boost focus and efficiency in academic or work environments, offering substantial benefits to those who find it challenging to sustain concentration. Although the Silent Cicada does not directly enhance IQ, our research suggests it may significantly contribute to higher test scores.",
      "Our cutting-edge Personal Aircon is at the forefront of personal cooling technology, with patents granted in some countries and a crucial patent pending in the USA. This highlights our commitment to innovation and protecting our unique technology on a global scale.",
      "FCC compliance refers to the adherence to regulations set forth by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the United States. It ensures our Personal aricon  meeting health and safety standards related to electromagnetic exposure.",
      "Currently, our pilot production lines are operational. The casings have been 3D printed, and both the PCBs and batteries have been manufactured. We anticipate that the first batch of products for early backers will be completed by mid-May and ready for shipping at the campaign's conclusion.",
      "Our Personal Aircon offers flexible cooling beyond its main function, however, caution is advised for those with health conditions such as high blood pressure or cardiovascular diseases. Applying cooling near the neck may interfere with natural temperature regulation, potentially causing discomfort. Overcooling can lead to increased calorie burning, risking symptoms like dizziness. Discontinue use if discomfort arises. Our aim is safe, enjoyable personal cooling, considering health and well-being.",

      "Scribit is the write & erase robot that allows you to draw any content sourced from the web",
      "CREATED BY MIT PROFESSOR CARLO RATTI, SCRIBIT IS a small \"writing robot\" that can draw images and text on any vertical surface.",
      "What if you could instantly turn your office or living room wall into a canvas for digital content, and update it in real time?",
      "A restaurant can post the day\u2019s menu on its wall, professionals can support their focus by writing new motivational sentences every day, or someone who loves art can draw on a Van Gogh -- or their own drawings \u2013 onto their bedroom wall.",
      "Scribit is also an amazing way to entertain the attendees of a live event. We accomplished this in January at CES 2019, the world's leading Consumer Electronics event.",
      "Scribit can operate between 4 colours combinations.",
      "Along with Scribit you'll receive 24 default colours.",
      "The 4 default colours are Red, Grenn, Blue and Black (the Primary colours).",
      "Thanks to a special patented technology, Scribit can safely draw, erase and re-draw new content an infinite number of times, allowing you to print a different image on your wall every few minutes.",
      "How does this work? The little pod highlighted above can heat up to 149 F\u00b0. As simple as that: it will run across the design and the ink of the marker will evaporate little by little.",
      "Scribit uses 2 wheels to climb (almost) any type of vertical surface.  Whiteboards, glass and standard plaster are the surfaces we recommend to obtain the highest quality drawings.",
      "Scribit can be installed in less than 5 minutes: all that is needed are two nails and a power plug. It can place itself at any point with great precision and uses markers to reproduce any type of content.",
      "Easy enough for everyone. Cool enough to entertain your friends.",
      "The Scribit App is designed to allow you to seamlessly browse through a sea of content from Artists, Illustrators and developers, anywhere in the Web.",
      "It's a unique way to interact with your friends by sharing drawings, fun facts or notes that can appear on your wall in just a few minutes.",
      "You can receive updates or news about your favorite topics, or other practical information such as weather forecasts or grocery lists, without having to look at your mobile phone.",
      "Scribit will offer users access to a broad range of digital content structured around mini Apps. In this global marketplace, people, businesses or institutions \u2013 from artists, to museums, to media organisations - can develop and upload any type of content.",
      "Imagine if you could reconfigure your walls every day. You might draw on masterpieces from the best museums of New York, Paris or Tokyo, or discover the latest works by emerging artists.",

      "When you're ready, you'll send it to Scribit via Web browser (like Chrome or FireFox) with one of the extensions above.",
      "Yes, Scribit is a robot. It is 6.6 inch x 3.15 inch in dimension and covered in aluminum on the outer part. The core of its technology is a rotative engine that allows to be in writing or stand-by position, beside changing color when the drawing requires it.",
      "It's quite small, but big enough to be noticed when in action.",
      "The LED strip on the top is Scribit's way to communicate with you. According to the color of the light and if it'll be pulsing or flashing, you'll be able to understand whether Scribit is busy, resting or loading a new drawing.",
      "After showcasing the first concepts back in 2012, the development of Scribit has been accelerated starting from September 2017.",

      "Remotely access in-home network and streaming services from anywhere you go",
      "Are you an expat and streaming lover? Do you own a Firestick or Apple TV? Are you a modern cord cutter? AlwaysHome is the right tool for you to take your streaming subscriptions to anywhere you go in the world. It connects your streaming devices like Phone, Computer, Firestick, Apple TV or even Smart TV to streaming subscriptions such as Netflix, Hulu or Amazon from anywhere in the world.",
      "With a home proxy set up at home, you can access the in-home network from anywhere you go and access in-home streamings from Xfinity, Spectrum, Verizon TV, etc.",
      "If you have a streaming device like Apple TV or Xbox that need to connect to streaming subscriptions, you can use AlwaysHome companion dongle. The dongle is a customized mini Wi-Fi router that is plug & play and portable. It is super easy to use, just connect it to network and wait for its four lights turned on, then you have a new Wi-Fi hotspot in the room. Then connect your Wi-Fi enabled streaming devices like Apple TV, PS4, Xbox, Phone, Tablet, Computer etc to it and then open up your favorite streaming Apps on those devices to enjoy your favorite shows from anywhere in the world.",
      "If you travel light or prefer to do everything from computer/phone/ipad, AlwaysHome App all you need. The App is designed to connect your mobile devices to subscriptions without using the dongle. On your devices, just download, run and click to connect AlwaysHome App and then go ahead to open the streaming Apps to enjoy your favorite shows from anywhere in the world. It is that simple. This App runs on Android, Windows, iOS, Mac and Fire OS. (AlwaysHome App can not be installed on some devices such as Apple TV, Roku, Xbox etc, for those devices, a dongle is necessary)",
      "For people used or heard about VPN in the past, AlwaysHome runs different software stack and protocols that can connect to a residential place, rather than a data center server that VPNs or Smart DNS connect to. AlwaysHome users actually have a residential IP address when they access any websites. On the other hand, data center based VPNs are normally using IP addresses that allocated to businesses which makes them easier to be identified. You can google around \u201cWhy Do Some Websites Block VPNs?\u201c for more background information on why and how VPNs can get blocked by streaming sites.",
      "AlwaysHome runs through a home network",
      "VPN normally runs through a data center server",
      "When accessing streaming services from far away, AlwaysHome is 3-10 times faster than normal VPN and enables you to watch videos in full HD quality. For curious hearts, the technology we implemented is called WAN optimization, which has been widely used by a large company to connect their global offices and branches.",
      "The technology is good for applications other than streaming as well. Through AlwaysHome, you get a faster email, research, collaboration, and pretty much faster everything,",
      "As shown in the following diagram, you can set up a home proxy right within your home, for your own use. When at out of the home, you can connect back through this proxy device to access in-home network devices (such as IP camera, printer, computers, etc) or streaming services, just like accessing them from home, even you are physically far away from home.",
      "You can use a dongle as the home proxy or your own devices like Firestick or Android TV box, as long as you can install AlwaysHome App on it.",
      "Because the home proxy is on your home network, your access to the internet will have your home IP address and to any website, the access is right from your home.",
      "You can find the perk(s) that fit your needs and then buy it. If you need multiple perks, just buy and pay for each one of them. Then we will set up the right configuration for you. If you purchase a dongle, we will preconfigure it as well and then ship it out. You will receive an email notification when things are shipped out. When receiving your order, it should take no more than a few minutes to get everything started, most of the time, it should be just plug&play.  If not, please contact our support@homingsystems and describe in detail the symptom.",
      "AlwaysHome is designed for average people who don't have much technical background. The system is very easy to set up. When you receive your order, the device(s) and account(s) are already preconfigured and tested working. All you need to do is plug and play. We also put up some instructional videos on our support website at www.homingsystems.com/support for your reference. Apps can also be download from links on the support page. As an example, here is a quick video to set up the Solo pack. There are videos for other perks on our support page.",
      "Please note: If you receive the order and can not make it work in 20 minutes, it is likely you have missed some basis, so please contact our support@homingsystems.com to get things sorted out. Please provide as much detail as possible the steps taking and any symptoms you observed (screenshot or short video would be great information for us to quickly troubleshoot).",
      "AlwaysHome is NOT a replacement to your basic Internet service. The AlwaysHome runs on top of the Internet. So you can NOT use AlwaysHome at places that do not have basic Internet services such as home broadband (Fiber, DSL, etc), WiFi or 4G/3G.",
      "AlwaysHome is NOT a replacement to streaming subscriptions such as Netflix membership.",
      "Once you buy our product, a single share on your Facebook profile or Twitter would definitely help this amazing piece of gadget reach another enthusiastic. Please note: in the package, the adapter is US style and optional. You can use your own regular charger if this US style does not fit well in your country.",
      "1) Why you have different shipping dates for perks and they are from the past?",
      "The original campaign started in Sept 2017, products were shipped out since Oct 2017. Now we are in the in-demand status and people can still get special deals here on Indiegogo. We have sold out some perks (some for multiple times) and we have put them back. That's why the shipping dates vary. Because the products are in stock, the shipping dates are always in the past when you look at it.",
      "2) I am an expat, I want to access US Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video, but I don't have family or friends that can host the home proxy for me, can you or your company host it for me?",
      "Because the home proxy has to be in a residence which makes it infeasible for us to host it for multiple users. You need to have a residential place to set up the home proxy in your home country. Nowadays, many people already have devices like Amazon Fire Stick at home, so just ask them to install and run the AlwaysHome App for you. There is also a feature coming up this month that will prevent your access to their internal network devices (only websites through their the home network) so they don't need to worry about security issues this may cause.",
      "3) I am not a technical guy and still a bit confused about the user license, could you explain more?",
      "We don't charge the use of the home proxy. We charge a subscription to each remote App account that is used to connect to the home proxy. We also charge a subscription to each remote dongle that is connected to the home proxy.\n\nFor example, David travels to Asia from time to time. He wants to keep watching US version of Netflix, Hulu and Xfinity show when he travels. He set up a home dongle at his New York home and then installed AlwaysHome Mobile on his Mac computer. In Asia, he opens Mac computer, starts the App and then watches all the shows he wants just like at home. For David, he needs to buy a dongle hardware and then pay for a subscription license for App account to run on his Mac.\n\nAnother example, John lives in Dubai with his family. He set up one home dongle at Florida home and then at Dubai home, he set up a remote dongle for his Apple TV and other devices to connect back to Florida home. His daughter would be able to watch streaming shows just like at Florida home. For this, he pays for the home dongle hardware and the remote dongle hardware and one subscription license for the remote dongle to run. He then purchased another subscription license for his App so he can use it on his iPhone/iPad when he is out of Dubai home.",
      "1) None of the perks meet my needs, I need a customized configuration. So what should I do?",
      "You can claim multiple perks from our campaign. Order dongle and user license separately from different perks and combine them to meet your need. When adding dongle, use the perk that reads like \"add extra dongle (no shipping cost)\" in together with your other perk. This extra dongle perk has to be ordered when you have other otherwise there is no shipping address in the system so we never know it needs to be shipped.",
      "2) Can you ship on time? I want it as a holiday gift for my family, it\u2019s important for it to get it before the holidays.",
      "Yes. The campaign is now in in-demand and we normally ship within 1-2 business days after receiving your order. When you see your order is in \"lock\" state, that means we are processing your order to be shipped out. If you only order subscription license, we will setup things and email you the details so you can start using the service right away.",
      "3) 3-10 times faster internet, multiple device connectivity, space shifting revolution; seems too good to believe! Is this for real?",
      "We have come to the 3rd major release of our product and thousands of users have been using it ever since its advent in 2015 for the first time. Along the way, we solved quite some challenging problems so our stuff is not just an idea that just sprouted out of the box.",
      "Although every user is different with the internet infrastructure he is using, 3-10 times faster is a norm and observed by our customers especially those in Asia, Africa, and Mid East.",
      "We offer the best price with the features untouched yet. That\u2019s why we brought a software update which allows you to use your phone, tablet or streaming box as space shifted streaming device even without the dongle. Yes, it is real. Time to believe.",
      "4) How do you compare your pricing with VPNs?",
      "First of all, no VPN service out there can do what our solution can do. They normally get blocked by streaming service providers (a good search of \"Netflix block VPN\" will reveal the fact). We price the service in the lower end to mid range of all good VPNs. We are able to do so because our software is more efficient and cost less hardware resource to run. Also, our solution can leverage your home network bandwidth that you already have, that will reduce the number of servers we need to set up.",
      "5) I know networking, could you elaborate on how you measured network performance to support your acceleration claim?",
      "Measuring real-time network acceleration is just a piece of cake. We use mainly speedtest.net for this task. You can go to the platform and start to measure the download and upload speed of your network connection and compare it after connecting to the network with AlwaysHome.  And the results will look as just as ours. We have proven results from our customers around the world.",
      "Note: the performance is subjected to ISP policy regarding bandwidth shaping, physical network bandwidth limit etc. Those are physical factors that AlwaysHome may not solve. However, almost all the ISP\u2019s networks, we've tested have rendered the 3-10 network acceleration.",
      "1) If the home proxy is down, can my remote devices fall to a server and access the blocked websites?",
      "Yes. You log in to the web portal with your account and configure your devices or dongle to use our servers deployed in US/UK/Korea/German etc. Or you can email us and let us know the home proxy is down and we will manually switch your App/dongle to connect to our servers within a few hours. Connecting to our server will NOT get Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Instant Video who are aggressively blocking access from public servers, including many VPNs and our servers as well. Connecting to our server will get you to Google, Facebook, YouTube etc which are blocked in some countries.",
      "2) How many users can the dongle support simultaneously?",
      "When using the dongle as the home proxy, we suggest limiting the CONCURRENT remote devices up to 5. When using the dongle as a remote device, technically there is no limit of devices that can be connected to it simultaneously. But we suggest not to surpass the number more than 10.  Please keep in mind that the bandwidth will be shared among all users. If you are using your own devices such as Amazon Fire Stick as the home proxy, we believe it can support more than 100 devices.",
      "3) I have an old phone, can I turn it into a home proxy?",
      "Yes, it needs to be Android 4.4 or above, or iOS 10 or above. You need to make sure the AlwaysHome App keeps running all the time. That means you need to open the App and leave the screen saver off that the phone OS won't kill it even it is idling.",
      "4) Between remote device and home proxy, is the communication going via the Homing cloud or directly between them? If it's the latter, how do communications traverse firewalls without port forwarding being set up?",
      "It is mostly the latter. Remote device and home proxy all connect to Homing Cloud and they will be instructed to start a process called NAT traversal which enables a direct communication without port forwarding. In most of the cases, NAT traversal can work successfully. From then on, user data will be exchanged between these two directly. In some rare cases, NAT traversal does not work and a direct link is not possible. Then a middle server doing the piggyback will be utilized so the communication between the two dongles will go through our mid server.",
      "5) What makes AlwaysHome stand out from the other VPNs in the market?",
      "VPNs are good under certain conditions. But they typically become hard to manage when the user count goes up. VPNs are designed for data encryption. When the user count goes high with its popularity, they become slower & interrupted especially when the user can choose which server to get on. AlwaysHome is a cloud-based distributed server infrastructure that supports fault tolerance and great scalability to handle a large number of concurrent users.",
      "VPNs are using standard protocols like PPTP\uff0cL2TP\uff0cOpenVPN which can be easily identified by \u201cmiddleboxes\u201d such as firewall or proxy or routers with DPI (deep packet inspection) capabilities. Those boxes can easily block VPNs once identified. AlwaysHome, however, employs proprietary protocols that are not known to middleboxes. It means AlwaysHome does not suffer the blockage that VPNs are subject to.",
      "VPNs were designed to be a security solution, never meant to accelerate network performance. AlwaysHome, on the other hand, has a technology called WAN optimization. This technology can significantly accelerate network speed over a long distance on the Internet.",
      "So, if you are a VPN user and still think that it\u2019s one of the precious technologies in the 21st century, you definitely want to check out AlwaysHome.",
      "6) The dongle seems nicely designed. Can I use it at a coffee shop or hotel where there is no cable around and sometimes the captive authentication is needed?",
      "Yes, dongle support to use public Wi-Fi for the Internet to connect itself to and at the same time provide downlink Wi-Fi to attached devices. You can attach a phone/computer to the dongle and then login dongle\u2019s web management interface and configure the dongle to use a surrounding Wi-Fi hotspot. It also supports those Wi-Fi hotspots using so-called \u201ccaptive authentication\u201d that requires one to agree on terms, input a code etc. before using the Wi-Fi.",
      "7) Does AlwaysHome support PPTP/L2TP or OpenVPN?",
      "No. The data protocols are proprietary and developed by the AlwaysHome developers.",
      "8) Technically, the dongle acts as VPN or proxy?",
      "Technically speaking, AlwaysHome is not VPN but rather a TCP proxy service, with network acceleration capability. It is not HTTP proxy though.",
      "9) I am worried that someone can access my home network through the home proxy. How can you guarantee security?",
      "That\u2019s a valid concern and we have addressed it deeply. All devices including home proxy are all behind a firewall and do NOT require you to open a port on your home router for port forward function. So your home proxy and home network are still protected just like your other devices at home. Accessing home proxy can only be done through a valid and configured dongle or App that requires valid user login.",
      "Accessing of in-home devices can be disabled if you want to share your home proxy with friends so that they can access streaming websites, but not your home network devices, like your PC or NAS.",
      "10) How stable is your system? Will there be network interruptions as other VPNs?",
      "Our system is based on a cloud-based distributed server infrastructure which has high fault tolerance and scalability. Unlike VPN, which is normally point to point, in our system, the finding and switching to a working server is done automatically against a pool of servers. So the whole system works more reliably than VPN.",
      "11) If I have an Android TV, can I connect it to the dongle and access content from out of my home country?",
      "Yes, you need to install the App on your TV. So, as long as the Android TV has access to Google Play TV (AlwaysHome App is in Google Play) or you know how to install an APK manually onto your TV, you can watch your home country shows without geo-restrictions.",

      "We ship globally excluding the following which has been flagged by courier services as restricted or high risk: Belarus, Cote d'Ivoire, Cuba, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Liberia, North Korea, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Syria & Zimbabwe.

On occasions post service is used for some hard to reach areas or countries, please expect 2-3 weeks or even longer delivery time.",
      "It is very important to have your correct address and phone number on file. We had a couple of returns which are very high cost because of the incorrect address info.",
      "3) Do I have to pay European VAT / GST?",

Together, with my friends from UCLA and Stanford Business School, we decided enough was enough with these obnoxiously designed, toxic products that cluttered our homes. We hated that natural products were more expensive, and most of the time, didn\u2019t do the job. Collectively, we have 15+ years of business experience covering major functions of sales, marketing, and supply chain, alongside progressive R&D and new product development expertise with Fortune 500 firms and successful startups.",
      "Everywhere, people overpay by the thousands to simply stay away from toxic goods. As more and more formulations become cheaper, big corporations buy up new solutions and tuck them away in order to make profit and still market their same synthetic products.",

Under the popular MPC Impressions playing cards series, which has seen huge success on our previous decks, we bring to you yet another astounding and ground-breaking deck of playing cards which we are calling it the AQUA deck.",
      "The AQUA playing cards really is the closest thing to an invisible deck of cards which you can still physically hold. It is the latest addition to our popular Impressions playing card series by MakePlayingCards.com (MPC), a branded playing cards and card games manufacturer with over 35 years history.",
      "The AQUA deck is made using a very smart arrangement of state of the art printing and production machinery which together, can produce amazing results. We use premium transparent plastic card stock which we then apply high-gloss transparent print with pinpoint accuracy, to certain areas of the playing cards to produce a sleek raised gloss embossed effect. The cards are then completed with a finishing that enables the cards to glide seamlessly for fans and springs and perform as you\u2019d expect a high quality deck of playing cards to perform. Cutting the cards is no problem either as we use our MPC state of the art cutter to ensure the edges are angled for cutting into. The thickness of the deck is pretty much like a standard deck of cards.",
      "The finishing used on this deck is unique. Most plastic playing cannot perform like a normal deck of cards in that they stick together in clumps. Not the Aqua deck as it was designed for performing with so you can make beautiful fans easily.",
      "We designed the deck of cards to be completely transparent so what\u2019s better than a matching transparent plastic tuck box? We tried several different types of tuck boxes as we wanted the packaging to complement these beautiful and very unique playing cards. We decided on using a frosted transparent plastic box material and applied different densities of high gloss printing to it. The result was stunning. There is no other word for it.",
      "The Aqua deck is a very versatile deck of cards which was conceptualized a few years back. Aesthetically, it is absolutely stunning and mesmerizing so it\u2019s first off a collectors deck and it\u2019s going to amaze anyone who sets their eyes on them. It can definitely be played with. Play any card games with the Aqua deck like you would do with any other deck of playing cards albeit with a fun see-through twist to it.",
      "The Aqua deck was designed and specially developed to be used for shuffling, springing, faroing, fanning, cutting etc so they can be used seamlessly for performing with such as magic tricks in close up card magic. Transparent cards are used quite often now to bring a new dimension into card magic. Now with the Aqua deck, you can design more card tricks to wow your friends, family or audience.",
      "Yes, the Aqua deck is made from premium quality transparent plastic card material with flexible high gloss printing so it can be bent without any issues whatsoever.",
      "Yes, since this deck of cards is made from plastic, even the box, you can dump the complete deck into a tank of water, drop it in the toilet, throw a drink at it, throw the entire deck into a swimming pool or a pond, and it will still be fine.",

Just organic lemons, natural syrups, and flavor combos you\u2019ll crave all summer (think lavender lemonade, mint honey tea, and more).",
      "We're raising $2,500 to help us launch our cart this summer. With your help, we\u2019ll cover the basics: permits, supplies, insurance, and the mobile cart itself. We\u2019re doing it all scrappy and small\u2014but with big flavor and big heart.",
      "In 2023, both of us left jobs that weren\u2019t working anymore\u2014one in tech, the other in insurance\u2014and started dreaming about a new way of life. Colin has worked in food service for years and missed the joy of it: working with his hands, feeding people, and the chaos and thrill of a lunch rush. But starting a restaurant? Too risky. A mobile cart? Just right.",
      "We got inspired watching local vendors at events. We saw an opening for something new\u2014healthier, beautiful, community-driven cold drinks\u2014and Chewy\u2019s was born.",
      "(And the name? A tribute to Colin\u2019s childhood basset hound, Chewy\u2014now our brand mascot and the star of a mini comic series we'll be releasing with the cart!)",
      "Chewy\u2019s is about more than lemonade. It\u2019s about self-determination, joy, and creating something real and lasting in our community. We dream of becoming a neighborhood favorite, where you can stop by for a drink and a conversation. We want to share hand-drawn comics featuring Chewy and friends, and bring people together with a vibe that feels peaceful, inclusive, and whimsical.",
      "We also want to have a pay-it-forward system where anyone can pre-purchase a drink for someone in need. Neighbors who could use a free refreshment can come by anytime, no questions asked. It\u2019s community care, one cup at a time.",
      "And we\u2019re not stopping when the weather cools. This fall and winter, Chewy\u2019s will shift to cozy seasonal drinks like cider, cocoa, coffee, and tea\u2014still made with all-natural ingredients and served with the same community-centered energy. We\u2019ll also start offering a small selection of homemade baked goods, so there\u2019s always something warm and delicious waiting for you at the cart.",
      "And one day? We\u2019d love to grow into a brick-and-mortar restaurant serving pizza and kombucha with plenty of vegan options and even more community energy.",
      "We're not taking out loans or chasing investors. This is grassroots, community-backed, and run by two people who are ready to do the work.",
      "We're offering experience-based rewards that let you come along for the ride\u2014from taste tests to the grand opening party to free lemonade for life. Check them out in the sidebar!",
      "Your support isn\u2019t just helping two people build a business\u2014it\u2019s helping build a life that\u2019s sustainable, connected, and joyful. You\u2019re joining our journey from day one. Every backer will get campaign updates, behind-the-scenes peeks, and the chance to shape the future of Chewy\u2019s.",
      "Whether you chip in $5 or $500, you\u2019re a part of this. And we\u2019re so grateful.",

      "We are a team with a shared goal - a mission to create unique products that stand out to challenge the incumbent tech companies, and to make a worldwide difference with top-notch technology.\n\nWe started our journey in wearables by first launching the world's first payments enabled hybrid smartwatch on Kickstarter.\n\nOur payments feature was live in 28 countries including UK, EU and India.During Covid, we understood the need of the hour and developed India\u2019s first comprehensive health tracker, which measured 5 crucial health vitals including Blood oxygen levels.\n\nDeploying it in multiple hospitals, 1000+ patient beds and saving hundreds of lives with timely alerts for oxygen requirements helped us to truly understand the profound impact technology can have on our lives.\n\nThese experiences came with a couple of important learnings. We realised that the readings from the finger were far more reliable than those from the wrist and that a wrist worn device was not comfortable to wear all night and all day.\n\nThis gave us the idea for Ring One. We married findings from the health tracking with the learnings from payments feature of our first hybrid smartwatch and came up with something which we believe is truly path breaking - the Ring One.",
      "Algorithms Accuracy: Over the past two years, we've dedicated ourselves to perfecting our vital algorithms. We've rigorously tested them on over 4000 individuals, ensuring they meet the highest standards of accuracy and reliability.\n\nContactless Payments Integration: Our experience with launching contactless payments in wearables for the second time puts us in a strong position. We've fine-tuned the process to ensure a smooth, global rollout. However in some countries, all banks might not be integrated from Day 1, but we will bring them on board in a phase wise manner.\n\nManufacturing:  We've forged a strong partnership with a seasoned contract manufacturer with decades of experience in electronic product assembly. Their expertise will help ensure the smooth production of our smart ring.\n\n While we launch our campaign with confidence, we remain vigilant. We've taken steps to identify potential challenges and have strategies in place to address them swiftly. Our commitment to transparency means you'll always be informed of our progress and any challenges we face.",

      "- heart rate (pulse oximeter)",
      "- oxygen saturation (pulse oximeter)",
      "- changes in the skin temperature (thermometer)",
      "- movement (accelerometer)",
      "All this information is processed by our core sleep-staging algorithm and then used to build your personal sleep staging, which is shown in Neuroon App. In the morning you can read EXACTLY when you fell asleep, when you had the fastest heart rate and when the slowest.",
      "Thanks to this data, Neuroon Open algorithms can show you a detailed architecture of your sleep, calculate your sleep efficiency and what is the most important for you, advise how to improve your sleep habits by suggesting tools (such as meditation) to get a better night\u2019s sleep.",
      "After sleep you can read all the data in the Neuroon Open App",
      "Every single feature in Neuroon Open works due to the mask\u2019s ability to measure sleep metrics in such a detailed manner. And most importantly for most of the features: sleep analysis takes place in REAL TIME!",

      "Learn how you sleep and boost your energy for the day",
      "When we read about sleep and best practices to have a good night\u2019s sleep, it often looks as though there is an universal solution for everybody. But is that really the case? Should all people wake up in the lightest phase of sleep and go to bed around 11pm?",
      "We want to give you a tool to check your sleep performance, then find your best sleep pattern based on both short and long-term feedback.",
      "So how will this tool work?",
      "A/B testing consists of two parts. First it helps you measure your subjective evaluation of sleep quality after various sleep patterns. Second it will objectively check the condition of your brain.",
      "1. After each sleep you will be given a short test in which you estimate your sleep quality and sleepiness after waking on VAS. This self-evaluation system records changes in the subjective reception of your sleep. This is then combined with metabolic and sleep-staging data in order to provide information about the best sleep pattern to suit you.",
      "2. As a voluntary extra option, you will have the possibility to try two short games which measure your mental capabilities after sleep. The working memory test will check your perception and working memory condition upon waking. The cognition test will check your cognitive capability. During the first ten days, Neuroon Open will gather data from the tests to personalize its analytic software. After this period, you will be informed about your daily results compared to the average, allowing you to choose the best sleep pattern for your top mental condition.",
      "These two methods help you to optimize Neuroon Open\u2019s sleep-adjustment tools according to your needs. These tools include artificial dawn, bedroom conditions, specific sleep stage awakenings and optimal time-schedules for falling asleep and waking up.",

Lucid dreaming is a metacognitive state within a dream, which may enable the dreamer to know that they are dreaming or even give them full intellectual ability and volitional control over the dream.\n\nSounds familiar? According to a meta-analysis of lucid dream prevalence and frequency studies, no less than half of you reading this may have experienced at least one lucid dream in your life! The authors of the meta-analysis have proposed that \u201cthe capacity for lucid dreaming is widespread\u201d!",

      "Cognitive techniques are audio sessions that you use before falling asleep- there are similar to guided audio mindfulness sessions that e.g. HeadSpace app uses (headspace.com).",
      "External stimulation consists of light and vibration stimulation provided you while you are asleep, in REM sleep. You can find a simplified scheme of this stimulation (based on F. Paul, M. Sch\u00e4dlich, D. Erlacher, Journal of Dream Research Volume 7, No. 1, 2014).",

      "Prepare your body and mind for the night",
      "Nowadays there is no space to stop doing things and focus on calming your mind and body, and yet the benefits of meditation are priceless. With Neuroon Open we provide guided mindfulness meditation sessions. For those who are unfamiliar with the term: mindfulness meditation is a basic form of meditation in which one concentrates on his or her inner self.",
      "It begins with breath awareness and builds from there. Whenever you find your mind full of thoughts, you return your awareness back to breathing. Because it provides an opportunity to explore one\u2019s mind without judgement or resentment, it is widely used as an integral part in cognitive therapies (Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy or MBCT for short).",
      "With Neuroon Open you can start meditating whenever you feel you need it: at home, at the office or outdoors. The benefits from meditation are visible even after 2 hours of practice.",
      "Neuroon Open meditation feature consists of the three components:",
      "1. Guided audio meditation sessions. Mindfulness meditation audio sessions will interact with your personal physiology based on brain wave readings and pulse oximetry. For example, when you are calm, you will be guided in a different way than when you are tense and nervous. Guidance will be adjusted to these parameters and will change in the middle of the session if your mood dramatically changes. Neuroon Open is the first device that guides your meditation session based on EEG and pulse oximetry in real time.",
      "2. Recording option. Neuroon Open will record your EEG readings, movement and pulse, along with any variations in heart rate during each meditation session. You can compare different sessions and see your progress and the influence of external factors on your mood. It\u2019s not only the mind that alters the way your body functions; your body changes your way of thinking, too.",
      "3. Biofeedback. The Neuroon App gives you the chance to choose which form of feedback you\u2019d prefer and what you\u2019d like from the mask, for example, vibration when dominant brainwaves are alpha or light stimuli while your pulse is raised and unstable. You can customize your biofeedback depending on your needs. It\u2019s all up to you.",

      "Design your perfect wakeup and get energy for the whole day",
      "You might have noticed that it is much easier to wake up when it\u2019s already after sunrise and sunny outside. When you wake up in very dark room you have many difficulties avoiding sleep inertia and getting out of bed on time.",
      "Neuroon Open simulates the light of a slowly-breaking dawn so that you wake up the natural way. The sleep tracker eliminates morning grogginess by waking you at the optimal moment.",
      "When it\u2019s time to wake up, the mask will gradually fill with light that simulates a natural dawn. If you don\u2019t wake up, Neuroon will add gentle vibrations followed by a final audio alarm from your mobile phone.",
      "Neuroon Open allows you to choose out of which phase of sleep you\u2019d like to wake up. For some people the optimal phase to be woken out of is light sleep. For some it\u2019s REM. Using the Neuroon Open app, you will be able to choose. Additionally, while analyzing the EEGs of sleeping people during the product development stage, we discovered that before waking up there is a great deal of what is called \u201cmicro wakeups\u201d. We added an option under the \u201cautomatic\u201d button an option to be woken up from these micro wakeups.",
      "You can choose:",
      "1. If you want to be woken up by light or not",
      "2. If you want to be woken up using vibration or a ringtone, both or neither",
      "3. If you want to use smart wakeups, meaning you can pick a time when the mask should start to gently wake you up before the final alarm (as well as the sleep phase you would like to start waking up in).",

      "So how does it work?",
      "As has already been noted, Neuroon Open is doing sleep data analysis in real time. All of the recorded signals are forwarded to different algorithms, which can then detect various events. After that those events can be further fed into your home network.",
      "To begin we plan to integrate Neuroon Open with IFTTT. This is a free web-based service that can be used to create chains of simple conditional statements, called \u201capplets\u201d. Each applet consists of a trigger and an action. We would like to program a few triggers for the mask that can then be integrated with other smart home devices compatible with IFTTT.",
      "Triggers that will be implemented for this campaign include:",
      "1. The moment of falling asleep",
      "2. REM and NREM detection",
      "3. Exact wake-up moment, or the moment the mask is removed",

      "- Connect Neuroon Open with your smart hi-fi set and so that the volume is reduced when you fall asleep",
      "- Connect Neuroon Open with smart lightning in the home, making it shine gradually every time you wake during the night and take off the mask to go to the bathroom",
      "- Connect Neuroon Open with your Nest and lower the temperature in your room when you enter the REM phase of sleep",
      "Of course there are a great deal more possibilities for smart home integrations.",
      "It all depends which IoT devices you use at home. It also depends on the number of triggers we program \u2013 but given Neuroon Open is open source, why not to program some useful solutions yourself?",
      "We want you to get the most from our work. That\u2019s why we have decided to make out device open-source and share our algorithms. This is what makes Neuroon Open unique.",
      "Our product is now transparent, available to the experts who can audit the code and provide constructive feedback as to what we can make better.",
      "It is verifiable. Researchers using Neuroon for their experiments can see where the results come from and can track the resulting data to electric circuits in the mask.",
      "It is accessible to DIY and Quantified Self-enthusiasts as it provides SDK and raw data access.",
      "Its functions may be extended or enhanced with custom apps and tools. With open APIs and data formats, it\u2019s ready for integration with existing and upcoming technologies.",
      "In an unlikely worst case scenario, if we as a company decided to withdraw our product it could easily be resurrected by a collective of enthusiastic individuals.",
      "We hope that together we can create a new open standard for exploring and enhancing our minds.",
      "On the start day of the Kickstarter campaign we will release all of our work-in-progress:",

      "It can only happen with mass adoption and thriving and healthy community around Neuroon Open. The most important part of which, next to the early adopting customers, is the community of developers, makers, FLOSS hackers, diy coders, researchers, etc. Shortly, the people creating new layers of tools and research upon our part of the work.",

      "This time we won\u2019t spend much time on development because Neuroon Open is pretty much done. It just requires some final polishing and the factory that is based in Poland will start its work in 100%. The most important thing that we learned through the last 4 years was to listen to all the comments and feedback that we have received - the community gave us always lots of energy, great ideas and topics to think about.",

      "A note from the founders of nCamp:",
      "In 2016 we launched nCamp with the goal of helping you create better experiences \u2013 great meals, in the outdoors, shared with others. We love to listen, evolve and keep getting better, and we did that with the help of our backers! We thank you for supporting the nCamp Food Prep Knife!",
      "For more information about nCamp & the Food Prep Knife, visit: www.ncampgear.com",
      "Sincerely,",
      "Dan & John",
      "When it comes to knives, there are many choices. However, there are only a few folding knives designed for food preparation and even fewer that are truly up to the job. This is why we are developing the nCamp Food Prep Knife!",
      "The nCamp Food Prep Knife is a high-quality knife designed for those who want to take their outdoor experience to another level. While we considered the needs of those who might venture into the back country, we also thought about everyday use; barbecue in the backyard or park, picnics and even daily use in the kitchen (at home or the cabin).",
      "We have developed multiple versions and tiers of knives, all of which are premium products designed for the outdoors. We extensively prototyped, tested and refined each one. We listened to backpackers, chefs and grill masters and used their input to create products that we are very proud of.",
      "Dan talking with Chef Ben Bebenroth and getting feedback on ergonomic testing tools designed to help us get the design right.",
      "Each knife has an identical handle shape, making it easy to switch back and forth between knife styles without having to get \u2018reacquainted.\u2019 The handle design was informed by extensive ergonomic testing with the goal of a comfortable secure grip that allows for a variety of gripping styles. It is scalloped at the balance point, allowing for a gradual transition between the handle and blade. All of the fasteners are flush-mounted, so there aren\u2019t any annoying bumps. We have also minimized holes, which tend to collect crud. The top of the handle is closed, which is not always the case with folding knives. This makes it comfortable to hold and very rigid.",
      "We also thought about the parts you can\u2019t see! Beneath the wooden grip the knife frame has cutouts which form a truss-like structure. This reduces the weight and maintains strength, while maintaining good balance between the blade and handle. The frame incorporates a liner-lock which makes the blade very secure when opened.",
      "There are two blade styles: the Chef and the Santoku. Each version includes our signature cut-outs. The cutouts reduce material (and weight) at the widest part of the blade without impacting performance or comfort when applying pressure to the spine. They also provide a bit of an edge, allowing you to flick the blade open with your thumb.",
      "The Chef version (below) is a classic western utility knife. It is useful for all kinds of cutting and slicing. It\u2019s versatility and familiarity made it a no-brainer to include in our lineup.",
      "Specs:",
      "The Santoku version (below) is based on a classic Japanese utility knife. The scalloped blade helps food slices fall off after cutting and the broad surface is ideal for scooping up and moving ingredients.",
      "Specs:",
      "One final feature of the overall design \u2013 we paid close attention to the curve of the blade and its relationship to the heel, balance point and handle. Our final design gives you full use of the blade edge and enough clearance to keep your knuckles from banging into the cutting surface. Something that sounds obvious\u2026but isn\u2019t always considered!",
      "Our Premium Knives (below) have a light-colored beech wood handle which is durable and simple. These knives use 9Cr18MoV steel, which balances corrosion resistance, toughness and edge retention. These come with a Chef or Santoku blade.",
      "Our Elite Knives (below) have a dark-colored walnut handle which is both tough and beautiful. These knives have Damascus blades (wavy pattern made by layering 10Cr18MoV steel). These blades balance beauty, corrosion resistance and toughness, while maintaining a very sharp edge. These come with a Chef or Santoku blade.",
      "The nCamp Food Prep Knife is designed for your pack, but is also great for a picnic basket or even in the kitchen!",
      "The Elite version with a Damascus blade.",
      "We plan to produce four Food Prep Knives: the Premium Chef, the Premium Santoku, the Elite Chef and the Elite Santoku. In addition, we hope to include a series of accessories described in our rewards. If successful, the funds raised will help pay for tooling, inventory and marketing.",
      "Through this project we connected with Chef Ben Bebenroth of Spice Hospitality Group. Ben is an amazing farm-to-table chef and an avid outdoorsman. He has advised, put the products through the paces and served-up great food (fresh caught trout, chantrels from the forest...) in the process. We are grateful for his support on this projet!",
      "Our goal is to bring new, high-quality knives to the market and our rewards include various individual knives and sets. Because we already make other gear designed for an elevated outdoor experience, we have included some of these as part of our rewards.",
      "We have already successfully brought a number of products to market and are excited to introduce yet another through this community of supporters. Throughout the campaign, we'll show you our process, listen to your feedback and (hopefully) hear your encouragement! We would also love to hear your thoughts on other things we should make...especially other version to add to the knife lineup!",

Since our campaign was successful, we approved production tooling in mid-October 2021 and plan to start production early. The precise timing of things like material supply and shipping are beyond our control, so we can\u2019t guarantee delivery before the end of the year\u2026but we sure are going to try!",
      "We started nCamp five years ago. Ever since we have used our resources well, adding new products each year. Our goal with this campaign is to raise $15,000 for the Food Prep Knife Project. We believe this product reinforces our brand promise and will help take us to the next level. The three main uses for the funds raised will be to pay for the tooling & build our initial inventory, to market the product & raise awareness of the brand, and to cover administrative cost.",
      "Because we have several products in production, we are very familiar with this part of the process - we have both US and International partners who will work with us on this. We plan to ship using UPS ground services for the Continental US locations (48 states) and plan to charge $9.00 Flat Shipping Fee for all Rewards $150 and below.  For rewards above $150, we will charge a Flat Shipping Fee of $15.00. Rates may vary for Backers in Alaska and Hawaii. Other shipping rates vary by country and we haven't listed your country, send us a message and we'll research the rates.",
      "nCamp (www.ncampgear.com) started with a question \u2013 could we reduce the bulk of a wood burning camping stove while creating a better cooking experience? This question set the nCamp team on a path to design, manufacture and market outdoor gear. The company was founded by Dan Cuffaro, an industrial designer and college professor, and John Cunningham, a product development executive, a duo with a passion for innovation and the outdoors.",
      "Dan & John at the Outdoor Retailer Show...the early days of nCamp!",
      "Our products are informed by years of cooking outside and a desire to avoid meals in a pouch\u2026in favor of real food. Our products strive for three key characteristics:",
      "Ever since we asked the original question, we have applied the same principles to each new product \u2013 making cool gear that reduces bulk and elevates your outdoor experience. We are also committed to keep doing it!",
      "One unique twist to the Food Prep Knife project is that Dan started as a real time product development example for his students. The process started in early 2021 with identifying the opportunity for a better outdoor food prep knife, conducting research, generating concepts and refining. We hope that the example will end with successfully bringing a product to market!",

      "To get to this point it takes a lot of people and we'd like recognize a few. Thank you to our families, to Jeff at Papertape Media, to Kevin at Click Studio, Ben at Spice Hospitality Group, to the Students, Faculty and Staff at the Cleveland Institute of Art and to so many who helped along the way. Thank you!",
      "Risks and challenges",
      "The nCamp Team is committed to bringing the Food Prep Knives to production in 2021. Our factory has made pre-production prototypes and is ready for the go-ahead to proceed. While we are experienced and have a track record of bringing products to market, the knives are made internationally. This can present challenges with raw materials and shipping. Some of the things we cannot control might impact our delivery timeline.",
      "Long-lasting design",
      "We have chosen very high-quality materials and minimize corrosion and retain the blade edge. Additionally, our design is very simple, so there isn't much to break or go wrong. Finally, we have chosen a manufacturing partner with a history of making durable products. These things add up to a product you can use for a lifetime and pass on to the next generation!",

      "An innovative tool to manage stress and tension",
      "For many, the current options just don\u2019t work. Meet Releevum: a self-serve device designed to manage stress and tension\u2014in a simple, natural, and non-invasive way.",
      "Releevum works by applying pressure to the trigger points at the base of the skull, often reducing stress and releasing tension.",
      "Hi, I\u2019m David Fleming and I\u2019m committed to providing relief to millions with stress and tension-induced health issues.",
      "You see, for years I suffered from chronic headaches that forced me to miss the last 55 days of 5th grade and be homeschooled for the entirety of middle school because I couldn\u2019t meet the attendance requirements. There was no end in sight and I had no idea how my future would look, but I refused to live in pain.",
      "Finding no relief in the traditional solutions, I chose to embrace my obstacles and invented Releevum to liberate myself from the shackles of pain. After experiencing a remarkable transformation in my health and life due to my device, I had perfect attendance throughout high school, enrolled at Yale University, and founded Releevum to enable others to benefit from its life-changing effects. I believe no one should have to live like I did and feel it\u2019s my duty to bring this product to the world.",
      "I\u2019m here to help YOU.",
      "We\u2019ve been conducting research and development for years. Now that we\u2019ve finalized the prototype, we\u2019re confident and ready to transition into mass-production.",
      "We\u2019ve lined up a reliable manufacturing and fulfillment partner, so we don\u2019t anticipate significant supply chain issues. Regardless, we\u2019re committed to keeping our backers updated on the development of the project, in all its stages. Please know that we deeply appreciate your support and will do our best to conquer all of the obstacles that arise.",
      "It\u2019s important to state that Releevum is not intended to prevent, diagnose, or treat any medical condition or disease. Please consult your doctor before using Releevum. If you experience any pain, dizziness, or discomfort while using Releevum, please stop and speak with a doctor. Using any massage tool involves the risk of injury, so please keep that in mind. Remember, Releevum is designed for people who have healthy spines and no condition that would prevent them from safely applying pressure to the suboccipital muscles.",

      "Hey, we\u2019re Ohsnap! We\u2019re a North Carolina-based mobile accessory brand driven to find better ways to use your phone. We\u2019re known for creating ultra-functional, ultra-thin phone grips with a focus on premium materials and usability.",
      "We already have 6 previous successful crowdfunding campaigns (3 on Kickstarter, 3 on Indiegogo), each of which has been fulfilled on schedule. With a focus on clear communication and quick resolution of any issues, we\u2019ve reached a total of over 80,000 backers on crowdfunding sites, and over 1M customers on our own store.",
      "3D-Printed prototype. Colors & finish not final.",
      "Stop using bulky controllers with finicky connections! MCON is the only controller that magnetically slaps to the back of your phone and fits in your pocket! It connects to your phone via bluetooth for easy connection and low-latency gaming.",
      "Launch spring will be hidden on production version",
      "Press down on both buttons at the same time to activate MCON\u2019s auto sliding mechanism that magically reveals the controller from behind your phone and simultaneously slides your screen into the optimal angled position for gaming.",
      "MCON has friction fold out style grips that lock into place for the best ergonomics and comfort for serious gameplay.",
      "Adapter will look more refined in final version.",
      "We designed the MCON to adapt seamlessly to the wide variety of phone shapes, sizes, and camera bump heights, all while keeping it as slim as possible. To achieve this, each MCON comes with two \u201cpucks\u201d, which are thin, 2.5mm discs with embedded MagSafe magnet arrays. Here\u2019s how it works:",
      "1. Adapting to Your Phone:\n\u2022 The pucks attach to the steel plate on the MCON, which is what your phone mounts to.\n\u2022 If your phone has a larger camera bump, like a caseless iPhone 16 (camera bump ~4.5mm), you\u2019ll stack two pucks to ensure proper clearance.\n\u2022 For phones with smaller camera bumps, like an iPhone 12 (~2mm), one puck is usually enough.\n\u2022 If you\u2019re using a case, the case itself often acts as a spacer, so you might only need one puck or none at all.",
      "2. For Phones & Cases Without MagSafe:\nWe\u2019ve included a MagSafe adapter in the box. This is a 2mm-thick disc with adhesive on one side. If your phone or case doesn\u2019t have MagSafe (e.g., most Android phones), simply stick the adapter onto your phone or case. The adapter enables your phone to work seamlessly with the MCON system. By stacking the pucks as needed, you can customize the MCON to fit your phone perfectly, no matter the camera bump or case situation.",
      "Many manufacturers also make MagSafe cases for non-MagSafe phones if you want to avoid adhering a disc to your phone.",
      "Our goal is to natively support iOS, Android, Xbox and PC/Mac. PlayStation is it's own thing and is a bit unknown at this point.",
      "MCON is designed to adapt to any smartphone. The only outliers are vertical flip phones (like Z-Flip or Razr), but based on feedback, we are working on designing different plates as an option that justifies the MagSafe puck further to the side. We will provide more updates on that as we develop it.",
      "* MCON will not work on your grandma's flip phone or any phone without bluetooth.",
      "Full size Hall-effect joysticks are an absolute must for controlled precision AND durability. These sticks are also MUCH less prone to stick drift, common on controllers like the Switch.",
      "MCONs silent buttons produce super quiet and fluid gameplay without disturbing your environment. We'll consider this campaign a success if MCON is banned from classrooms <3",
      "Light mode or dark mode. It's your choice.",
      "Since we reached our stretch goal on Kickstarter, Frosted Clear is available as a CROWDFUNDING EXCLUSIVE color! Kickstarter and IndieGoGo will be the only places you will ever be able to get this color.",
      "Measuring just 5.67 inches long, 2.67 inches wide, and under three-quarters of an inch thick, the MCON is compact enough to fit into any pocket, purse, or backpack. It charges via USB-C in 30 minutes and delivers weeks of gaming on a single charge.",
      "We're nerds, you're a nerd. Let's customize, modify, and repair the things we buy so that we can spend less and generate less waste. MCON can be taken apart with a simple TORX screwdriver so you can do whatever you want.",
      "Mockup packaging",
      "Below is our estimate for standard shipping charges. Because this estimate is based on our expected volume for this campaign, it could be subject to change depending on the final result. These charges may also change if you add additional products during the survey process. We want to keep this process as simple and accurate as possible, while avoiding any false promise or unexpected charges.",
      "Taxes, Customs, and Duties:\nWe want to make sure the entire process is clear and straightforward. Here's what to expect:",
      "Unfortunately we are only able to support certain countries right now, as shipping and warrantying products in some countries is extremely difficult. If you do not see your country on the list, the product will likely not be available. Check back in just in case!",
      "Simply multiply the price you paid by the number of controllers you would like! For example: The super early bird tier is $99, if I wanted to purchase 3, I would pledge $297 for that tier. You can only purchase more at the price tier you backed at. You will be able to pick the color for each controller individually after the campaign is over!",

      "And the best part is\u2026\n\nits detachable and compatible with 99% of all other telescopes with its 1.25\" interface so you can order only a DS1 if you have a telescope and capture the stunning universe.",
      "Get the app to observe through 2 screens with your friend and capture the beautiful universe with ease.",
      "The TW2 Finder has an aperture of 82mm giving it the ability to absorb a great amount of light allowing you to see planets, stars, and the moon in great brightness. The aperture alongside the focal length also gives you 29x zoom capabilities, bringing the reaches of outer space to you. Get crystal clear images of every bit of light that emanates from the universe and see it all in high resolution.",
      "With the Finder TW2 there is no need to get up close and personal with your telescope to take a picture. The remote control lets you snap shots and record videos as you sit comfortably in your chair late at night. \n\nEliminate the possibility of shaking hands disturbing the image you worked so hard to get.",
      "Unlike other telescopes the Beaverlab TW2 is both highly capable and easy to transport. The whole telescope weighs less than 4 kilograms (8 pounds) and is made to be portable. With the TW2 you get a high resolution telescope, 5 inch touchscreen that is designed to be portable. \n\nAttach the legs for the tripod and you now have a new set of eyes that can see into deep space everywhere you go.",
      "Use FInder TW2 as a telephoto camera and see more than the night sky because with Beaverlab, all of nature is for you to witness. Take magnificent photos of animals such as birds, mammals and reptiles, in their natural habitats of mountains, forests and deserts. When you go back to civilization, witness the cityscape through the lens of your TW2 and capture the cityscape.",

      "\u201cUse of a laptop computer is associated with constrained poor postures that may contribute to discomfort in the neck, shoulder and arm. Use of an external mouse, compared to the built-in trackpad on a laptop, allows greater flexibility of arm postures with reduced work of some arm muscles. In side-by-side tests, an external mouse is more productive (speed combined with accuracy) than a trackpad. An external mouse should be one of the first steps to improving employee\u2019s daily comfort and performance while using a laptop, whether at home or in the office.\u201d",

Our productivity suffered greatly without mouses, and touchpads weren\u2019t a perfect substitute, either. That\u2019s when we came up with the idea of attaching a mouse to a tablet, similar to the Apple Pencil. We researched a proper design and structure for a magnetic detachable mouse, and found that a pebble-like design had the best grip.",
      "We then optimized Magnito\u2019s structural design for maximum adhesion, all while sporting a neat appearance. Magnito is built with a Neodymium magnet \u2013 the strongest type of magnet there is \u2013 so it can hold the mouse\u2019s weight with optimal magnetic force.",
      "We added the remote control feature in the prototype test stage. In order to preserve the mouse\u2019s aesthetics, usability, and grip, we developed a switch mode to let you use Magnito as a remote, without having to add any extra buttons.

      "Declutter your mind and reach your goals",
      "Your tool for creating achievable goals.",
      "The Daily Goal Setter by M\u00e5l Paper is a productivity and gratitude planner, specifically designed to help you to achieve your goals.",
      "The Daily Goal Setter planner is M\u00e5l Paper\u2019s first product to be launched. Simple and effective, the Daily Goal Setter enables you to create a clutter-free canvas for optimising your potential.",
      "The Daily Goal Setter is more than just a planner. It explains how to effectively set goals so you can identify and prioritise your long-term, medium-term and short-term goals, while creating actionable tasks to help you achieve tasks.",
      "M\u00e5l Paper was created due to a lack of stationery available specifically designed as a tool to help de-clutter your mind.",
      "The word \u2018M\u00e5l\u2019 means \u2018goal\u2019 in Swedish. Our stationery range also takes inspiration from the Scandinavian clean and clutter-free way of living.  As a result, M\u00e5l Paper was born - the stylish and simplistic stationery brand that helps us to be more productive by focusing our minds on the most important tasks.",
      "The Daily Goal Setter planner is the result of seeking a product to solve the common problem of jumping from one task to the next, without prioritising them or even completing the previous task. We were tired of having countless \u2018to-do\u2019 lists on notepads, notebooks and journals that did nothing more than complicate our goals and tasks further, to the point of feeling overwhelmed and uninspired to hold ourselves accountable.",
      "That\u2019s exactly why we designed a planner that will help you to confirm and structure your goals, keeping you organised and focused.",
      "Our mission with the Daily Goal Setter planner is simple. Focus on creating a product that gives the user clarity on what they want to achieve, while helping them plan out the tasks that will help them to get there with the use of positive mind shift setting, measurement and effectiveness. We also wanted the planner to help create a positive mindset with the use of daily gratitude practices and affirmations.",
      "To help us create this planner we looked towards the methods used by outstanding performers and how they set themselves for a productive day, week or month. In the Daily Goal Setter planner, you will see elements from some of the principles and methods they use, most notably the methods from Brian Tracy\u2019s Eat That Frog. A simple method used to help rid you of procrastination and help you in achieving more goals in less time.",
      "While there are a number of productivity and gratitude based planners and journals on the market, we believe that we have de-cluttered some of the fussier designs and added more practicality.",
      "We want you to have the most productive, gratifying and fulfilling life possible. With the Daily Goal Setter planner, you\u2019ve taken the first step.",
      "Be clear on what it is you want to achieve in your short, medium and long-term goals. Stay focussed by referring back to your goals and the tasks that will help achieve these.",
      "Plan your day, week and months tasks by prioritising them in order of importance. Prioritising and planning your tasks will mean you have a proactive day, rather than a reactive day. Focus on the tasks you\u2019ve prioritised, rather than the less important, quick win tasks.",
      "Start and end your day on a high, by reflecting on everything that you are grateful for. Using the daily practice of gratitude and affirmations will help create a positive mindset that will be carried on to all aspects of your life.",
      "Celebrate your wins, and work out what you can do to improve on tasks that didn\u2019t go to plan. At the end of each day, week and month you\u2019ll reflect on how effective and productive you were, and how much closer you are to achieving your goals.",
      "By backing our project, you will be one of the first in the world to receive a M\u00e5l Paper Daily Goal Setter planner. This will help us put the planners into production, and in exchange, you will receive either the pdf version or physical hard copy of the planner at a discounted price.",
      "At M\u00e5l Paper we believe in giving back and helping our community where we can. We thought of no better way to do this by supporting YoungMinds, the UK's leading charity committed to improving the mental health of children and young people.",
      "For every pledge, through Indiegogo of a Daily Goal Setter planner, we will donate \u00a31 to YoungMinds charity. Following on from the Indiegogo campaign, we will donate \u00a31 from every sale made from malpaper.com",

    "allParagraphs": [
      "Massager, infrared therapy and built-in speakers only you can hear help you relax and sleep better.",
      "Jself combines the best relaxing technology with an all-natural latex pillow designed to make you sleep like a baby. The built-in infrared warmth and pulsating massager relax your sore neck after work, before falling asleep with soft music playing through the built-in speaker. Best of all, when you fall asleep, the pillow will automatically switch off all the electronics in 30 minutes, turning Jself into the pillow of your dreams, literally.",
      "Reviewed by Chigz Tech",
      "Many of us wake up with a sore neck and back, and by using our computer all day, we'll make sure we're coming home feeling even worse.",
      "Jself helps relieve this by providing three solutions in one great pillow. The massager and infrared therapy help you relax tense muscles in your neck when you come home from work.",
      "When it\u2019s time to sleep, the contoured, soft but supporting natural latex will help you fall asleep fast and wake up refreshed without neck or back pain.",
      "Throughout our lifetime, we spend an enormous 26 years asleep. Surprisingly, we also spend 7 years trying to get to sleep. That's 33 years or 12,045 days spent in bed.",
      "So a premium pillow is not really a luxury as it plays an important role in your sleep. Why don't you get a fantastic pillow which can help relieve your sore muscles after work? And how much are you willing to pay for a sound sleep?",
      "We\u2019ve integrated an infrared therapy and massaging unit into the pillow, delivering soothing warmth and relaxing vibrations after a long day at work. They can be used together or individually, and different modes give you a customized experience for optimal relaxation.",
      "The pillow is designed to release tension in your neck, relaxing and recharging you, whether you\u2019re resting, or recharging for a night-shift.",
      "Don\u2019t worry about falling asleep with the infrared or massager still turned on, Jself will stop working in 30 minutes when you fall asleep and turns off all the electronics.",
      "Take a deep breath and relax with the built-in pulsating massager. Just close your eyes and imagine the gentle touch of a masseur rubbing your neck. If rough is what you're into, that's fine, we won't judge, our pillow comes with three different modes.",
      "Jself has built-in speakers, that\u2019s fancy talk for a new type of speaker that only you can hear, not the people next to you. The pillow comes with its own set of snooze-inducing tunes, but you can also connect your phone to play your favorite white noise and music.",
      "Listen to our beautiful built-in music, or wirelessly connect your phone. You can even stream the audio of your favorite shows through the pillow if you're watching Netflix in bed and don't want to disturb the person next to you.",
      "The Jself pillow is entirely made out of natural latex, responsibly derived from trees. Not only does it offer great support for your back and neck, it is naturally hypoallergenic. It's how mother nature wants you to sleep.",
      "So what makes the Jself pillow so great at its job of relaxing you? Every feature we've added to the pillow has been researched extensively. From the right temperature of the infrared heat to the most relaxing frequency of the massager. Below you'll find a bit more about the science behind the Jself pillow.",
      "We've tried different pillow fabrics before ultimately settling on graphene. This luxury material which is very soft to the touch and conducts heat extremely well, which helps with the infrared heating option. Different people, different preferences so we designed three different heating modes to choose from. It's luxury meeting science at its finest.",
      "Whether you\u2019re a side- or back sleeper, Jself gives great support to your back and neck with its ergonomic design. Jself is not just some massage gadget, your chiropractor would be proud of you for sleeping on it because it offers great support throughout the night. The latex core has air holes to keep you cool, so you won\u2019t wake up in a sweat.",
      "The air holes are designed to make Jself even more breathable and dry, sleep better at a pleasant temperature.",
      "Teamwork makes the dream work, literally. \nThe incredible sleep scientists at our R&D center have had many sleepless nights to ensure you can, well, sleep! Our company Shuixing Textile is the biggest pillow and duvet company in China, or as we like to call it, the dream factory.\nOur team is in charge of developing the technology that goes into Jself, as well as extensively testing the pillow for comfort, safety, and durability.",
      "Why crowdfunding?\nYou might think, \u2018why do some of China\u2019s best and brightest companies need my support on Indiegogo?\u2019 Well, to be honest, we\u2019re ambitious, and we want to share the best of China with the whole world, but launching overseas isn\u2019t always easy. We know how to manufacture and ship a product like no other, but there\u2019s more to building a brand, and developing a community of happy customers like you.\nWe really appreciate your support, and thrive on your feedback to make our products even better. Crowdfunding allows us to talk with you directly, rather than going through distributors and stores. And that\u2019s why we want to hear from you! What do you like? What can we do better? Please tell us, we can\u2019t wait to hear what you think.",
      "As the coronavirus spreads across China, medical masks, protective suits are urgently needed at present in China.",
      "Shuixing is using their assembly lines to pump out more protective suits and other medical supplies to help support the front-line medical workers. We are now producing 2,000 protective suits a day for the medical workers, believe that we can finally win the war with all the efforts of the society.",
      "We won't rest until you do, so please, help us help you by supporting our campaign. Together we can make the world a more well-rested and relaxed place, one Jself at a time.",
      "Thank you, and please reach out to us with any questions you might have, we're very well rested and here to help.",

      "That brings us here, where with the Indiegogo community's help, we are taking that amazing comfortable fit design, great audio quality and tuning, and turning it into a next-generation True Wireless earbud design that solves some of the most pressing UX issues of earbuds today.",

      "We wanted something that solves all the UX issues with earbuds today, shows all the valuable info on a display, and at the same time looks & feels amazing as a product.",

      "When we started looking at the true-wireless earbuds market a year ago, it was apparent that over the last few years, innovation in TWS earbuds has stagnated - almost every earbuds look the same, work the same way, and are from the same set of OEM factories simply rebadged with some minor tweaks in aesthetics or specs.",
      "To us, this signaled the market space is ripe for disruption. So we went back to first-principles to look at what really mattered from the user experience, to create something that really is a step jump from everything else out there.",
      "This vision has brought us angel investment, which we're grateful has allowed us to build what we have today - the team, brand, initial products, and also enabled us to put in place all our product dev and manufacturing supply chain, commerce, and fulfilment infrastructure. So we have in place now, a modern backend and support infrastructure that can efficiently build new products from concept all the way to market roll out, and happy customers worldwide who love what we've delivered.",
      "We chose crowdfunding as our next step because we want to engage with a community that loves disruptive products that are out to change the world, with whom we can engage to collaboratively craft the product and features, while also allowing us to finance hardware related expenses such as injection mold tooling, certification, and minimum order inventories associated with scaling up.",
      "The crowdfunding route allows us to realize such products as this, without needing to raise a VC financing round, which would have made us beholden to growth targets, revenue numbers, or product timelines imposed by investors who may not necessarily have the same level of passion as the team in crafting products that make a difference to you.",
      "Thank you for your support, and this will be the first of many disruptive products to come your way.",
      "- Team Morph",
      "We expect to start deliveries 7 months from when the Indiegogo InDemand campaign began.",
      "As our goal is to collaboratively create an awesome product with the crowdfunding community, we may propose additional features as we go along, e.g. as stretch goals, or options, and gather your feedback via survey responses if we should incorporate these into the product. Should any of these new features require additional development time to delivery, we'll be upfront in stating that very clearly in any survey sent out, so your responses can consider that.",
      "We've also been doing hardware for a while, and have been delivering existing products to market already. So while unanticipated events may happen again in global supply chains such as during the Covid-19 pandemic, we have already got all our existing suppliers in place to make sure things move along with minimal impact.",
      "We'll collect shipping and taxes separately after the campaign is over, and just before we ship the product out to you.",
      "Reason for this is, during the current Covid-19 pandemic, shipping costs have gone up significantly. However, we do believe that the prices will go down as the situation improves over the year. Thus we don't feel it fair to charge you the high shipping costs that exist today, which may be alot more expensive than it is in a few months time.",
      "We'll charge the current prices accordingly, right before we ship the product out to you. This is estimated to be between USD5 to USD25, depending on destination, and depending on the global shipping logistics situation as the world eases out of the pandemic.",
      "Prices do not include taxes and VAT. That will be subject to the laws and regulations of each individual country, and charged separately.",
      "The Morph team have been producing and assembling our existing earphones products for more than a year, shipping products to users worldwide since March 2020.",
      "Our customers have consistently given us 5-star ratings in product quality and customer service. Thus unlike many other crowdfunding campaigns, we are a team who already are shipping products, and we have gotten pretty good at creating and delivering hardware. Even before Morph, the team have been working in the audio consumer electronics industry for over a decade, with some of us from Creative Labs (well known for the SoundBlaster card and MP3 players in the 90's and 2000's) as well as other tech companies. Thus we have a very established background in this space, and also have been working with a set of highly qualified and reputable manufacturing partners.",
      "For this next product, the Morph InfiniConnect, we feel the risks of us not delivering a working product is minimal. We are extremely confident and dedicated in ensuring everyone who backs us in this crowdfunding campaign receives their product.",
      "However, as we've seen with the Covid-19 pandemic, totally unexpected things may happen along the way. If any such delays were to occur, we will be very upfront and consistently update all our backers with full transparency.",
      "The Morph InfiniConnect already has reached a stage of a working prototype, so we know the functionality is proven for something as novel as this product. But we're doing this crowdfunding campaign because we want to engage the community in crafting the final product before we ship it out - we will refine the prototype through several iterations and user reviews, before we head to mass production. This will ensure that the final product provides a top-notch user experience. We believe in making the best product possible for our users, and this crowdfunding campaign enables that.",

      "We want to help young people release academic and/or work stress.",
      "Hello! My name is Francisco G\u00f3mez, and my partner is Edgar Arellano. Together, we have the initiative to start our first business at the age of 20. Our idea is to open a bar. And you might wonder, \"What sets your bar apart from the others?\" Well, in my hometown, Tlaltenango de S\u00e1nchez Rom\u00e1n, Zacatecas, Mexico, unfortunately, all the bars are tainted by the bad influence of drugs. In our bar, we want to give young people like us the initiative to show that it's possible to have fun without consuming illicit substances. We even want to include 100% of people who don't drink alcohol by offering non-alcoholic beverages and 0% beer.",
      "However, like everything, investment is a problem. Of course, we're young workers, and together we're saving money through our jobs, and we're also students! We're in our 5th semester of university, studying Business Administration. We want to graduate with our own business. Unfortunately, the permit to sell these products is too expensive. In the area where we live, wages are low. In a place where you work 9-10 hours a day, with one day of rest, you're paid only 800 Mexican pesos, approximately $40 per week.",
      "That's why we're daring to ask for help from everyone to achieve this goal, a dream we share. Many successes have come from this method, and we hope to be one of them. Thank you in advance for your attention and for taking the time to read this. If you have any questions or need clarification, I'm available and open to suggestions.",

      "Dynamic Customization is unlike memory foam, foot molds, heating customization, feet scanning machines or other static devices.",
      "It shapes to your feet and does not bounce back to its original shape or just remain static. Rather it continuously shapes perfectly to the contour of the user's feet.",
      "Several years ago I went to a podiatrist to get a pair of orthotic insoles. He took a mold of my feet, sent them to a lab and $700 later I got the most uncomfortable pieces of plastic that I could hardly keep in my shoes.",
      "In truth, although I was frustrated by my new purchase, it was a great day in my life because it got me started on the research that led me to the creation of \"Dynamic Customization\". I asked myself why the insoles had to be hard, why must one sacrifice comfort for the sake of support. I asked many questions of podiatrists, biomechanic engineers, shoe designers and many people who wore shoe inserts.",
      "It was clear that other than the small percentage of people who need their insoles to compensate for more complex issues, hundreds of millions of people just need some extra arch support and additional comfort.",

We are eager to imagine and innovate boldly in every aspect, taking into account real needs. Our product has undergone multiple tests and optimizations to guarantee that it can effectively complete the task at hand.",
      "Our objective is to produce a special EDC tool that provides greater convenience and enjoyment than ever before.",
      "Titanium multifunctional magnetic screwdriver integrated tool----TI-MMS",
      "It works with any standard 1/4 bits. You can easily replace the screwdriver heads to suit your needs.",
      "Material of screwdriver bit for TI-MMS configuration: Steel",
      "The slanted socket design of the screwdriver makes it easy to take and place the screwdriver head. To remove the screwdriver head from the magnet, gently grip it with two fingers and then straighten your fingers to easily separate it. This design provides greater convenience and can significantly improve work efficiency compared to a vertical design.",
      "TI-MMS is designed with portability and safety in mind. We have placed powerful magnets at the bottom of each storage position, which can firmly attach to the screwdriver head, ensuring that they are not easily detached or lost. In any case, if the product experiences normal shaking during use, the screwdriver heads will stay firmly in place. This means you can safely put it into your backpack, pocket, or toolbox without worrying about the screwdriver head getting lost or scattered. No matter where you are, you can always take out the required screwdriver head for use, greatly improving the flexibility and convenience of work and life.",
      "On the side of this TI-MMS product, we configured hexagonal holes for inserting the screwdriver head.",
      "The magnetic feature is cleverly embedded inside the drill hole. This innovative design not only allows the drill to quickly and securely attach to the hole, but also significantly improves efficiency and stability during operation. The precision CNC machining technology creates a drill hole that perfectly matches standard 1/4 drill bits, ensuring excellent performance with almost zero wear during use.",
      "Our products feature a unique ratchet mechanism that allows for continuous output and easy torque direction changes by flipping it to the other side.",
      "When evaluating the use of hollow ratchet mechanisms, we discovered that this design often necessitates users to block the bottom of the screwdriver head with their fingers to ensure stable operation. This not only significantly reduces work efficiency but may also cause discomfort to the user's fingers.",
      "To address this issue, we have implemented a semi-open design. The main body of the TI-MMS product can fully support the force the screwdriver head needs during operation, eliminating the need for additional support from your fingers. This design enhances work efficiency and offers a more comfortable experience. We are confident that this TI-MMS product can handle various tasks effectively.",
      "We have also installed three magnets under the ratchet mechanism. Two of these magnets use magnetic force to secure the ratchet mechanism, ensuring product stability and portability. The third magnet, located in the middle, is used to secure the screwdriver head during operation, preventing it from falling or getting lost.",
      "It's important to note that the ratchet mechanism's unique design makes it conveniently installed on the side. The card slot fits precisely and is supported by a strong magnet, ensuring excellent stability and firmness, and providing a reliable guarantee for your use.",
      "During the operation of both plug-in and ratchet mechanisms, we have elaborately designed an anti-skid groove to ensure it can effectively tighten or remove screws when extra force is needed. The non-slip grooves improve work efficiency and ensure operational safety.",
      "Furthermore, we have thoughtfully integrated anti-slip lines as decorative elements on the main body of the TI-MMS. These specially designed lines not only improve the tool's appearance, but also provide a unique tactile experience, ensuring a more comfortable and pleasant user interaction. From a visual, tactile, and user experience standpoint, these anti-slip lines add a distinctive charm to the tool.",
      "We have incorporated two highly useful features into the overall design, which are relevant in everyday life. Multi-function Pry Bar&Micro Folding Scalpel Knife.",
      "We have designed a multi-functional Pry Bar with jagged edges and both 4mm and 6mm hexagonal holes.",
      "Whether you are working on a large engineering project or simply need to change a blade for a daily cutting task, the tool configuration is the ideal choice for you. It offers a quick and convenient blade replacement experience, so you can focus on your work without worrying about the tedious replacement process. This will improve your work efficiency and provide a smoother cutting experience.",
      "The TI-MMS uses an 11# surgical blade for cutting. Replacing the blade of the TI-MMS is fast and easy. When the blade becomes dull from extended use, you don't need to worry about complicated replacement steps. Simply remove the old blade from the handle and quickly insert a new, sharp blade. This simple blade replacement process will get your tool back to optimal cutting performance in no time.",
      "These two small tools can be taken out and used separately. The rotating parts of both tools are equipped with brass washers, so there is no need to worry that when one tool is unfolded, the other tool will be driven together. In addition, a small handle is carefully designed here, so that when cutting tasks need to be completed, the folding surgical knife can be unfolded and used separately.",
      "Both tools are equipped with a 20-degree automatic rebound function to prevent accidental opening. Additionally, these two small tools can serve as a reliable locking mechanism to ensure a smooth and secure user experience. By providing strong support while using these tools, you can easily and smoothly control them. Furthermore, these compact tools can serve as a reliable locking mechanism to ensure a smooth and safe user experience. When using these tools, they provide strong support and can be easily and smoothly controlled.",
      "The ceramic bead is mounted on top of the TI-MMS to assist with emergency escape. The bead is highly durable, making it easy to break glass, and it is also smooth and won't cause injury to your fingers. You can rest assured about your safety.",
      "We have added a rope buckle to the TI-MMS, which enables you to attach a key ring or tie a rope based on your preference. When space is limited, it is crucial to utilize every inch efficiently. The TI-MMS is designed for this purpose and cleverly maximizes space usage, like a space magician. Its compact size allows it to easily fit into your pockets and backpacks, making it your go-to solution. Moreover, the product's versatility enables you to carry a micro-tool kit with ease, ensuring you are prepared to meet any needs without adding unnecessary burden. The TI-MMS design lightens your load and makes life more efficient. Enjoy limitless convenience!",
      "The TI-MMS is unlike most other screwdrivers on the market. This multifunctional screwdriver is made from the highest quality Grade 5 titanium. They are light, rugged, rust-proof, corrosion-resistant and durable.",
      "There are 6 tritium slots on this TI-MMS. If you install the vials, it will glow in the dark, making it easy to locate in darkness.",
      "We offer luminous vials as an additional option.",
      "Luminous vials make light by absorbing light. They can be charged under a bright light source and will glow in the dark for some time. This option is generally less expensive than tritium tubes and may be suitable for those who do not need constant glow or are looking for a cost-effective option. However, the brightness and duration of light depend on the amount and intensity of light absorbed.",
      "Are you planning to bring your TI-MMS on a flight? No worries! Despite the sharp blade and complex components, it's TSA-compliant. Simply remove the blade, dispose of it, and keep the TI-MMS with you. It's undoubtedly the perfect travel companion for all your creative needs.",
      "Would you want a unique and personalized TI-MMS? We offer personalized service by engraving letters or words on the tool.",
      "You can only receive this service when you purchase custom carving separately. We offer three fonts for you to choose from, and you will choose the font in the subsequent survey and provide content for custom engraving",
      "Weighing only 80g, the TI-MMS is effortless whether it's on a keychain, in a pocket, or in a bag. This is thanks to the perfect combination of lightweight titanium alloy and compact design. The lightweight titanium alloy and compact design allow the tool to remain feature-rich while achieving optimal portability, making it the perfect fit for everyday carry (EDC).",
      "The Birth of TI-MMS",
      "In the expansive outdoor world, every adventure is filled with unknowns and surprises. However, when outdoor enthusiasts encounter difficulties, even a minor setback can quickly spoil their journey. In the midst of such challenges, having the right tools can be crucial in restoring their confidence and getting them back on track.",
      "With a deep understanding and concern for outdoor enthusiasts, we set out on a quest to develop a compact tool that offers versatility and portability. Our objective is not just to create a tool, but also to offer reliable support and security to every adventurer. After numerous explorations, experiments, and enhancements, the TI-MMS has finally been created.",
      "CNC Machined Titanium Quality",
      "TI-MMS is crafted using CNC machining from grade 5 titanium material. These are key factors that guarantee the quality of the end product. A series of tests have been conducted to ensure that the design is completed to the highest standard. What you see here are the results of our original design effort, the use of quality materials, advanced CNC machining techniques, and the patience invested in creating this unit.",
      "We are excited to offer free worldwide shipping to all our backers. With this perk, you can have your TI-MMS delivered to your doorstep without any extra charges.

These tires allow the driver to move through mud, swamps, sand, snow and water areas with minimal energy consumption. It has built-in detachable generator and always remains mobile as long as it\u2019s tanked up. The build-in Inverter will provide you with electricity outdoors and allow you to use any power tool.",
      "Tires have low ground pressure. They make sure the bike never gets stuck, doesn\u2019t slip, always seamlessly moving over the surface. Moving over 3-feet deep snowy terrain, the bike only goes 5-7 inches deep. The bike has positive buoyancy. Special side floats, help overcome water obstacles in a vertical position with wheel rotation.",
      "The bike has 2 geared wheels with build-in motors with high torque. We upgraded standard motor wheels by installing bigger magnets. Motors are attached to two sinus controllers.",
      "For battery, we use LiFePo4 cells. This allows us to use the bike in low temperature conditions during winter. Unlike general Lithium-ion batteries, our battery has 2000 charge-discharge cycles. The battery rests in a sealed, waterproof insulated steel case. Charger is also built-in into the same case. We\u2019re using a powerful charger that can fully charge the vehicle in under one hour from a socket. Using gasoline generator allows moving across tricky grounds without depleting the battery. The battery power will only be used when most power should be applied.",
      "We\u2019re using easy removable gasoline generator. If you\u2019re planning trips under 40 miles, you can move freely without it. If you\u2019re in for a long journey, the generator will provide you with unlimited power reserve.",
      "You can put inverter battery inside the case to convert battery energy into AC to charge up your devices. This could be your personal power station with enough supply to sustain light sources and allow you to work with power tools far away from home. Inverter provides enough starting currents to power up energy-intensive devices such as heaters and various power tools.",
      "The wheels allows for great cushioning. In addition, there are two energy-intensive shock absorber on the back wheel. This means a pleasant ride every time. There\u2019s enough space on the back trunk to fit two fuel cans. Energy effective front LED lights provide great visibility. Frontal interface panel has a usb and 12V slots. You can switch between four-wheel drive and rear drive to save more power.",
      "Because our bike has positive buoyancy and can even stay afloat with a driver sitting on it, we had to come up with a way to make it stay afloat in a vertical position and move by aids of wheel rotation. We decided on easily detachable float holders that can be applied to the rare trunk quickly and easily. It takes just about five minutes to get the bike ready to swim. All you have to do is place holders, fix floats, pump them up with car compressor of our built-in 12v socket and you\u2019ll be ready to go. You can move across water surfaces at 3-4 kmph. You can bring it back to land mode just as easily.",
      "We are a team of electric traction / renewable energy enthusiasts who are passionate about making electric powered vehicles. Apart from our 2x2 Ultra Bike we came up with two kinds of electric off-road wheelchairs that can go through any type of terrain. We are also in the process of prototyping our very own electric car. The idea of making Ultra Bike came to us outdoors when we felt the lack of ergonomic two-wheeler we could use to go anywhere and cross water surfaces. We feel like we did a good job and achieved the right result.",

      "The silver cube is the second densest cube after tungsten, with a density of 10.49 g/cm\u00b3 and a volume of 1.84cm\u00b3. Silver is a precious, lustrous transition metal, with a brilliant white colour that makes it stands out. We have chosen to make the silver cube an optional add-on rather than including it within one of the Density Cubes sets in order to ensure both of the standard sets remain affordable. Made from 99.9% pure silver, the silver cube will certainly be the crowning jewel of your Density Cubes collection. To add a solid silver cube to your set(s), select from the add-on options during checkout.",
      "Silver Add-On Density Cube",
      "The original Density Cubes were chosen due to the striking variety between cubes, in terms of density, colour and properties. The newest cubes, zirconium, zinc, tin, nickel and bismuth, are intriguing and varied elements which can either combine with the original Density Cubes set, or exist as a stand-alone set. For instance, zinc is used to coat other metals as an anti-corrosion agent, while bismuth forms rainbow-coloured crystals on its surface upon oxidisation. The solid silver add-on cube was chosen due to its reputation as an extremely precious metal, and the fact that it\u2019s the whitest and most reflective of the precious metals.",

      "KEEPING YOUR COLLECTION SPARKLING",
      "Copper and Iron are naturally prone to slight oxidisation which can make their original colour change to form a patina, while zinc can lose its shine over a long period of time. Here are the best ways to maintain the original condition of your Density Cubes:",
      "Iron: simply keep it as dry as possible.",
      "Copper: clean it by mixing lemon juice or vinegar with a little salt and rubbing it over the surfaces.",
      "Zinc: occasionally lightly oil or wax the surfaces to avoid it's shine eventully becoming dull.",
      "QUALITY CONTROL",
      "Each cube has been precision-cut from the highest purity metals available and laser engraved with its unique periodic symbol, atomic number and name. Every cube is then hand weighed to ensure it fits within a tight tolerance of less than 1% variation* between cubes!",
      "*Variation is due to letter etching and the sanding of corners/edges to make the cubes safe to touch.",
      "Risks and challenges",
      "I do not see any unconquerable challenges arising with the delivery of my project. Density Cubes has been fully prototyped, and I have the capacity to produce the sets in copious volumes if required. But of course with any new project like this, there is a small chance of unanticipated delay, perhaps due to a late shipment arrival or items failing my quality testing and needing to therefore be replaced. In order to hedge and overcome these risks I have accounted for the addition of multiple weeks into the delivery date. I am 100% ready to bring Density Cubes to market, so you too can have a piece of science on your desk. My ultimate goal is to respond promptly to communications and to deliver a great product exactly as you would expect from your pledge.",

      "Empowering Kids with Technology",
      "The Sania Box embedded computer kit contains a one-of-its kind add-on board that aids in developing STEM skills in children. The kit is conceived by 13-year-old Sania Jain who wishes to introduce coding to kids from an early age. The add-on board and other components of the Sania Box kit bring all coding projects to life with their unique features.",
      "THE SANIA BOX ADD-ON BOARD",
      "Central to the Sania Box kit is an embedded computer, an add-on board that fits on the Raspberry Pi 3 or Pi 4 board 40 Pin header. This add-on board is pre-designed to give children with a hands-on experience about coding. It features push buttons, LED lights, and multiple sensors such as the thermal sensor, and the gas sensor. It is also integrated with a 3-digit, 7-segment clock display. Can you imagine the level of fun that kids can have with this kit while learning to program? To make the Sania Box complete in itself, and to enable kids to learn coding right away, the kit supplements the add-on board with an SD Card containing pre-installed programs. The keyboard and mouse in the kit are essential items and the breadboard, wires, LEDs, and resistors create a perfect educational tool.",
      "WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH IT?",
      "One of the features that makes Sania Box unique is the add-on board that is a pre-designed and pre-tested add-on circuit board. It is different from a breadboard and a cable kit that are difficult to assemble without adult help and supervision.  The add-on board is a safe and ready-to-use component unlike a breadboard and cable kit that can hurt kids while assembly. Sania Box plans to create more add-on boards in near-future by working closely with kids and parents.",
      "PYTHON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE",
      "The Raspberry Pi is a compact computer that is preferred by every DIY tech-lover and depends on Python as its preferred programming language. Once you are acquainted with Python, there are very less chances that you will resort to other programming languages for your tasks.",
      "MORE ABOUT THE SANIA BOX",
      "The Sania Box is an embedded computer kit with a special add-on board made for children who are 8 years and above. This build-it-yourself project is made to encourage children to learn about computer engineering including coding, IoT, electronics, and more.",
      "Sania wishes to open up the possibilities of learning computer engineering for every child.  Her mission is to take this fun project to kids nationwide and then worldwide including schools, after-care/enrichment centers, and camps to generate self-driven interest in coding and introductory hands-on electronics and IoT which is otherwise accessible to a select few. Please make a pledge to buy the Sania Box Embedded Computer Kit for the young computer enthusiast you know, or help us raise funds and achieve our goal to expand throughout the country and beyond for young learners.",
      "What\u2019s more, it is made by professionals with the help of Sania who lives and breathes coding in her life. Sania wanted to reach out to other kids, who wish to learn coding in a simple and engaging way with her add-on board and other components in the kit, and the Sania Box offers the perfect opportunity to do so.",
      "WHAT\u2019S IN THE BOX?",
      "The Sania Box add-on board is a hands-on learning tool for all those kids who want to learn programming and create projects based on their codes. Therefore, we have created a kit that kids can start using right away.  Though the Sania Box is complete in itself, it will present the users with a problem where they will have to source multiple components from different places, which would not have been a pleasant experience. For example, the supplied SD Card contains the pre-loaded programs. The keyboard and mouse are essential items and the breadboard, wires, LEDs, and resistors create a perfect learning device.",
      "Here is a comprehensive list of items in the kit:",
      "1. Wired keyboard and mouse",
      "2. Custom Case",
      "3. USB-C Power supply",
      "4. 16 GB SD card with pre-loaded software to help you start programming out of the box",
      "5. HDMI cable to use a TV as your monitor",
      "6. A Raspberry Pi Model 4 with 1 GB Ram and 64-bit quad-core processor to power the add-on board",
      "7. The Sania Box embedded add-on board has the following features:",
      "\u00b7 2 LEDs (Red and Green) that can blink, keep steady, and turn off",
      "\u00b7 Push Button",
      "\u00b7 Thermal Sensor",
      "\u00b7 Touch Sensor",
      "\u00b7 Three-digit, 7-segment Display",
      "\u00b7 Relay Circuit",
      "\u00b7 Light Sensor",
      "\u00b7 Gas Sensor (CO2, methane, etc)",
      "WHY ARE KIDS EXCITED ABOUT IT?",
      "No computer in the world is as easy to put together as Sania Box. The excitement of building your own computer is only the beginning of working on this computer kit.",
      "The Sania Box makes children independent while learning, as everything they need to work is right here in this kit. Just connect it to a TV monitor with an HDMI cable and they are good to go. The kit is supplemented with a keyboard and a mouse so they don\u2019t ask for yours every time they want to work on their computer. However, their freedom of learning on the Sania Box is assisted on every step of the way. The pre-loaded coding programs help them to learn the basics of computer engineering. As they learn, experiment, and evolve, they can access new programs on Sania\u2019s website. The LED lights, thermal sensors, push buttons, gas sensors and other accessories bring their coding experiments to life.",
      "OUR FUTURE DREAM",
      "We dream of a future where we can motivate every child to take up programming and learn it in a simple and easy way. Apart from the in-built programs that kids can learn at various levels, we also publish new programs on our website www.saniabox.com regularly so that young computer science lovers may never run out of projects. We want children to enjoy programming and take it up in the future as a profession. We are aware that technology is set to rule our tomorrow and we want today\u2019s kids to be an important part of that future.",
      "Sania Box aims to provide more add-on boards with various levels of complexity. Therefore, kids at various levels of learning can find useful and new projects to learn. These add-on boards can be purchased separately, or parents can subscribe to us to receive a new add-on board every month.",
      "We want experimentation to be an important aspect of learning and therefore encourage all users of Sania Box to create their own coding projects. This way kids will be able to create their own IoT devices and programs for learning and entertainment.",
      "COMMUNITY OUTREACH",
      "As a part of her community outreach program, Sania visited a few lesser-privileged schools in India. She spoke to hundreds of children in these schools about coding and its role in the future who received her lectures enthusiastically. Unfortunately, most of the schools do not give enough emphasis on computer science in primary and middle school levels. She also demonstrated the use of the Sania Box especially with the add-on board with its multiple features.",
      "WHY IS CODING A NECESSITY?",
      "It is disheartening to know that only 20% of the developers who are between the ages 18-24 today, started coding before they were 16 years old as compared to kids of the 70s and 80s when this number was almost 50%. The availability of technology has lessened the drive to learn coding in today\u2019s kids. This needs to change as the future will be ruled by technology and coders will play an important part in it. Most schools do not offer computer education to younger kids and the Sania Box can be quite handy when it comes to kids learning code on their own.",
      "TEAM",
      "Sania Jain, Alok Jain, Vikas Shukla, Vishwas Jain",
      "The team involved in bringing this project to life is special in many ways. This project was conceived by our youngest team member Sania who wishes all kids to have a real-life, practical knowledge of programming and what it can do. Her dream became our mission and we as professionals stepped in to create the Sania Box, a DIY computer kit with one of the best add-on boards available that can offer hands-on learning of programming to its users. Our team of technology experts, designers, and programmers from the Silicon Valley at www.moonshotjr.com  have endeavored to build this computer kit to assist, educate, and empower kids to be the tech leaders of tomorrow.",

      "Eliminate 99.99% of airborne particles with groundbreaking plasma technology & never replace filters",
      "OneLife X is a high-performance air purifier with revolutionary plasma technology that filters your air with clinical precision. It uses a high-precision laser sensor to track even the smallest detectable particles in your air. Unlike other air purifiers, OneLife X produces no harmful ozone and has no costly filters to replace.",
      "To say Onelife X is the best air purifier to hit the market would be an understatement\u2014it\u2019s the future of air purification!",
      "Our next-generation air purifying plasma filter eliminates 99.99% of airborne particles without the need to replace the filter, ever.",
      "OneLife X uses a high-precision laser sensor that detects particles as small as 1 micrometer, then the plasma technology removes particles down to 0.01 micrometers, meaning it removes even viruses and ultrafine particles out of your breathing air that most purifiers miss.",
      "Most air purifiers use standard HEPA filters that are incapable of capturing particles smaller than 0.3 micrometer.",
      "OneLife X has metallic plates in the filter that act like giant magnets for all the pollutants in the air. When air is pulled into the device, it passes through the plasma field where pollution particles get charged up (ionized) so they stick right to the collector sheets.",
      "Using this plasma field to ionize the particles instead of forcing air through a thick filter means there's no restriction of airflow, so One Life X requires very little energy, runs virtually silently, and generates no harmful ozone.",
      "The independent lab test by IUTA shows that \u201cOneLife X can provide per hour, on average, about 121 cubic meters of air free of particles, including viruses and small exhaled droplets that are potentially virus-laden. The filtration efficiency for larger exhaled droplets is even larger, resulting in a CADR of 131 cubic meters per hour.\u201d",
      "The independent lab also tested for Ozone Emission. IUTA concluded that OneLife X does NOT add ozone to the room even after 60 minutes of constant purification. The lab stated: \u201cThe amount of emitted ozone lies with (1.6 \u00b1 1.8) ppb substantially below the limit of 50 ppb specified by UL 867-37.\u201d",
      "In the graph below you see the ozone concentration as a black line (with the OneLife X running full speed) and a red line (the natural background levels of ozone that are always present). They are almost identical and far lower than the officially accepted concentration of ozone in a room.",
      "HEPA? No thanks\u2014sounds like a bad infection.",
      "The OneLife X plasma filter never needs to be replaced. It\u2019s washable and dishwasher safe, meaning it won\u2019t pollute the environment with non-recyclable plastics and filter waste.",
      "This is as sustainable and affordable as it gets.",
      "Other air purifiers use pricey HEPA filters that need to be changed often and cost more to operate. HEPA technology hasn't been updated in more than 70 years!",
      "OneLife X delivers the highest purification performance with the lowest energy consumption. At just 6 watts, it consumes less than an average LED lamp! This means you get the most clinically clean air while saving money on energy bills.",
      "Other air purifiers cost $30-120 per year because they require a high-speed fan to press air through fibreglass mats inside the air filter. High-speed fans and pressure means loud, disrupting noise levels plus increased energy consumption, resulting in higher energy bills.",
      "Our technology purifies the air without restricting airflow, so it doesn't need high-energy fan pressure. This enables us to run the fan at a super low ventilation rate, making the purifier absolutely silent",
      "It\u2019s so quiet you can run it right next to your bed\u2014try that with a HEPA filter!",
      "OneLife X looks and feels like a piece of furniture. Our team of designers crafted OneLife X to fit effortlessly and beautifully into any modern-day home or office.",
      "Plus, it operates standing or laying flat, so it fits in any space.",
      "The textile cover is made from recycled PET plastic bottles, keeping that discarded plastic out of landfills and from breaking down into microplastics that can cause serious health issues.",
      "OneLife X\u2019s renewable filter design makes it the most sustainable filter on the market, purifying your air while protecting the plant.",
      "OneLife X alerts you when it is time to wash the filter, and has three air-purifying modes:",
      "OneLife X provides clinically pure air exactly where you want it with a tilt feature that lets you deliver clean-air immediately within your personal air space.",
      "The OneLife X app gives you detailed data on indoor air quality and outdoor pollutants so you can monitor your air quality from anywhere, effortlessly.",
      "Plus, the app lets you input your personal air purification needs (like if you have asthma, allergies or pets) and OneLife X adjusts its settings automatically!",
      "In addition to measuring pollutants in your air, OneLife X also measures temperature and humidity.",
      "The OneLife X app displays indoor AND outdoor air quality levels using the BreezoMeter. By getting the live outdoor pollution data from local air quality indices (AQIs), we are able to recommend if the air quality is good enough for your outdoor activities or for you to open the windows.",
      "The average human takes 17,000 breaths a day and inhales 2,000 gallons of air. Pure air is for everyone\u2014and so is OneLife X.",
      "*Add a carbon filter to your OneLife X to ensure that in addition to all the particles, all odors get absorbed from your air. Gases will get trapped and retained inside the activated carbon to provide you with clean air without any bad odors.",
      "New to Indiegogo? No problem. Follow these simple steps to get your own OneLife X.",
      "At the end of the campaign, we\u2019ll send you a survey to get your shipping information and deliver your OneLife X when manufacturing is completed",
      "Our story started over five years ago in Germany. We\u2019re a team of scientists, engineers and dreamers who recognized that the air that we breathe is harming our health\u2014and no health tech company was going to fix it (they just love their business models around filter replacement too much to upgrade the technology).",
      "So we started OneLife X with one simple goal: to create clean air with a clear conscience. Our mission to improve air home quality around the globe wouldn\u2019t be meaningful if it harmed the environment (like HEPA filters do), so we set out to create a completely new generation of air purification.",
      "With no filter to replace, the lowest energy profile in the market, the greenest technology available and a high performance plasma filter that catches even the smallest pollutants, the OneLife X you see today has exceeded our wildest expectations.",

      "Yes, one or two people can go off hammocking by themselves. But what of hammocking with ALL of your friends? Scoop up the dog! Invite the mailman! BaseCamp is a hammock experience for extroverts. String it up at a picnic! Bring it to the park! Fill it up at farmers markets, summer camps, beach parties, camping trips, anywhere that people gather and connect.",
      "HOW'S THE WEATHER OVER THERE? ...it's not always possible to hang multiple hammocks close together.",
      "Get your feet off my face ...two people per hammock is limiting in a group and can be a bit too snug.",
      "Who brought the ratchet? ...platform hammocks and tents hold more people but are heavy, less portable, and require tools.",
      "The higher you hang the farther you fall ...Stacking hammocks can be inconvenient and dangerous.",
      "Like beards, BIGGER is just BETTER when it comes to hammocking! You have more space. You can fit more people. BaseCamp only weighs as much as a box of wine (56oz) and is the size of a watermelon. Yet it holds 550lbs!",
      "3 full grown burly men OR",
      "4 recently reconciled opposing teammates of a beer pong tournament OR",
      "5 glittery girls with flowers in their hair OR",
      "6 middle school students and all of their angst OR",
      "Too many kindergartners!",
      "Our hammocking community is empowering women and their families in Northern Thailand. We are a small operation, employing a team of seamstresses making each hammock by hand from the comfort of their own homes. No mass factory manufacturing, no child labor, and no outsourcing...we operate completely in-house!",
      "We focus on cottage-construction techniques rather than mass factory production. The result is superior craftsmanship and a ripple effect of positivity and empowerment. Good vibes from our community to yours!",

      "We operate in a small garment manufacturing village in Thailand where seamstresses generally work in factories that recognize minimum wage laws. However, some women are physically unable to work in factories or simply can\u2019t leave home for 10+ hours each day. Some local garment manufacturers will hire stay-at-home seamstresses knowing they can pay exceptionally low wages almost unnoticed \u2013 sometimes paying as little as 8 cents per pair of pants sewn, well below Thailand's legal minimum.",
      "Flying Squirrel Outfitters strives to break this cycle of limited opportunity by creating jobs that are sustainable, location and schedule flexible, and fairly compensated. At-home hammock making has become a growing source of income for our team of seamstresses and their families. As our company grows, we look forward to expanding these opportunities for more women in the village.",
      "Rest easy in your hammock knowing that the hands that made it are thriving as a result of its creation.",
      "Hi, I\u2019m Brian. Four years ago I quit my comfy job in Seattle, sold my stuff, and headed abroad seeking something new. While traveling, I fell in love with Chiang Mai, Thailand and decided to sink some roots. I began working with local seamstresses, making travel hammocks for tourists. What started as an idea became an experiment and grew into a passion project called Flying Squirrel Outfitters.",
      "I\u2019m inspired by travel and the outdoors. Seeking lush natural beauty has guided me through many stages of my life, including the move to Thailand. I am also inspired by \u2018do good\u2019 companies that are defined by their impact. They challenge the status quo and raise standards of quality and compassion. Flying Squirrel Outfitters combines my love of the planet with my love of the people on the planet.",
      "I have a background in marketing and sales at a prominent startup in Seattle. I have personally been managing the Flying Squirrel team and operations for the past year and a half. It has been a wild ride and an enormous learning experience with lots of good vibes along the way.",
      "We are enticed by the vision of GIANT hammocks hanging all over the world. We are asking for help because our small company doesn't yet have the capacity to launch such a capital-intensive new product alone. The hammocks purchased in this campaign will allow us to buy materials in bulk and offer more opportunity to our team of seamstresses. One small step for the hammocking community, one GIANT step for Flying Squirrel Outfitters!",
      "If you are not into hammocks ...what's wrong with you? Just kidding, We are sure you have your reasons (childhood trauma from being forgotten in a hammock on a family vacation?). But you can still help!",
      "Sharing our campaign page with your friends is massively helpful!",
      "If we don\u2019t reach our goal, we absolutely will fulfill all items ordered.  There may, however, be delays depending on what is possible with the amount we raise. We will keep you updated and promise quick and clear communication.",
      "In the case that we do reach our goal (fingers crossed!), there will still be risks and challenges. We have been in business for over a year, we are not so idealistic that we are not prepared.",
      "In either case, we are committed to getting this right, that's a promise! In the name of preparation, here are a few risks and challenges that we've already thought of:",
      "Manufacturing Delays",
      "\u2022 We've already done large production runs before so we're confident in our seamstresses and team to continue to follow our finely oiled production line; however, securing the material from our sources can have unforeseen setbacks, but generally not.",
      "\u2022 We stay in constant communication with our team from prototype to production to assure the highest quality end product.",
      "\u2022 We always work on-site with our seamstresses for new products to resolve any challenges quickly and efficiently.",
      "Shipping Delays",
      "\u2022 We exclusively use DHL Express when shipping from Thailand which offers us the lowest cost per piece we could find at our modest sales volume. They have been tried and true so we believe we should continue to receive the same level of service.",

      "World's Most Advanced Wireless Headphonesly",
      "Meet the Lynxsonic 4:33\u2019 Wireless headphones!",
      "World's best Active Noise Cancelling technology, state-of-the-art sound quality, touch control, incredible long battery life, headphone to headphone sharing functionality, super easy wireless charging and a form factor with a purposeful design. Meet the Lynxsonic 4:33 bluetooth headphones.",
      "Our headphones are packed with functions to enhance your sound experience without overcomplicating handling or compromising on design:",
      "At Lynxsonic we have one mission: delivering headphones that live up to its promise: perfection in sound and silence.",
      "You might ask though: how do the 4:33 hold up against the premium competition? Good question! We put an overview together that will help you to make a smart and informed decision:",
      "Getting a premium product that outperforms the competition for a less than half the price is our promise to you!",
      "As seen in:",
      "Check out what users say about the Lynxsonic 4:33:",
      "We know that sound quality is the most important feature in a headphone. That\u2019s why we spent a long time to get a crisp and full sound that makes listening to your favorite music a delight. No matter at home on the couch, traveling around the world or sharing with your friends. In order to make the Lynxsonic 4:33 truly special, we use the newest Bluetooth 5.0 technology. We wanted to make sure that you are ahead of everyone else.",
      "The best sound is what you most enjoy listening to. The Lynxsonic 4:33 will deliver on your expectations for super crisp sound with powerful beats. Wireless listening has highest sound quality ensured by both our nearly perfect acoustic structure design and Qualcomm\u00ae aptX\u2122, aptX\u2122 Low Latency, aptX\u2122 HD.",
      "Qualcomm\u00ae aptX\u2122 HD audio ensures Lynxsonic 4:33 can deliver High Definition (HD) audio. It preserves sound data through the audio transmission, resulting in a \u2018better-than-CD\u2019 listening experience.",
      "Especially our active noise cancelling technology will block any outside noises that would distract from enjoying every song or insatiable movie experience. The total harmonic distortion is less than 1% @1KHz 1mW and the frequency response is between 20Hz to 20KHz. We make sure that the latest audio technology goes inside the Lynxsonic 4:33.",
      "In order to give you the best wireless sound experience possible we used the bluetooth CSR8675 chip that offers a walking range up to 20 meters (open air) and the shareMe technology enables headphone to headphone sharing via bluetooth. Currently there is nothing better in the market to guarantee that wireless sound experience is nothing short of amazing.",
      "Powered by Qualcomm\u00ae aptX\u2122 HD.",
      "Plenty of headphone brand claims to have active noise cancelling technology, but only a few can truly live up to that promise. Bose, Sennheiser and Beats have solid systems.",
      "Our goal was to exceed and benchmark our technology with the best. The result is remarkable. We deployed 5 microphones not only on the outside of the headphones, but also inside to enhance ANC capabilities.",
      "In the end we are able to reach an ANC value of 36db, unparalleled. We call this the joy of silence.",
      "Buttons can be really cool and useful, but we don't like them all over the product. We wanted to keep everything as smooth and intuitive as possible. That is why the Lynxsonic headphones only have two buttons: 1. an anc&bluetooth/pairing button and 2. a talk-free button.",
      "All other functions can be controlled by touch: swiping and tapping. you don\u2019t need to fumble for tiny buttons hidden somewhere in the back, all you need to do are bold strokes or simple taps to manoeuvre and control volume, skipping songs, pause and accepting calls.",
      "Simplicity at its best and this is how it works:",
      "Enjoying wireless sound heavily hinges on battery life. Nothing worse than traveling and the headphones die shortly after. For all of you that demand unparalleled battery life we packaged a 1000 mah battery in the Lynxsonic for more than 40 hours of non-stop bluetooth usage!",
      "Of course we balanced the weight to not compromise on comfort. You can go through weeks of listening to your favourite music or podcasts and don\u2019t need to think about charging.",
      "Just grab and go, ready when you are! Especially for all you travelers and commuters, we developed the Lynxsonic with you in mind.",
      "We know how important sharing is. That is why we offer two ways to share music when you are on the bus, on the plane or simply at home watching a movie with others. If you have two bluetooth headphones, both can easily connect and share the same song or watch the same movie.",
      "If the other person does not have a bluetooth headphone, you can simply plug the other headphone or earplugs into your Lynxsonic to enjoy together.",
      "Actually, two Lynxsonic headphones and two non-bluetooth headphones/plugs can be sharing the same audio/video file: basically a family affair.",
      "That is sharing simplified and purposefully built-in, because we know that sharing your favourite new album or watching a film together is twice as good as alone!",
      "We believe in a world of wireless electronic products. That's why we developed the 4:33 with wireless charging. Easy as pie, just drop it on the wireless charging matt and in no time you have 40 hours of music at hand.",
      "Especially when travelling there is always the question before going to sleep: what device shall I charge over night? Now you don't need to compromise: Smart phone, smart watch, headphones, all fit on the charging matt (which we offer to you as well) and when you wake up, everything is charged and ready to go.",
      "Design plays a big role and we deeply care about unique, purposeful design. Everything starts with strokes of genius that evolves and morphes into a beautiful product.",
      "We truly believe that a product should combine iconic design that is original and stands out from the rest. That's why the Lynxsonic 4:33 are not oval shaped, but angular, matching the facial structure along the jaw bone.",
      "In the end everything we look at, touch and interact with should have a design that is purposeful, deliberate and makes sense to us and most importantly to you.",
      "We are very fortunate to work with one of the most distinguished designers of our time who brings over 25 years of experience from the car and electronics industry to the table: Simon Loasby.",
      "With Simon on board the journey of Lynxsonic is also a journey through design and a lesson in how to create something that is packed with technology, a display of comfort with eye-catching, differentiating, provoking and desirable design features.",
      "Let's hear what Simon has to say about the design, the features and why he designed the Lynxsonic 4:33 this way:",
      "Headphones need to be durable and lightweight, stylish and practical and small enough to accompany any journey.",
      "We are using materials that matter and that make sense. Super sturdy headband aluminium core with a durable and flexible plastic cover to give it stability, flexibility and style.",
      "Ear pieces can swivel and extend to provide the perfect fit and comfort. Metal hinges to make sure nothing breaks, no matter how many times you fold and pack. The super soft leather ear cushions are made for comfort and also flexible in order to match your head shape.",
      "All of our headbands need to withstand 30,000 bends. Only then we know that it is excellent and good enough for you.",
      "We have done this for our prototypes and after rounds of re-engineering we found the perfect combination of sturdiness, flexibility, style and comfort that also passed the bending test.",
      "While the headbands have a smooth and sturdy top part paired with a strong aluminum core, the inside comprises of soft materials.",
      "The magic of sound and silence is deeply embedded in the ear pieces. It needs to be small and yet powerful, it needs to hold pc boards, chips, batteries, ANC modules, sound boards and ports for plugs, buttons and microphones while staying cool and comfortable.",
      "We managed to develop sound technology that is all of that above and still fits snuggly into our custom shaped ear pieces.",
      "Our team of structural designers and sound engineers did a remarkable job to make this happen. The cushions are leather wrapped memory foam pieces that offer remarkable comfort for wearing them every day and especially on long journeys.",
      "Traveling with your Lynxsonics requires a casing that protects them from scratches, damages, dirt, theft and other harms. Since we have been developing and producing sturdy headphone casings for over a decade, you can be assured that you will get a high quality product.",
      "Every casing comes with an airplane adaptor, 1/4-inch stereo-plug adaptor, detachable audio cable, USB-C charging cable, proper cable storage and a soft cloth protection bag.",
      "If you decide to get the deluxe wireless charging version, there will be a Qi charging pad in the travel case as well.",
      "We put together a very interesting basket of different product categories, a base version and a deluxe version, an offer to purchase pairs and a family pack that has the lowest price possible.",
      "We understand that there are different tastes for colors. To keep it simple and to reduce costs (which results in a lower purchase price for you), we limited the color choice to: white/grey and black/copper.",
      "We are humble, but confident that our headphones will find many friends through this campaign.",
      "We look at Lynxsonic as more than a project or a product. For us this is the beginning of something exciting and adventurous. In order to get to the point where we felt comfortable to release our first products, we worked very hard and constantly questioned what we achieved in order to get further.",
      "We tested and tested and tested and improved further. That is why we call it a studio. It is a place where we engineer technology that offers sound and silence, that brings together the desire to craft headphones, delivering emotions to our customers and joy to their ears.",
      "Our studio is equipped with machinery to test every product meticulously until we are convinced that it is ready. But in the end, we want your opinion to continuously improve.",
      "At Lynxsonic we have one mission: delivering headphones that live up to its promise: perfection in sound and silence.",
      "We don't want to over-promise crazy AI technologies, touch-screens glued to the earpieces or mind-reading sensors that would cause a massive delay until the product is ready.",
      "We had a very clear mission from the beginning: amazing headphones with the world's best active noise cancelling technology that provides the ultimate sound experience and give you more than 40 hours of wireless listening.",
      "In order to ensure delivering 100% on our promise, we started Lynxsonic with a true veteran in the audio tech business and a good friend of ours for many years: Charles Lau. Charles has been developing and manufacturing audio technology for more than 15 years.",
      "His production expertise, deep engineering knowledge and very high quality standards are the perfect foundation for Lynxsonic. Over the past 2 years we worked together to design, prototype and fully develop the Lynxsonic 4:33.",
      "We are very happy with the final product that is designed with traveller and commuters in mind offering unparalleled battery life of 40+ hours wireless listening with Active Noise Cancelling on. Easy to wear, long lasting, flexible, foldable to a small package - we understand what is needed to make your journey as pleasant as possible.",
      "Over the course of the past year we have tested our prototypes on short and long haul traveling in order to ensure that the 4:33 are a true companion on every journey.",
      "All together, we have put a basket of incredible little functions and features into our headphones in order to make your listening experience seamless, joyful and easy to use. You never want to go without Lynxsonics, ever again.",
      "We set out to create the best pair of headphones in the market for the best possible price. We call this promise accessible premium.",
      "The Lynxsonic team consists of a unique collaboration of experienced professionals and sound lovers that came together to develop the best pair of headphones in the market. Together we have vast experience in different areas for making exceptional audio technology.",
      "Simon is one of the world's leading car designers with a track record in designing iconic automobiles as well as really cool projects like the People's Car Project.",
      "Florian has been working in Strategy, Marketing and starting tech companies in different markets for the past 15 years.",
      "Charles knows everything about audio technology: he has engineered, manufactured and sold his own audio technology products for over 15 years. He is a veteran in the audio tech industry and has his own manufacturing, testing and production facility.",
      "Birger has been working on creative projects around the globe. He understands how everything needs to come together in order to turn a creative thought into an emotional product.",
      "Sara worked for a variety of tech companies building supply chain managements, partner networks and sales structures. She understands the ins and outs of finding the right partnerships to bring projects alive and promised kept.",
      "To develop the Lynxsonic 4:33 we took extra time to get everything right. Technology can be fragile and needs careful planning. Even more so when applied in a wearable product. From initial idea to final prototype we spend more than 2 years.",
      "Sound and silence in perfection was our goal. Our inspiration for this combination came from the three-movement composition by composer John Cage.",
      "His bold work gave us the courage to create a bold and exceptional pair of headphones. Naming our first Lynxsonic product 4:33 is an homage and standing ovation to his remarkable work.",
      "Enjoy sound and silence from the one and only John Cage:",
      "Aftersales is a crucial element of every physical product. Since we are an experienced audio tech team with existing structures, we have a complete after sales process in place that will take care of you and your Lynxsonic 4:33.",
      "Not only will we take care of your product when repair is needed, but we are able to get original spare parts from our suppliers to ensure that your Lynxsonic 4:33 is always perfect, even when fixed.",
      "We have rich experience in designing, developing and manufacturing audio technology. This experience makes us very confident that we will fully deliver the Lynxsonic 4:33 at exceptional quality and within our timeline. We do however, want to remark that even the most well planned manufacturing process can meet unpredictable hiccups.",
      "All parts, technologies, chips and materials have been sourced already. The market for resistor and capacitor sometimes experiences unstable conditions. This is not new to us and we know how to handle those situations and have a back-up plan.",
      "We have thoroughly tested the Lynxsonic 4:33 with iOS, Android and Windows systems to ensure perfect connectivity.",
      "With this in mind, the entire Lynxsonic team and our suppliers will continue to develop the Lynxsonic 4:33 at the highest possible standards, so that you can enjoy them every time.",

      "AirTaste will become an extra hand in your kitchen. Let AirTaste cook for you and free up your time for other interests rather than cooking all day. Became a multi-tasker and spend more quality time with your family.",
      "Just add your ingredients to AirTaste. Place it on the stove. Go play with your kids, watch a movie, or read a book\u2026 and come back when it\u2019s ready!",
      "And the heat is then distributed evenly across the entire surface of your pot \u2014 even its sides! \u2014 making sure you eat a fully-cooked, nutrient-rich meal every time.",
      "Cooking healthy meals doesn\u2019t need to be a challenge. Or time-consuming. Or something only Gordon Ramsay can do!",
      "With the magic of AirTaste and its patented Air Layer Technology, you\u2019ll be cooking healthier meals effortlessly in no time.",
      "With conventional pots, food burns, boils over, sticks to the bottom, and cooks unevenly\u2026 so people have created tons of appliances that attempt to solve specific problems, and cook a limited variety of foods.",
      "Your stove heats an outer layer, that heats an inner air chamber, before heating the inner layer and your food.",
      "With its Air Layer Technology, German hollow super-cool stainless steel handles, and its ultra-light construction, AirTaste is the advanced cookware that simplifies your kitchen and makes it easier for you to cook good food.",
      "AirTaste\u2019s steady heat preserves foods\u2019 essential nutrients \u2014 and precious time! \u2014 no matter how thick that bolognese, jam, soup, sauce\u2026 and everything in between!",
      "AirTaste\u2019s evenly heated layer of air makes sure every meal is always thoroughly and evenly cooked with almost no input.",
      "You know how when you defrost food in the microwave it\u2019ll make one side burning hot while another is still frozen? And don\u2019t get me started on that microwave \u2018flavor\u2019...",

      "We can\u2019t legally say it tastes as though it were fresh\u2026 but it kind of does! ?",
      "Avoid using the microwave to defrost, or waiting long hours for your frozen ingredients to defrost manually. With its layer of air, AirTaste effectively conducts heat and allows your meat and vegetables to defrost evenly and cook simultaneously.",
      "AirTaste elevates your food from the flame with a layer of air and a non-toxic non-stick coating. It makes cooking so easy, and this ensures it\u2019s cooked consistently, at safer temperatures, and with no risk of burning or smoke.  Meaning you get healthier meals and a healthier living environment!",
      "No Burning = No Smoke + More Nutrients!",
      "In a conventional pot \u2014 where temperatures vary by over 200 degrees between the edges and the center \u2014 wild convection currents are formed as the hot water rises solely from the center.",

      "You\u2019ll preserve the healthy nutrients, won\u2019t water down the flavor, and will avoid the unhealthy burning of greases, butter, and oils.",
      "Heat is the most important factor that sets apart the healthiest meal from the most harmful. When you use your regular pan, the extreme heat concentrated in the bottom-center can turn proteins into carcinogens and omega 3 oils into trans fats.",
      "AirTaste\u2019s patented air layer gives you more control overheating, so every meal you cook preserves all the good nutrients!",
      "Did you know that coal turns into diamond under extreme heat and pressure? And what about when you oxidize and anodize Aluminum to turn it into Sapphire?",
      "AirTaste\u2019s non-stick coating is applied over a base of Sapphirine Ceramic. This is a much stronger base and ensures much longer durability. As it inherits the gemstone\u2019s toughness \u2014 it\u2019s the 2nd hardest gemstone \u2014 and food-safe properties.",
      "Non-stick coatings contain PTFE which becomes toxic above 500 degrees Fahrenheit (260 Celsius). Typical pots and pans can easily reach these temperatures, and toxic PTFEs are often found in home-cooked meals!",
      "With AirTaste\u2019s air layer, the inner layer doesn\u2019t go above a safe 392 degrees Fahrenheit (200 Celsius), meaning your food and AirTaste will always be safe and healthy!",
      "AirTaste\u2019s coating is made without PFOA, a toxic chemical typically found in non-stick coatings.",
      "Cooking fumes contain carcinogenic and mutagenic compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heterocyclic compounds. Big words. Big problems.",
      "AirTaste hardly burns foods, and lab results show up to 100 times less toxic fumes are created by meals cooked with AirTaste.",
      "AirTaste is made of Hith-quality materials, it's produced in Korea and handles and knobs in Germany.",
      "Gone are the days of non-stick coatings chipping or just wearing down in under a year!",
      "Thanks to AirTaste\u2019s super durable Sapphirine Ceramic Base Layer, the inner non-stick coating lasts many more years of cooking.",
      "AirTaste\u2019s German-made stainless steel handles stay cooler for longer. Even as your AirTaste gets hotter, thanks to their hollow design! The handle temperatures does not reach extream temperatures unless flames touch the handles.",
      "Dutch Ovens and AirTaste, although the temperature distribution gap is huge as we introduced with the cake cooking comparison above, Cast Iron Pots are known as the cookware that cooks delicious meals and has an even heat distribution before AirTaste was introduced! What also makes it different between Cast Iron pans and AirTaste is they do this using thick and heavy cast iron sides.",
      "AirTaste is 2.5 times lighter than a Dutch oven or cast iron pans of the same size!",
      "Cleaning is a breeze with AirTaste\u2019s non-stick inner coating. One quick rinse will leave your AirTaste sparkling clean! AirTaste is also 100% dishwasher safe for the times when you don\u2019t want to clean it by hand!",
      "Our factory has been producing some of the best cookware for over 50 years. And AirTaste is the next generation of high-quality cookware.",
      "But we know that Kickstarters sometimes overpromise and often underdeliver. So in order to make sure you\u2019re 100% happy with your AirTaste, we\u2019re offering backers an extended 3-year warranty.",
      "We studied the most popular pot shapes and sizes to give you what you need. AirTaste comes in 4 standard sizes to meet all your culinary needs. From a Deep Pot to a Saute Pan:",

      "For 50 years my father enjoyed the unique opportunity of combining his 2 greatest passions \u2014 engineering and food \u2014 in producing some of Korea\u2019s highest quality cookware.",
      "For decades, he tried to solve the problem of burning food and water boiling over with a magical elusive pot. He tried different materials. Different shapes. Different sizes. But nothing worked.",
      "Then one day during a freezing cold winter, he was warming up in front of our traditional big coal stove.",
      "And a wild thought hit him, \u201cOur rice pot fits perfectly within the hole at the top of the stove! What if I just place the pot in the hole?\u201d",
      "No boilover.",
      "No burning.",

    "description": "A camera with a macro function capable of shooting clear photos and 4K/60fps videos.",
    "company_name": "AM KOV",
    "allParagraphs": [
      "A camera with a macro function capable of shooting clear photos and 4K/60fps videos.",
      "The AMKOV R5 is a versatile mirrorless camera that combines both DC and DV functions but also incorporates a 2G6P crystal clear lens and SONY CMOS, enabling clear photo and video shooting. What's even more surprising is its macro shooting function, which allows you to easily capture the details of small objects and showcase the beauty of the microscopic world. The autofocus function is also outstanding, capturing moments instantly and making shooting more convenient and quick. Overall, the AMKOV R5 is a super practical camera that can meet your needs for outdoor and travel photography.",
      "Most of the mirrorless cameras on the market are expensive, which is not friendly to students or amateur photography enthusiasts with low incomes. However, the AMKOV R5 is not only affordable but also capable of capturing clear images with a simple and easy-to-carry operation. Compared to DSLR cameras with the same performance, purchasing the AMKOV R5 is more cost-effective.",
      "The AMKOV R5 is easy to use, much like using a smartphone, making it effortless for daily photo-taking or video recording. The camera features a SONY CMOS sensor, supporting 48MP high-resolution pixels and 4K/60fps high-definition video recording, allowing you to capture high-quality images and record the world clearly at any time.",
      "Capture every detail with the AMKOV R5's 2G6P crystal-clear lens. Get up close and personal with its macro shooting effect, perfect for capturing the intricate details of pollen and leaf textures.",
      "The AMKOV R5 mirrorless camera features an autofocus function that automatically blurs the background to emphasize the subject. This makes it easier to capture beautiful, artistic photos, and improves shooting efficiency for fast-moving actions. With accurate focus, the AMKOV R5 camera ensures superior quality photos.",
      "The 5X optical zoom and 8X digital zoom functions enable you to capture clearer and more detailed photos without getting too close to your subject. The optical zoom allows you to capture wider scenes without moving the camera, while the digital zoom further expands your shooting range, allowing you to capture details more clearly and without worrying about space limitations, resulting in better photos.",
      "Time-Lapse Video",
      "Allowing you to shoot slow-motion videos or capture scenes with rich details, such as sunsets, changing landscapes, and blooming flowers. In slow-motion, you can capture details like falling petals or dripping water droplets that are difficult to capture at normal speed. The time-lapse recording function can better showcase these scenes.",
      "Snapshot Video",
      "Allowing you to compress long video footage into a short video, such as capturing a sunrise, drifting clouds, or traffic congestion in the city. It enables you to better document these long processes and makes watching them more interesting and vivid.",
      "Loop Recording",
      "Enabling you to loop record videos. The camera automatically records video and overwrites the previous footage when the storage card is full. You don't need to manually delete outdated videos, nor worry about running out of storage space, saving you time and effort. Additionally, the larger the memory card, the more content it can record.",
      "With automatic photography, all you need to do is set the shooting conditions and the camera will take care of the rest. The camera can also automatically adjust settings like exposure and white balance based on the shooting environment to ensure clear and accurate photos.",
      "Continuous Photography",
      "With continuous photography, you can take multiple photos in a short period of time, increasing the likelihood of capturing successful shots and capturing more exciting moments.",
      "With its built-in retractable fill light, AMKOV R5 pops up the fill light at the touch of a button to illuminate your shooting vision and enrich the light and shadows.",
      "The AMKOV R5 features a 3.0-inch IPS display with a high-definition resolution of 360 x 640P, offering clear and vivid visual effects. With this screen, you can easily view and edit the photos and videos that you captured.",
      "This 180\u00b0 flippable screen makes shooting more flexible, allows for shooting at low or high angles and facilitates menu operations and photo previews, greatly enhancing your user experience.",
      "Using a lens hood can reduce reflections and scattered light, improve contrast and saturation of photos, ensure the quality of photo shooting, and also protect the lens from scratches and other damages.",
      "The AMKOV R5 is equipped with a Type-C charging port and an 1300mAh rechargeable lithium battery, which not only provides faster charging speed and a more convenient connection, but also allows for continuous shooting.",
      "AMKOV R5 provides larger storage capacity, higher image quality, more convenient data transfer, and greater data security. This means that when you are traveling and taking photos, you no longer need to frequently change memory cards.",
      "External tripod enables more stable and convenient shooting, allowing for better composition and precise positioning of the camera. You can also take a wider range of photos, such as night scenes, star trails, water droplets, and more. Additionally, placing the camera on the tripodmakes taking selfies easier.",
      "This feature is especially beneficial for situations that demand mobility, such as travel and outdoor photography. It facilitates effortless and comfortable camera carrying, enhancing your convenience. Furthermore, it offers greater flexibility in selecting various shooting angles, enabling you to capture unique and captivating photos and videos.",
